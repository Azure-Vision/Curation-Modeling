UpliftingNews,removed,well flu vaccines simply cant work the way they are marketed and there are problems with additive and adjuvants if a vial isnt properly mixed it can cause serious problems and infants are extremely overdosed at a young age the pertussis vaccine push a few years back with those awful baby gasping whooping cough commercials actually caused a severe outbreak of said whooping cough adults getting it and then giving it to their children oh and hpv vaccines and guillian barre syndrome even if they dont cause autism there are issues with them and tell that to the parents that went to the doctor with a bouncing baby and then woke up to a potato the next day there is a wide area between two sides of an argument the truth tends to lie somewhere between

UpliftingNews,removed,pageants are about more than just plain appearances they have a culture attitudes trends etc its about being a whole package body charisma face eloquence articulation talents etc someone who isnt a stunner can do very well honestly how they hold themselves their body and their makeup factor more imo
UpliftingNews,removed,why are you subbed to rupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,removed,you seem like an enormous douche
UpliftingNews,removed,you must have some unrealistically high standards i think shes really hot
UpliftingNews,removed,going to hell because youre gay is not uplifting at all
UpliftingNews,removed,i get you resent being called out doesnt change my opinion still a dick
UpliftingNews,removed,its not even close to being the best hell st louis has better looking news reporters
UpliftingNews,removed,its hard to care when hate crimes now mean waaa he said something i dont like bullying is a part of life grow thicker skin and deal with it bunch of pussies
UpliftingNews,removed,for real shes a dog only reason it got into the contest let alone won is because of pathetic good for her votes
UpliftingNews,removed,it means i hate my parents the lgbt community has a big circlejerk about terms and dont even correct one another when they use the wrong ones because it might offendhurt someones feelings
UpliftingNews,removed,you dont solve problems by not doing anything most of the time thats why this is a good thing to note its confusing that youre against pointing out these firsts yet agree with the message they are trying to send
UpliftingNews,removed,would not call her unattractive but she is probably the least beautiful beautypagent winner i have seen
UpliftingNews,removed,ive lived in missouri my entire life and this chick is like a
UpliftingNews,removed,in addition to lacquercritic about how pageants are about more than just plain appearances beauty in entirely and incredibly subjective thats why culture attitude intellgences charisma etc are judged not do i think shes hot or not
UpliftingNews,removed,the gay propaganda continues last time i checked we werent the ones stoning gays to death yet were subjected to the propaganda in our societies gay is cool abortion is fine says the nwo who wants to reduce the world population so they dont have to rub shoulders with us slaves
UpliftingNews,removed,missouri has way more attractive people than that
UpliftingNews,removed,omg who fucking cares if people want equal treatment we all need to stop fucking pretending like this shit matters its ridiculous you people are fucking retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,gay or not shes a bit of a hag
UpliftingNews,removed,first openly gay you fucking idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,lol it just keeps getting more retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont think miss contest are about beauty anymore i dont really know what they are about to be honest its almost always people of average intelligence and slightly above average beauty who get to answer dumb questions and do silly stuff to answer your question i think shes more likely to be cast as an evil stepmom rather than cinderella because of the nose you ask yes because of the nose
UpliftingNews,removed,so the real news would be if they had the first really fugly miss america contestant
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont care about of news stories about straight white men and yet im inundated with that shit constantly every fucking movie i see is about straight white men every fucking stand up comedian i go see is a straight white man the politicians i see are straight white men i have to see your shit all the time so calm down the world is made up of more than just you
UpliftingNews,removed,bah im a member of the lgbtq community but it is a bit irking that somebody this ugly would be a miss state then again it is missouri heh
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah because im sure if youre a straight girl from missouri or from the us at all in the wake of orland youre going to get on national television and tell everyone you are gay and keep the charade going and lie to all your friends and family that sounds about right
UpliftingNews,removed,versus death in florida or all of the thanks to aids ok
UpliftingNews,removed,faggot
UpliftingNews,removed,just because you dont find her attractive doesnt mean she doesnt fit into pageant beauty also most people would say she is attractive
UpliftingNews,removed,aaaand let the hategates open religion
UpliftingNews,removed,i think it celebrates how far weve come not very long ago this just wouldnt have happened an out lesbian woman being allowed into the competition never mind winning it and going on to represent america why ignore it
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry if it wasnt clear but i wasnt actually asking those questions i just put them forth generally as common questions people ask also itd be kinda strange to ask a woman about gay sex its cool that you both pay though although its kind of weird that we live in a society where thats not the norm for most couples thanks for the reply though it certainly does clear up what i asked and then some
UpliftingNews,removed,she doesnt look gay
UpliftingNews,removed,thats not a dike thats a bitch whos desperate for attention
UpliftingNews,removed,is she hot
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah she aint gonna win lookin like that
UpliftingNews,removed,when youre defined by your orientation for your entire life by society is it that surprising when they do the same
UpliftingNews,removed,what if she is saying that she loves the vag to become more popular and create a story behind it nobody gives a fuck if you are a guy that sucks dig or a chick that eats hair tacos get over it what you do behind bedroom doors should be private now hold my beer while i fuck a goat in the closet
UpliftingNews,removed,shes kinda fugly imo
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck off you piece of shit sjw nobody needs your fake bland positivity to mask everyones creative and sarcastic comments youre like the fucking care bear nobody wants to get a rainbow from
UpliftingNews,removed,that sounds like you want to just treat everyone equally and not make a huge deal over their very minor differences seems like reddit doesnt like that comment score
UpliftingNews,removed,hmm this stuff vs thedonald can we not have a middle ground
UpliftingNews,removed,i think it happens pretty infrequently though its played up a lot by the media
UpliftingNews,removed,i think you two are taking the same article in a different light half half full or empty absumo said because its still such a problem that people are celebrating when it finally happens so ab sees it and is sad about the fact we still have discrimination you said its just celebrating the steps that our society takes towards inclusion so you see the article and see the progress we are making away from bigotry
UpliftingNews,removed,im with you i thought it was just a bad angle nope
UpliftingNews,removed,who fucking cares
UpliftingNews,removed,does it really matter if shes gay i really dont care what people think theyre sexuality is i do have a problem with people who think theyre agender and shit like that
UpliftingNews,removed,shes ugly and looks forty
UpliftingNews,removed,clearly multiple thousands of peopleand probably a good portion of the lgbtq crowd
UpliftingNews,removed,shes just openly gay you idiot she doesnt hide it as a factor in her life but its not her whole identity
UpliftingNews,removed,come on that is one fugly woman i know lesbians hotter than that
UpliftingNews,removed,i never tried to turn it negative read what i said i was very clear nothing in what i said was against her the report or what it means the only reason i put unpopular opinion is because people dont read or try to understand they look at a few words fly off the handle and down vote and say things i didnt say typical reddit hive mind the issue is that it shouldnt still be an issue we as a species should be past a lot of issues by now the sadnesslament is that we arent past it yet by now read it again
UpliftingNews,removed,gender fluid lol what a joke
UpliftingNews,removed,white people genes

UpliftingNews,removed,i personally would have poisoned the food one less cancerous species on the planet make the planet great
UpliftingNews,removed,i assume others have said this already but let me pile on and say are you shitting me this is a miss america finalist we all know this contest is ridiculous in the year hell it has been irrelevant for years at this point anyone actually hot enough to model professionally has already been working since they were a teenager anyone really smart already has their scholarship and is studying researching whatever a middling attractive girl in a contest that no one cares about is a news item because she is gay the contest and being gay are both old hat who cares

UpliftingNews,removed,what a disgrace why is this uplifting they commit a crime and are being rewarded for it are you kidding me how about this they do their time and when they get out they try to college on their own and not get help from the state and if they commit another crime we just execute them thatll reduce the crime rate remove this shit from humanity and then give that pell grants to students who didnt violate the rights of other people
UpliftingNews,removed,lmao american schools have those does the teacher also teach with a gun in hand
UpliftingNews,removed,which one has down syndrome
UpliftingNews,removed,depressing news what idiot would let his normal child go to the same class retards do and what idiot would let his retarded child go to the same class normal children so this is awful for all of them the retarded kid will never so as good as he would in a special school while the normal children will be very significantly slowed down by him im sorry but thats the harsh truth there is nothing uplifting in this
UpliftingNews,removed,which begs the question what is normal

UpliftingNews,removed,httplmgtfycomqhowdoweknowplasticbeerringsendupintheoceanedible
UpliftingNews,removed,lol disagreeing with you year old also you cant say in the vast majority of cases because thats bullshit its always a case by case basis and you dont even know the individual details of this case that being the case youre one of those types of people who thinks being cynical and seeing past the warm fuzzy feelings makes you superior why else would you lord your sanctimonious attitude of knowing better than apparently everyone actually involved in the case without realising the news story may not even be giving the full picture or that the committee took his level of disability into account when deciding he was eligible for mainstream
UpliftingNews,removed,rthathappened
UpliftingNews,removed,what a dumb waste of your time to type that out
UpliftingNews,removed,this subreddit is full of fucking morons

UpliftingNews,removed,you can take a n out the streets but not the streets out the n
UpliftingNews,removed,not only are they not stopped but theyre given an actual market to sell their tickets stubhub etc oh no theyre reselling tickets how dare they its called supply and demand you entitled whiny little babies if theres anything youre going to complain about when it comes to ticket sellers its the scammers who sell fakeinvalid tickets not the scalpers selling perfectly legitimate ones
UpliftingNews,removed,unless he found people buying in blocks refunded them and made the sales physical tickets thus harder to rescalp as people keep bringing up then no profit if anything they took a loss on these due to tmv
UpliftingNews,removed,paper tickets are harder to do this with which is what he made them into and see my comment above for why they may have taken a loss not profited the first time around
UpliftingNews,removed,lol you must have bad reading comprehension he didnt buy the tickets back

UpliftingNews,removed,are you really sure you needed to paraphrase your comment with a tldr
UpliftingNews,removed,tldr cats would outlive cats if humans vanished from earth
UpliftingNews,removed,i wouldnt doubt it i heard from some podcast or somewhere that when a cat licks you when youre sleeping its to check if youre alive because theyd apparently eat you if you were dead there has been cases too where a cats owner dies and nobody finds out so the cat gets hungry and starts to eat the corpse
UpliftingNews,removed,you starved your cat for weeks or what
UpliftingNews,removed,four handsome young skateboarders get a medal for saving a woman from rape theyre going to be drowning in pussy girls that age love the whole bad boy with a heart of gold shtick its almost ironic

UpliftingNews,removed,how does anyone find this uplifting they know what was going to happen let it happen then went back sure they stopped him from getting away but they didnt stop him jesus fuck you liberals are so pc with your heads so far up your asses
UpliftingNews,removed,sympathising with someone who molests kids christ you really get all kinds on reddit
UpliftingNews,removed,she didnt pass out behind the dumpster he brought her behind the dumpster to fuck her and ran away leaving her bloody and covered in dirt when witnesses arrived

UpliftingNews,removed,thats fucking weird notice like most of the rest of the world doesnt do that smelly indian lol how could anyone get us brown people mixed up omg you all look the same
UpliftingNews,removed,imagine how perfect she would have been
UpliftingNews,removed,quit being so delusional for the sake of political correctness the fact of the matter is the genetic variety of whites is far wider than that of indians have you ever seen an indian with naturally blonde hair light brown hair red hair freckles no because of this certain traits are associated by region hence the fairly easy ability to tell the difference between an italian and an irish and a german but on a form they fill out white sorry to burst your bubble but there is hardly any genetic variety of this sort in the middle east or india hence the easy confusion between the two racial groups complained about above
UpliftingNews,removed,what you consider as a moral standpoint is not the same for others and for your information just because two people get married doesnt mean they are having sex
UpliftingNews,removed,its not all rainbows and fairytales like so many people including myself make it out to be im happily divorced marriage is not for everyone

UpliftingNews,removed,your name is wellsuited to you why are you so angry about someone being skeptical of private land owners it wasnt so long ago that monarchs and other leaders with absolute power considered all land within their borders theirs and that anyone who owned a tract of land was merely borrowing it as it is eminent domain exists as a relic of that basically that the needs of the people outweigh any private claim theres absolutely nothing wrong with being skeptical of private ownership because no one person or entity should be responsible for preserving land that is a responsibility of the public where the entity being the government is under the oversight of everyone
UpliftingNews,removed,how is there no oa reference yet

UpliftingNews,removed,so he basically made useless all the low skills workers who often would go to homelessness without their job

UpliftingNews,removed,because terrorists are humans too they are also more human than canadians btw
UpliftingNews,removed,kid got pushed over what we should see is him brushing himself off and getting back up not acting like a three year old
UpliftingNews,removed,absolutely disgusting down with refugees
UpliftingNews,removed,right right wing people alt right edgy meme teens who have no idea about politics and only want to offend everyone so they will look cool the left is using them as controlled opposition just imagine one of the clinton interns made one post about one thing the edgy kids would make great noise post offensive content and the left could claim that these altright trump extremists are literally hitler look at historical use of this hitlers men got a mentally ill hobo to sneak into the reichstag and set his coat on fire the other guys just set the whole building on fire then blamed it on the one communist idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,i still have hopes for the dodo
UpliftingNews,removed,why does he waste is time with something like that he should enjoy his last weeksmonthswhatever

UpliftingNews,removed,as a mixed race person im finding it hard to play victim the dad did right his daughter hit and got told to grow the fuck up then she turns round and states because her partners black its funny the dad even states its not his preference for his daughter to be with a black man but that doesnt seem like hes disowned her if i had a child id prefer them to be with x person whether they would be would be out of my control the statement reads as i am my parents have chosen to no longer support my future stripping me of all my resources including my personal savings my car my phone and my education and leaving me on my own to pay for college unfortunately i will no longer be able to attend college if i cannot come up with the money somehow ive applied and received some scholarship money through financial aid including grants loans and workstudy but i still need at least to cover the first year of my remaining out of pocket tuition for college by may another race baiting bullshit story
UpliftingNews,removed,he has a case of cuckface and shes too hot for him maybe the experience she wont forget was the homeless guy dicking her down at their place
UpliftingNews,removed,the person in the story at the link above is thought to have created a false narrative about her parents for her own personal profit we dont have any proof of this it is just speculation based on the article itself people are offering anecdotal stories of people with legitimately held beliefs which are totally and completely baseless the girl might actually believe that her parents cut her off due to her black boyfriend just like the person mentioned it could also be because she is ungrateful and needs to get a job we dont know the relevance is a loose connection to the topic offering unsourced uncited stories in support of one of the two ideas about the article in the link if you dont want to read it scroll down or click something else more than a few of us like to read them that is why it has upvotes
UpliftingNews,removed,okay now we know youre lying there arent any union jobs left who has some pitchforks
UpliftingNews,removed,my parents cut me off at and i got a job i imagine thats how it went for most people this girl decided to play victim and beg strangers for money while supporting a racist narrative she still hasnt learned how to take care of herself just to manipulate people its not uplifting its infuriating this little princess needs to learn responsibility
UpliftingNews,removed,if it looks and sounds like propaganda
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont know that i would consider it normal in most cases i expect parents allow their adult children to live with them if they have a job are in school saving up for a house downpayment or otherwise have a future plan they are working towards no parent wants their kids to fail but those kids have to step up especially if they are legally adults on the opposite side there will be some who havent quite gotten into the mentality of being an adult and responsible for your own bills if you want to eat buy your own food if you want to drive buy your own car if you want to read buy your own book you need a job with that said you can also see that her parents havent thrown her out she is still allowed to live with them the most likely reasoning here is to motivate her to get a job and figure out what she is going to do with her life if she doesnt have their money to spend she will find out how hard it is to survive without a solid education and good job
UpliftingNews,removed,go ahead and downvote me because i dont agree with handouts like this her parents have chosen to no longer support future ok so now shes like a normal teenager who has parents that treat her like an adult so she goes to strangers to ensure her future is taken care of i paid for my college my car etc so do tons and tons of year olds sorry that it happened over race but its not like they took everything she had and dumped her in the sahara to die she still lives at home with her parents but instead of finding a way to fix this on her own she goes to the internet to ask for money she doesnt have transportation ok but there is public transportation in memphis that tons of people use it sucks but she needs to find a way to make it work without holding up the cant work please spare change sign online
UpliftingNews,removed,uthickfaces cuckold crying name calling leftie attitude is why trump won
UpliftingNews,removed,attention to the details is key so eager to throw your children out at she is still allowed to live with them according to her own quoted words in the original article imagine having support from your parents throughout your life the article doesnt contain enough damning information against the parents to support that taken together including the fact she is still allowed to live with them to the quote from the father about it being about secrecy it supports the idea of parents trying to motivate their adult child to focus on school instead of a boyfriend they are drawing a line in the sand that line includes her supporting her own lifestyle she chose to do that by publicly burning her parents instead of getting a job
UpliftingNews,removed,unlike obama and his partner with their daughters
UpliftingNews,removed,for this kenyan war criminal called obongo
UpliftingNews,removed,its probably because since the dawn of man genetics have mattered and you are a brainwashed whore that watches jew controlled media like supergirl and jessica jones and fuck beasts to try to show the world how progressive you are hippies wore tye die and didnt shower to be counter culture you are ruining you genetic line to look like you are hip you disgusting freak

UpliftingNews,removed,any reasonable person doesnt want some mongrel in the family tree your ancestors fought tooth and nail for your people and you go muddy up everything they fought for because jews that control media told you to everyone clap for the brainwashed goyim dumb cunts
UpliftingNews,removed,to donald trump jr eric and ivanka go fuck yourself sasha and malia
UpliftingNews,removed,white girl using a black savage to upset her father and gain attention welcome to the age of super girl where jew controlled media pushes race mixing on white women
UpliftingNews,removed,its interesting though seems a lot like a cash in on the current easy to leverage emotions of disgruntled voters but i guess thats what politics are
UpliftingNews,removed,im talking about your expresident bush is just as criminal as obongo but at least hes not a monkey
UpliftingNews,removed,this will haunt her for the rest of her life no white man of value wants a used up coal burning mud shark she threw away her future because jews in media push stupid shit like super girl jews make all white men nerdy dorks in their produced commercials and shows and make the strong black man fuck the white girl you people are trash for falling for it all
UpliftingNews,removed,if youre and cant figure out how to buy alcohol you really arent an adult yet what are you going to do when you need weed coke or something else in college get your shit together you need to learn
UpliftingNews,removed,so cool that they took time away from their monthly abortion visit to pen a letter
UpliftingNews,removed,smoking weed doing blow wearing laggy shit acting like black trash internet lull fucking black trash fucking animals pedophilia is cool
UpliftingNews,removed,by fucking a black guy she is holding herself back no man of value is going to marry a woman that bedded beasts you let jew media control your mind enjoy your super girl
UpliftingNews,removed,dead serious you really think white people want to make shows and commercials showing white women having sex with low iq beasts how do you think the west became great it was keeping these savage genetics away from ours the jew that founded the eu said he wanted to push black blood into europe to be able to control it better and destroy national pride any man of value will drop your ass if he finds out you bedded beasts
UpliftingNews,removed,and hippies were the first generation subverted start paying attention to how white men are portrayed in commercials and majority of shows as quirky beta males you dumb brainwashed whores are destroying the bloodline the innovated of the new world look around your room and start google the inventor of everything in it you are brainwashed trash and deserve to be trashed once these dumb whores are done fucking animals and try to find a man with value any guy with a shred of self worth is going to drop them like shitted diaper no one wants some nasty cunt who fucks beasts enjoy your super girl you sickos
UpliftingNews,removed,it doesnt matter you are still destroying your bloodline and the innovators of the world you live in start choosing things in your room and google the inventor you are throwing your genetic value into the third world have fun
UpliftingNews,removed,because maybe potheads actually do something of value and not just be a resource eating waste of meat waiting to die
UpliftingNews,removed,the parents cut her off from her i doubt that is entirely true as presented the more likely case is that they took back access to a car they had purchased and allowed her to conditionally use the same is true of a phone on a phone plan paid for by her parents they purchased the device on their credit paid the monthly charges and allowed her conditional use of the device they paid for it it is their property and they revoked conditional use of it even if she took them to court they legally own all of the property in question it is not hers this is what sticks out the most for me i cant speak to savings but we have already cast serious doubt on the claims of racism by her parents their stripping me of all my resources as she claims and more if those claims dont hold up well the rest are just as questionable until proven otherwise luckily for her that isnt a condition of collecting her gofundme money that is securely hers not telling the parents about a boyfriend isnt lying to them its her private life they can be interested but they have no right to know who shes dating or if that was meant to be in her parents view it is important to keep things consistent so it makes sense there is a lot here to digest in my personal view her parents can ask anything they want to ask she is free to refuse to answer and they are free to cut off financial support as a result they dont owe her a free car free phone and free lifestyle after she is legally an adult that is conditionally offered based entirely on what they want to do with the money they worked for and earned if they no longer want to spend it on her that is their legal right that is the benefit of working for and earning your own money you dont answer to anyone else you earned your place so it doesnt depend on someone approving or disapproving until youre figured because someone disapproves of you you do get unemployment though
UpliftingNews,removed,honey is beautiful because it doesnt look like brown shit go back to the jungle
UpliftingNews,removed,blacks have no in group loyalty you are a scavengers its in your african blood you run from your people and anyone of you that makes it try to fuck another race you run from your people imagine if any black person who gained some success stayed within the black community and put their money buying from black business and creating black business blacks hate blacks more than anyone else and its because you know you are trash its why you try to fuck anything not black no loyalty animals

UpliftingNews,removed,the story is bullshit it literally contradicts itself reporting reality vs the gofundme page narrative
UpliftingNews,removed,oh you poor brainwashed fool mixing with a black person ruins your genetics makes you more impulsive aggressive and dumber we are all related because we all trace back to a single common ancestor if you go back far enough were all related to a monkey whats your point of whites have no black ancestry whatsoever httpwwwunzcomistevenytwhiteblackamurkydistinctiongrowsstillmurkier of whites have no african ancestry there was minimal gene flow between archaic europeans and asians human intelligence is highly heritable scientific consensus is that iq tests are not racially biased very poor whites are comparably intelligent to very wealthy blacks privately intelligence experts hold more hereditarian views than they express in public black children raised in white households have similar iqs to black children in black households the average african iq is estimated at the average africanamerican iq is compared to the average white iq of genes for large brains linked to high iq are common everywhere except africa intelligence has a genetic basis iq scores are the best predictor of success in western society

UpliftingNews,removed,no and if they do its their own fault they would either have had insurance which would cap way lower than that or they refused to accept public assistance which again is their own fault in addition to that the hospital would give them a substantially smaller bill if they didnt have coverage in the hope of getting any money at all
UpliftingNews,removed,the comment you responded to was entirely civilized retard
UpliftingNews,removed,you must be special needs im sorry
UpliftingNews,removed,who cares what these inbred hillbillies think
UpliftingNews,removed,that baby is going to be retarded as fuck though
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry but this absolutely is an example of fucking awful parenting it is actually disgusting you used read an important text as an excusable situation for a parent to lose track of their child even if momentarily not only that this was minutes how little of a clue did they have that it took this long to even find their toddler again your username is utterly terrifying considering your awful philosophy on toddler supervision events like this are how parents lose their children because it is considered gross negligence or child endangerment this was absolutely bad parenting
UpliftingNews,removed,im going to try my best to make this response not break rule but as a parent you no longer get to have luxuries such as being fully engrossed in a conversation for minutes when you have children you give up your life for theirs life isnt about making sure your happiness and needs are met now its about making sure your childs need and happiness are met once theyre older you get that freedom back but until then
UpliftingNews,removed,are you already wow time flies

UpliftingNews,removed,strange thing to ask a waiter heres now fly my girlfriend and newborn baby home

UpliftingNews,removed,you cant just say this for everyone i mean even now is already one of the worst years for someone who say lost a daughter or a son to someone murdering them i hate generalized statements each person can only say if the year was good for themselves or not
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont think so i think the point is clear they are generalizing when something like this is based on personal experiences more than overall
UpliftingNews,removed,arent there still people to save who cares about some dogs when theres still human lives at stake goddamn media
UpliftingNews,removed,message of trump

UpliftingNews,removed,sorry for being such a killjoy but the other puppies are dead
UpliftingNews,removed,sismologists were not sued for not predicting an earthquake stop now spreading this false piece of news inform yourself and wash your mouth before speaking again about italy
UpliftingNews,removed,it gives me great comfort knowing the puppies are safe now how many people died forgive me if this sounds crass but given my upbringing with a deadbeat father and depressive mother i find it hard relating to real humans and think its great that the puppies like me no matter what
UpliftingNews,removed,really
UpliftingNews,removed,care to read the article and find out
UpliftingNews,removed,this was neat now its just irritating
UpliftingNews,removed,probably didnt major in womens studies
UpliftingNews,removed,your personal attacks and hyperboles aside i still think that when assessing a risk of an illness it matters a lot if an illness will kill you in years or you are talking as if i am advocating giving people infected blood when in reality all i am saying that illness outcome should be taken into account when judging the risks
UpliftingNews,removed,you dont know how much i spend in charity or what i do to help others what gives you the right to judge me go grow up dude
UpliftingNews,removed,in what chemistry when hes done raping his niece hell be off with his son with some kitty litter into the garage

UpliftingNews,removed,i bet it isnt you self identify as an attack helicopter
UpliftingNews,removed,rule dont be unattractive
UpliftingNews,removed,free college you say thats so cool i wish we could be more like iran free college executingjailing people for being gay a culture where women are not equal with men not being able to speak your mind out of fear of disappearing and much more iran is hella cool
UpliftingNews,removed,i cant help but notice that many of the statistics mentioned in the comments here are not very useful in ascertaining whether or not gay men actually pose a credible risk to the blood supply the percentage of infections is higher among gay men this isnt in question nor is the fact that the percentage of new infections is also higher among gay men however it also strikes me as an important question to ask whether gay males also have a higher likelihood of being untested or having an unknown status as posters here have made very clear no test is every gay guy i know gets tested pretty frequently usually around every three months or so none of the heterosexual people i know get tested with any frequency at all afaik blood donation is how all the straight people i have heard of having hiv have found out it strikes me as an important question because the percentage of the gay population that has hiv is already not donating blood because none of them are psychotic assholes the populations that matter are exactly the populations who have hiv and dont know and the percent likelihood that any given donor is within those pools the ban notwithstanding so how likely is it that a gay man who doesnt know he has hiv walks in to donate blood
UpliftingNews,removed,free unless you dont fit the profile then you are barred from going to school at least the ones who are fortunate enough to go to college dont have to pay though
UpliftingNews,removed,gays are massively promiscuous its part of what makes them so disgusting

UpliftingNews,removed,yeah ya know cause you cant lie on the screening questionnaire or anything needle using homosexual whores dont lie on questionnaires you are stereotyping and that is wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,k
UpliftingNews,removed,we have but one rule dont be a dick
UpliftingNews,removed,k
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting why do i care am i supposed to upvote a thread with the title year old finnish woman receives doctorate degree
UpliftingNews,removed,thats the isis college right
UpliftingNews,removed,think about it the type of behavior they have leads to a higher likelihood of getting infected so if a straight guy cheats on his wife with a woman he has a lower chance of getting it than if a gay guy cheats on his partner
UpliftingNews,removed,dont let of bad muslims ruin it for all this man is the good muslim

UpliftingNews,removed,thats true but they are making good progress with optogenetics to cure addiction still not on humans though and i dont know if it ever will be possible to use optogenetics in humans but the good news is that they are now reverse engineering the information they found with optogenetics so they can do it with dbs science
UpliftingNews,removed,her kid her property let natural selection work
UpliftingNews,removed,but when there are endless piles of anecdotal evidence it cannot be ignored its not a one size fits all solution
UpliftingNews,removed,are you fucking retarded if the states didnt have some kind of decentralized power there would be no colorado to flee to you absolute fucking idiot how you can put this on the altright is beyond me you ignorant piece of garbage
UpliftingNews,removed,you can get high on thc natural cannabis is only thc anyways those behemoths they sell at the shops are completely mans creation

UpliftingNews,removed,well suit yourself most people see that very different if you dont donate dont expect a donation though which is fine
UpliftingNews,removed,i never called you an asshole you said if youre an organ donor then medical facilities will be quick to let you die this is complete nonsense but it has nothing to do with whether youre an asshole of course it would be great if we had technology that made organ donation obsolete but we fucking dont right now grow up develop thicker skin and some reading comprehension ability and enjoy your downvotes in the meantime
UpliftingNews,removed,read your first sentence and thought youre an idiot thats as far as we will discuss things
UpliftingNews,removed,oh yeah i heard about this didnt he later get a gay cat who then ate his syphilitic parakeet

UpliftingNews,removed,really ive always heard that canadians are a lot stupider and a lot less friendly than everyone assumes can i ask why you choose to be such a dumb cunt
UpliftingNews,removed,i didnt post until i saw how truly ironic it was and it wasnt out of my way youre not that special i was here already that is how i saw your comment the first time i was reading the comments on a subreddit i am subscribed to thats kinda what subscriptions are for

UpliftingNews,removed,woofully underrated comment
UpliftingNews,removed,you always hear about young folks doing incidental things like this as if their age somehow makes them betteratthings years old who gives a shit you never read year old solves the constipation problem or year old is responsible for the equation that helped spacex land their new thingy good job kid you were born in you have no idea what the world was like before and youll never get to be in the cockpit of a commercial plane while its in flight get bent
UpliftingNews,removed,that wont stand in the way of all the jingoistic yanks wholl wank themselves into a torpor over this
UpliftingNews,removed,so an economic system caused authoritarianism really if whatever economic system a government is using is to blame for the human rights situation capitalism has the worst track record in history with central america in the and most of africa
UpliftingNews,removed,but dogs
UpliftingNews,removed,are you saying the dog made this whole thing up
UpliftingNews,removed,more bullshit than year old me could write if i had to produce a storey on the sas
UpliftingNews,removed,auuuugh this is such a nice story but why wasnt the lady who actually did the thing interviewed and why was this the reason she she knew how to do the blatantly obvious thing well she has a couple of kids of her own and i guess that motherly instinct mustve kicked in mericuuuuh cmoooon surely we can do uplifting stories without a side serving of gender stereotyping
UpliftingNews,removed,this on the other hand is welldocumented the truth the cover story httpwwweliteukforcesinfospecialairservicesasoperationsbasraraid
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder if ops wife cried at this too
UpliftingNews,removed,instead of giving money go vote these fuckers out of office
UpliftingNews,removed,a part time trucker dont work yourself to death man
UpliftingNews,removed,heres a toaster typically you dont want to rely on just one piece of equipment if its essential to your revenue stream if it breaks down youre sol so its usually wise to have two of the same units ergo in toasters
UpliftingNews,removed,holy shit i hate dipshit murica but i loved this puff piece i want a dog like him and some country bumpkin of a woman to devote her life to dogs like him awes im all about the feels
UpliftingNews,removed,lets face it the guy probably isnt well educated when it comes to finances and will likely piss the money away for essentially doing nothing hes buying shit he cant usually afford hes not investing it in his childrens education
UpliftingNews,removed,and here in america we dont call them out we elect them as the democratic nominee
UpliftingNews,removed,thats lame the rich should be taxed less cause they earned their money
UpliftingNews,removed,what a waste of money
UpliftingNews,removed,then what is the rationale behind tax cuts for the rich
UpliftingNews,removed,not all copies are bad just a reminder
UpliftingNews,removed,must be a trump supporter

UpliftingNews,removed,bringing them as refugees here is condescending stupid policy bringing in refugees has a lot of problems and should not be a solution i am not being a bigot i respect them but there needs to be a solution where this guy can happily stay in his country and all of us can stay happily in ours only solution i see is total rejection of useless wars
UpliftingNews,removed,keep shoving that pro muslim propaganda down peoples throats
UpliftingNews,removed,yo this comment thread is gonna be lit

UpliftingNews,removed,heartwarming until one kills the innocent little kid playing down the street happy for the dog though
UpliftingNews,removed,thats nice it would be even nicer if cops didnt shoot hundreds of dogs each year
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont know if its the norm but it happens with enough frequency in enough cases with enough reckless disregard for life and property that they deserve to be shamed
UpliftingNews,removed,do you eat animals
UpliftingNews,removed,pit bulls abuse little kids when theyre left alone with them dont adopt any just let them be put to sleep
UpliftingNews,removed,the dog is like lucky im not black
UpliftingNews,removed,kill thousands of dogs save one round of applause
UpliftingNews,removed,surprised they didnt shot it on sight
UpliftingNews,removed,damn cops rescues a dog and the whole world knows about it people rescue animals all the time but you dont hear about it what make cops so special that they are praised for shit they should be doing in the first place bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,so the only time police wont kill a dog is when it is evidence used to jail someone
UpliftingNews,removed,good start now i hope to see black people saved from abuse treated the same way
UpliftingNews,removed,better grab my tartar sauce

UpliftingNews,removed,sweet sentiments and all but im not going to suddenly go out of my way for everyone just because some kid is dying sorry thats just the truth good luck becca
UpliftingNews,removed,easy to say when you dont gotta live through people being assholes
UpliftingNews,removed,god who cares
UpliftingNews,removed,like im going to let some cancer kid tell me what to do
UpliftingNews,removed,i thought it said aids
UpliftingNews,removed,this isnt uplifting at all
UpliftingNews,removed,and ive officially lost any faith i had left in humanity thanks to the replies in this thread
UpliftingNews,removed,rupliftingnews tends to have a remarkably downpulling user base its ok for what its worth i upvoted you which probably isnt much because you know internet points
UpliftingNews,removed,soon she will be dead and her soul will be uplifted into heaven 🌈
UpliftingNews,removed,be terminally ill with cancer ill pass
UpliftingNews,removed,truth is it really doesnt matter how you treat people they will always treat you however they want karma is a lie cut and dry

UpliftingNews,removed,dont tell me what to do becca
UpliftingNews,removed,this isnt uplifting god damn you are a fucking asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,this happens so fucking often in this sub i am actually close to unsubbing i dont want some dramatic sweeping against all odds stuff when it puts horror and apocalypse in my face at the same time sure do stuff about helping ill people and all that jazz its awesome but i dont want to feel like i visit a death ward every day
UpliftingNews,removed,pffff no
UpliftingNews,removed,your comment was removed but its the truth this subreddit is not uplifting as it used to be its supposed to be like good news but its always like ugh
UpliftingNews,removed,this isnt uplifting at all
UpliftingNews,removed,grandpa dancing barefoot on the carpet again
UpliftingNews,removed,i built an android app last month which suggests acts of kindness is anyone is stuck for ideas httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcommillionaokmillionactsofkindness
UpliftingNews,removed,you know why this subreddit fucking sucks because practically every story tries to bring you down right before uplifting you
UpliftingNews,removed,why bother youll just die of cancer anyway may as well be mean to everyone who gives a shit
UpliftingNews,removed,oh a hashtag how original she will certainly be remembered by all
UpliftingNews,removed,people are cynical because theres nothing positive about cancer and those who are gushing how inspiring this is are just spinning a shit situation you people really think this kid will inspire the world no shes gonna die in horrible pain and all of those who said she inspired them will throw some money at a charity and go back to their lives all those who say different have never had to deal with cancer
UpliftingNews,removed,these cancer patients always come off as entitled to me
UpliftingNews,removed,like your overprotective mother you nasty hipster slut cunt
UpliftingNews,removed,she
UpliftingNews,removed,shut up bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,when was the last post fromt his sub to reach the front page that wasnt at least bad news but with a slightly uplifting result cant we ever get a strait up good news across the board story
UpliftingNews,removed,these types have tended to seek out news and media outlets to push the story of their quintessential struggle on everybody whether they want to hear it or not its not that i dont care its that this type of thing shouldnt be getting a spotlight when there are far more important and notable things out there
UpliftingNews,removed,because a girl dying of cancer isnt uplifting no matter how you spin it this article is just a reminder that there is no justice in the world and that bad things happen to good people

UpliftingNews,removed,meh if i had sex with horses would i get the same praise doubt it everyones different shut up move on
UpliftingNews,removed,fucking fag
UpliftingNews,removed,transgender is a mental illness police officers are to serve and protect the public which concerns me in some ways im concerned for their police service obviously i have no issue personally but facts are facts do i believe theoretically a trans gender police officer could perform better then a normal police officer yes yes i do still doesnt change the facts i think police officers should be evaluated psychiatrically frequently we wouldnt have so many unqualifiedoutoftheordinary police officers then also would cut down of unjustified police killings drug activity you overempathetic bias egofilled humans need to realize that it isnt an attack of being different it is literally is a mental illness shall we break out the psychology and science behind this thats what i thought you are either have a penis or vagina and rarely both or neither not one to the other i believe only the smartest dedicated sane people should control the law i also do not think small woman should be on the beat squad fighting dudes im all for equality but jesus people when does reality kick in not everyone can do everything
UpliftingNews,removed,this is not uplifting encouraging other peoples mental illness is not a positive thing
UpliftingNews,removed,hes not stupid it really is a mental illness
UpliftingNews,removed,i wouldnt like a sexually confused pervert policing me call my crazy
UpliftingNews,removed,i have no horse in this race but it really does seem like delusional people are trying to create their own version of reality
UpliftingNews,removed,misspelled her
UpliftingNews,removed,but then you lose the controversy
UpliftingNews,removed,because seattle try this in the bible belt
UpliftingNews,removed,there are plenty of people with medical degrees saying otherwise
UpliftingNews,removed,being a cunt to someone with a different mindset isnt very uplifting of you how about we all shut up and allow others to have opinions as long as they arent bothering others
UpliftingNews,removed,hurrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
UpliftingNews,removed,holy shit i just got triggered by your comment put a trigger warning on that right now
UpliftingNews,removed,if you identify as a man but have two x chromosomes i am sorry but you are a woman period shes nothing more than a bulldyke thats butchered her body
UpliftingNews,removed,so uplifting who wouldve thought the pacific northwest would be so liberal oh wait everyone
UpliftingNews,removed,because being a police officer is not devoting ones life to the saftey of the people thats fantasy bs
UpliftingNews,removed,its not made available but advertised as narrative enforcer
UpliftingNews,removed,if that used to be a woman well that used to be a huge mistake
UpliftingNews,removed,last thing we all need is to hire mentally ill people to be police officers
UpliftingNews,removed,great now we have menially ill people with guns
UpliftingNews,removed,the pigs serve no purpose but to enforce the will of the bourgeoisie not joking they do not protect the pigs murder citizens daily they exist to stop class revolt and only that reason it doesnt matter what they think theyre doing or why they think theyre doing it but thats the material action defense of private business and property
UpliftingNews,removed,and this is why nobody takes liberals seriously you felt the need to tell somebody such a pointless thing because you were offended by such a pointless thing
UpliftingNews,removed,you sound a little triggered right now
UpliftingNews,removed,i wasnt offended i pointed it out in hopes that youd see the stupidity of your actions i guess i was wrong carry on careful getting off your horse
UpliftingNews,removed,its stupidity it would be like getting triggered over somebody saying blackswhites instead of black peoplewhite people its looking for an excuse to be a victim
UpliftingNews,removed,said the authoritarian fool
UpliftingNews,removed,libtard propaganda
UpliftingNews,removed,its almost as if the antilgbt rhetoric the left is goping on about is is just a fairy tale most people just dont care about what other people are doing in general let alone in bed its just a few fringe politicians like obama when he opposed gay marriage or hillaary when she did and a few wako religious types and none of these nutballs are representative of the population at large they just get lots of attention jesus even trump loves lgbt people and will fight for them more than obama ever did and hes supposed to be hitler but really the antilgbt thing is just fake news just like the everyone is racist bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,born with a vagina but im a man baby
UpliftingNews,removed,until he kills a black man
UpliftingNews,removed,thought this was supposed to be uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,who cares the old whore will be dead soon
UpliftingNews,removed,seattle is so cucked its disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,and then you used your hydraulic pump to inflate your clitoris that they stuck on a piece of flesh cut from your thigh and you raped them in the ass after which you psychologically redressed them and used your hypnotic ability to make them forget you even talked to them this isnt rthathappened
UpliftingNews,removed,weve gone from weird and ostracized to accepted can people stop being all transgender up in my face now i get it its cool ill call you whatever you want just leave me alone
UpliftingNews,removed,so triggered let me tell you all about it i woke up and my shadow scared me then i went outside and some cis white scum dared to verbally rape me and talk to me about how nice my blue hair is o em gee i was so triggered then he had the audacity to say transgendered instead of transgendered person might as well have killed me s
UpliftingNews,removed,he should be met with support and acceptance to see a therapist
UpliftingNews,removed,people treat person like a person news
UpliftingNews,removed,wont this change if laws restricting the mentally ill from possessing firearms pass
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean her peers
UpliftingNews,removed,people with mental illnesses need to be locked up
UpliftingNews,removed,k victim
UpliftingNews,removed,i have no ego i just happen to be right
UpliftingNews,removed,we should stop normalizing this mental illness
UpliftingNews,removed,police are authorized to use deadly force when the situation calls for it i dont want that responsibility in the hands of someone with a mental illness its called common sense theres no disrespect here only concern for the well being of this officers community and youre right at least on one point this sense doesnt seem to be too common this shouldnt be posted in rupliftingnews this is a sad day for america
UpliftingNews,removed,having exposure to genders is correct in speech so having exposure to transgenders would be correct too as a nontrans person i dont appreciate the microaggression you should check your privilege a word shouldnt be treated different because it is trans
UpliftingNews,removed,trans people dont get to decide that legitimately used words bother them cry to your psychiatrist
UpliftingNews,removed,because its a mental illness and you are in a job that attracts people with mental illness
UpliftingNews,removed,hell be assassinated within a year
UpliftingNews,removed,lol not news
UpliftingNews,removed,looks like you love playing games of semantics if you are transgender and dont have gender dysphoria then you are literally nothing more than a cross dresser
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont give a fuck what people do to themselves but being a tranny is being mentally ill
UpliftingNews,removed,i would really prefer if you called me an attack helicopterperson its really dehumanizing to be called an attack helicopter just because i identify as having a propeller sticking out my head
UpliftingNews,removed,ie mentally ill
UpliftingNews,removed,people who think certain limbs dont belong are perfectly happy cutting them off yet we call that a mental illness
UpliftingNews,removed,wont be such a big difference seeing as hes mentally ill hell fit right in
UpliftingNews,removed,they are the opposite of the pronoun theyre currently using so when it says he its really she
UpliftingNews,removed,nah that person is wrong the cop is biologically female but identifies as a man transactivists for some reason really want to refer to people by the sex they prefer rather than the sex they actually are sex cannot be changed
UpliftingNews,removed,boys have a penis gorls have a vagina boys who cut off their genitals are called eunuchs
UpliftingNews,removed,and sadly others are uplifted by perversion and the slow erosion of civilization
UpliftingNews,removed,uhhh
UpliftingNews,removed,so you also think telling fat people they should be at a healthy weight is a bad thing do you just want to live in a safespace where youre told harmful lifestyles are ok despite the obvious health risks of those lifestyles
UpliftingNews,removed,wow thats one ugly chick 🐥
UpliftingNews,removed,that first picture is a photo shoot where believe it or not goes through postproduction with photoshop yes there is something very offsetting about that it just looks so unnatural like you stuck a man and woman through a meat wringer and thats came out
UpliftingNews,removed,what about the bias where you ignore statistics and assume that if you dont know someones background then they are transgender oh theres plenty of transgenders you just dont notice them yeah this is bullshit and completely unfounded transgenders are a fad they will always be less than of the population we can over represent them and under represent them but this will literally never change
UpliftingNews,removed,so does he has a peepee or a vaginar
UpliftingNews,removed,sometimes obese people need to here the blunt truth without it being sugarcoated because otherwise they may try to eat it

UpliftingNews,removed,thank god the adults are back in government
UpliftingNews,removed,no such thing as transgender just mental illness just what we need more mentally ill pigs running around with guns
UpliftingNews,removed,lets see what anyone against this dude has to say when theyre held up at gunpoint and this fellow comes and saves the day
UpliftingNews,removed,who fucking cares
UpliftingNews,removed,gender reassignment has been around since the and has never been an issue until know i am with you in the who the fuck cares camp
UpliftingNews,removed,openly employing a mentally ill cop thats a great idea
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe you should stop expecting people to conform to your mental illness society isnt expected to pretend to hear the voices that schizophrenic people hear why should i have to pretend like youre a woman when everybody knows youre actually a man
UpliftingNews,removed,and the next step after that will be to treat schizophrenic people as if they are normal
UpliftingNews,removed,i wouldnt want someone mentally ill being a cop tbh
UpliftingNews,removed,but im totally down with the blacks and the gays although weirdly enough it works for religion jews muslims christians
UpliftingNews,removed,give this man a raise
UpliftingNews,removed,cutting your penis off is wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,of course i wanna be the firstblah blah blah nobody actually cares if you are gay bi or tranny black white mexican asian whatever this is some first world problems shit right here
UpliftingNews,removed,loser
UpliftingNews,removed,ewww
UpliftingNews,removed,trans people are mentally ill
UpliftingNews,removed,white privilege
UpliftingNews,removed,tattoos are obviously different than chopping your penis in half then turning it inside out
UpliftingNews,removed,a woman who was born with male genitals god youre delusional youre not a woman and you will never be
UpliftingNews,removed,their poor judgment will lead to them being a poor cop
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe he should meet a psychiatrist
UpliftingNews,removed,shes very brave
UpliftingNews,removed,all of you on here make me sick why couldnt we just teach people to be happy with who they actually are with bodies that are unmutilated the way they were born im so happy that at least they will never really ever be able to be truly satisfied they can get all the surgery and hormone therapy they want they will never really ever be the opposite of the gender they were born im glad that at least most people in the real world that arnt unemployed sitting in their mothers basements raging on the internet feel differently and at the end of the day it is still a mental disease i feel pity for those that believe that self mutilation is the only path to self confidence and i hope you are able to become happy with who you were born to be and actually are
UpliftingNews,removed,ok what just because you cant accept tips working at home depot know kids who work there doesnt mean people dont give you little shit
UpliftingNews,removed,you are completely wrong i stated at the end that the individuals stated they felt that way ill repeat i never gave my opinion i really dont like arguing with idiots so youll understand if i dont respond after this comment

UpliftingNews,removed,subverting natural selection do we really want this kid to grow up and spread his genes
UpliftingNews,removed,this subreddit is depressing as fuck

UpliftingNews,removed,prove what that im a kidney donor no i give fucks to prove it to you or anyone else if you truly want to help you dont need some reddit stranger to help you contact them lift a finger theyre in the public eye it wont be hard or is that too much all talk ive seen many claim to want to help then cant make it miles to get blood drawn to begin the process id bet youre one of them oh your brother died and now you go around saying woe is me is that what he would have wanted i lost my dad on my fucking birthday to an unexpected accident and i carry on my family lives in a third world shit hole and weve lost to murder in years but we carry on so fuck that feeling sorry for yourself shit over your brother dying im sorry for your loss now buck up and live your life the onus is not on me come back to me when youve saved three human lifes in your lifetime and by risking your own life all like i did i got the scar mental and physical but three people have life because of me and this right here this anonymous reddit bullshit is as close to bragging as ive ever come go make a difference i did
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe if they werent fighting for the needs of corporate america they wouldnt of been hurt why not sign up for the peace corps live by the sword die by the sword
UpliftingNews,removed,your offer did not infuriate me nothing youve done infuriates me well maybe all the edits good for you soldier or cop whichever good on the bombs and guns if its true oh and if youre not triggered yet you might want to sit down ready fuck your brother and fuck you try not to break anything bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,dont worry ill give her an organ
UpliftingNews,removed,right never have any ideas someone smarter than you probably already had it really just dont do anything someone else would do it better fuck off man
UpliftingNews,removed,catholic priests have that beat they donate one specific organ to each altar boy they meet
UpliftingNews,removed,yes you wanna watch
UpliftingNews,removed,yes hold your head up high im a coward youre a hero for going on reddit to say youre gonna give him a kidney please
UpliftingNews,removed,i know i know im a dirtbag i voted for trump too so im also a racist but the world is a better place because of me not too many people can say that youre welcome btw yeah im beating my chest ive earned the right to beat my chest on reddit anonymously but yeah im a dirtbag
UpliftingNews,removed,whos trolling a sick child what a baseless stupid accusation id fare just fine in the long run telling you fuck your brother to your face because youre probably all talk in person too worst case scenario you kick my ass i heal and go back to a great life and your life is never the same after incarceration so if thats what youd like to see then ok sicko anything else dedicate all this energy to donating your kidney which you never will who are we kidding
UpliftingNews,removed,organ donation should be default yeah because you know my profession and my intelligence good one buddy should i assume youre stupid too for any idea you come up with
UpliftingNews,removed,and a dirtbag
UpliftingNews,removed,thanks for the advice and insight youve changed my life stranger on the internet
UpliftingNews,removed,i think youre the butthurt one seeing as how growing up without a father is what leads you to make such dumb comments
UpliftingNews,removed,thanks and you be you mmkay
UpliftingNews,removed,quite advanced for a tween though right i got you all riled up apologies accepted now go make a difference
UpliftingNews,removed,okay well im not the first to suggest thisbut it should be law that your organs are donated to saving lives as a default just my opinion
UpliftingNews,removed,holy shit are you high im a donor moron do you read or just downvote as the feces spews from your mouth onto reddit imagine if all this energy were devoted to saving a life but nah youd rather talk big on reddit selfish you are but i do appreciate the entertainment
UpliftingNews,removed,i made cookies for my neighbor today what did you do i donated of my organs to my son
UpliftingNews,removed,you are a sexist pig
UpliftingNews,removed,im sorry but im becoming incredibly frustrated by this attitude towards science recently do you really think your limited anecdotal opinion has anywhere near the same weight as a properly written data driven scientific paper do you understand the hours spent meticulously collecting data and analyzing the data not to mention an editorial board of their peers reviewing every result under a microscope to see if the conclusions of the study is correct im curious what makes you believe you know better than these people because its happening more and more from vaccinations to global warming where people seem to think they know more than someone who has dedicated their lives to a subject its blatant fucking disrespect of these hardworking underpaid people who seek to learn more about our world and ignoring their information in order to preserve whatever pride or ego you have is fucking idiotic basically go fuck yourself dont get the surgery then and doom your child to a shitty life fuck you
UpliftingNews,removed,there seems to be a comprehension problem here for you and others i did not claim i lived in a third world country ill wait until you catch up
UpliftingNews,removed,all the men in my family on one side have had kidney issues usually in their odds are i will as well but im young and there is not a situation where one kidney goes bad and the other is good so my high likelihood of serious kidney issues in the future has no relevance to me donating a kidney that is currently fine not for me or the recipient im also way ahead of all the other family members by years of knowing what could happen and thus i treat my remaining kidney very nicely i read it bedtime stories and let it know that its loved by avoiding certain substances that in the long run will harm it ive named it rick btw rick the kidney hes cool cleans my pee
UpliftingNews,removed,women will do anything to protect their child if he came from chad sperm
UpliftingNews,removed,brits
UpliftingNews,removed,i read that as colored officer steps in donuts with dad
UpliftingNews,removed,showing off his patrol his patrol car to the kids is proof reading not a thing anymore isnt this supposed to be a legitimate news outlet i feel like i see ridiculous typos like this all the time in actual news articles
UpliftingNews,removed,i ran over a dog on the highway with my ton truck thump thump
UpliftingNews,removed,i mean i think shes hotter than obese people please dont ban more
UpliftingNews,removed,obviously most here are animal lovers people that have an abundance of compassion for animals please consider this article and how it made you feel next time you make a choice about what to eat choose plant not animal
UpliftingNews,removed,you could donate that money to help a human more useful than keeping an old dying dog alive
UpliftingNews,removed,thats an awful lot of baseless assumptions there
UpliftingNews,removed,what a crock of selfserving shit
UpliftingNews,removed,would be nice to hear her dads side of the story something tells me mom isnt going to be telling the media she actually got caught fucking the milkman or whatever
UpliftingNews,removed,hes not going to make it none of us are
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting the sheer amount of fail by literally everyone involved with this story is staggering beyond belief this is suicide fuel right here
UpliftingNews,removed,this hit me in the feels hard until it said the local wagon store was out of wagons i laughed audibly
UpliftingNews,removed,mine were until it said the local wagon store was out of wagons for some reason i found that hilarious
UpliftingNews,removed,talk about making a baseless assumption
UpliftingNews,removed,my first thought with how she had no idea was is she fat or really fat
UpliftingNews,removed,how damn fat was this woman to not know she was pregnant
UpliftingNews,removed,and exactly wtf is uplifting about this
UpliftingNews,removed,i have an on purpose american hairless rat terrier papers and everything he looks like stitch he is an asshole like every minute of the day asshole but i guess he fits in with my asshole householdi have to keep reminding myself he is a dollar asshole i would upload a pic but imgur is being a cuntthe most common comment is that he looks like the chu ca barra or i get angry people yelling at me for painting my dog blue sorry just ranting because that hampster is getting more love then anyone has gave my stupid dog that i love so much
UpliftingNews,removed,possibly correct youve been publicly shamed sir boaty mcboatface sfw we are frustrated with adp rogers communication and james doesnt know if he can trust general motors we discuss our petition and the impact of social media shaming and ron johnsons book so youve been publicly shamed httpswwwchangeorgpjojohnsonsirdavidattenboroughtochangehisnametoboatymcboatface
UpliftingNews,removed,hey man found a great
UpliftingNews,removed,either detroit food is cheap or ive been getting shorted on birthday money all these years
UpliftingNews,removed,i am so fucking cynical these days all i can think is mom put the little shit up to it to get upvotes

UpliftingNews,removed,imagining that pulp fiction scene about the watch
UpliftingNews,removed,all lives matter yo blm we gotta slap sum sense into this little bih lets dox her parents and shit i dont see her buying no lunch for alton or harambe smh
UpliftingNews,removed,this is a great story to show black lives matter fanatics black police officers exist heres a picits not just white racist cops out there and there are black children out there that support the police who would have known the mainstream media obviously wont be sharing this story
UpliftingNews,removed,how about you buy lunch for starving children instead of the notsecret police
UpliftingNews,removed,fallacy of anecdotal evidence statistically a black person stopped by a cop is way more likely than a white person to be killed stories about individual incidents fall on both sides and seeing one story or another in the media is no reflection on the statistics just on the interest level of the editors or likers or sharers people of all kinds should always let the cop be in control of an encounter cops need to not have a dealingwithblacks setting on their trigger fingers
UpliftingNews,removed,link to source i feel like anecdotes on either side wont get us too far as no one said blacks get shot every single time during a traffic stop
UpliftingNews,removed,propoganda isnt uplifting news
UpliftingNews,removed,she gave the lunch to the black cops cuz black cops dont kill a brother
UpliftingNews,removed,were the white cops just left to starve
UpliftingNews,removed,does her shirt say i slaves
UpliftingNews,removed,its the other way round good shit and bad shit happens all the time its the fucking media who first try to horrify you and then highlight random acts of kindness when people are all low cos drama and trp its pathetic
UpliftingNews,removed,not really i mean why cant we lead with the nice things and then continue to do even nicer things if we have to horrid things to each other before we do the nice things theres no net gain
UpliftingNews,removed,did they shoot her before or after she handed the food over
UpliftingNews,removed,it was cute at first when the first little girl setup the lemonade stand to give to the officers but now the novelty is wearing off
UpliftingNews,removed,havent cringed so hard in years
UpliftingNews,removed,agreed that nigger and nigger lover are just sitting around thinking of ways to divide our perfect people sigh why cant we go back to the good old daysm
UpliftingNews,removed,innocent black men being killed nice meme
UpliftingNews,removed,good now the thugs cant steal it from her once theyve murdered her in cold blood and use it for anti cop peaceful protests
UpliftingNews,removed,samya also passed out around bagged lunches horrifying
UpliftingNews,removed,update the year old girl has been neutralized
UpliftingNews,removed,were the white officers all killed off
UpliftingNews,removed,how nice what a lucky coincidence the wwj news team was there to capture every moment and a printed certificate at the officers ready to give out along with her pin so natural so pure not planned at all
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont understand why the police officers have their own money why would the parents not use this opportunity as an educational lesson about which adults need our help and which ones can take care of themselves why would the police officers accept none of it makes sense to me
UpliftingNews,removed,the usa you mean also she doesnt understand two things thatre obvious that hairstyle is disgusting and how to lose weight
UpliftingNews,removed,the next day they shot her dad for a broken tail light
UpliftingNews,removed,thank god they didnt seize her assets
UpliftingNews,removed,innocent police officers being killed why do people keep calling the police innocent they picked a side nobody would call me innocent if i was killed after siding with irish loyalists
UpliftingNews,removed,a few of those cops should try skipping lunch
UpliftingNews,removed,would have been news worthy if the cops were white
UpliftingNews,removed,great will that bring back of their dead colleagues
UpliftingNews,removed,ive always wondered why are police staff overweight
UpliftingNews,removed,hey a few months ago i banged a hooked without a condom i just got my std test back and im clean guess this means all those warning about safe sex were just social media propaganda l
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure her birthday money was essential for her to use for herself in order to stave off starvation now she wont have money to feed herself for several days s
UpliftingNews,removed,her mom put her up to it not sure why americans love these stories of boot licking quite so much also any time any story mentions heshe used their birthday money for this omg what a selfless child it was the fucking parents every time the fucking kid did not think of this her mombie forced the idea for facebook likes
UpliftingNews,removed,looks like they could use it they look starved
UpliftingNews,removed,they sure vid that white policewomen well
UpliftingNews,removed,how the fuck is this remotely uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,that cops are the people who cant afford lunch
UpliftingNews,removed,but den they busted a cap in her black ass
UpliftingNews,removed,the cops and other programs have been taking of her parents earning for years
UpliftingNews,removed,it was either this or get shot of course she will have to give them her lunch money every week now seriously though lets see if the gratitude is returned
UpliftingNews,removed,only black officers in this photo this girl is a racist shit
UpliftingNews,removed,now they can use tater tots to fillin the bullet holes
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure this will be a controversial comment but these small acts of kindness do nothing in the grand scheme of mending police and intercity black relations stories like these solely exist to make us feel good about ourselves while simultaneously doing nothing your chicagos and detroits will continue to do what they do
UpliftingNews,removed,liberals seem to operate purely on emotions
UpliftingNews,removed,what a disgusting misrepresentation
UpliftingNews,removed,that girl is paying protection money
UpliftingNews,removed,some bootlickers still have sympathy for fascist goosestepping pigs
UpliftingNews,removed,this must be the most retarded girl in the world
UpliftingNews,removed,i do think this is a really nice story but dont typically think of treating someone out for a meal as a way to thank them being generous i like to think this little girl genuinely did feel bad about what happened to the police officers and her parents suggested this as a good use of her birthday money nothing wrong with that but im pretty skeptical the kid said lets take them out to lunch with this or whatever kids get these days get off my lawn while youre at it
UpliftingNews,removed,i wanted to show them that all lives matter lol yes but all lives are not at equal risk during routine traffic stops in the united states of amerikkka i imagine that when she reaches the age of consciousness she will learn this harsh lesson
UpliftingNews,removed,it was a pretty good photo op even if it was staged
UpliftingNews,removed,would she have done it for white officers
UpliftingNews,removed,i wanted to site them all lives matter ugh thats so problematic get on the right side of history little girl
UpliftingNews,removed,i thought it was gonna end with her going for a gun then being dogpiled and swiftly executed by the cops s
UpliftingNews,removed,notice how no one in this picture is white little black girl hugging a white guy would go against the race war narrative the media has been trying to cram down everyones throat like charles mother fucking manson
UpliftingNews,removed,stupid little brat wasting your money on the oppressors ahh hell no fuck that shit shes lucky they didnt fuckn shoot her this pisses me off so god damn much pigs piiiiggggsss no justice no peace blacklivesmatter fuck the police acab
UpliftingNews,removed,okay how does this help anything shes nine she probably doesnt even understand quite what is happening in the world
UpliftingNews,removed,guess we should show more kids of police getting shot
UpliftingNews,removed,sounds like a bribe to me
UpliftingNews,removed,innocents blacks murdered cops murdered in a retaliatory strike but have i got some great news for you
UpliftingNews,removed,what a cunt
UpliftingNews,removed,totally agree its for parents to put their children up as trophies on social media
UpliftingNews,removed,what a waste of money
UpliftingNews,removed,so much propaganda
UpliftingNews,removed,she was going to buy lunch for the victims of a militarized police force but the officers would have shot her for reaching into her pockets
UpliftingNews,removed,well some do those rare ones are called good cops however then they become bad cops because they dont call out the shit in their workforce now the bad has outweighed the good some of these guys do and here we are full antipolice
UpliftingNews,removed,supports all lives brings food only for the black apes
UpliftingNews,removed,soooo donuts
UpliftingNews,removed,how is it uplifting when shes helping a bunch of black shooters
UpliftingNews,removed,straight up coonery
UpliftingNews,removed,dont teach that girl to be friendly to the police this sends the wrong message
UpliftingNews,removed,oh yes use your money to feed americas death squad little girl then maybe they woulnt kill you
UpliftingNews,removed,except its detroit the police dont help with shit cause there is so much crime and every officer and citizen there is african american
UpliftingNews,removed,i know this is all well and good but you cant possibly think saying something like lets all be friends and buying lunch will get rid of social problems prejudices and racism along with white privilege
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,i hate these stories they reek of bullshit theres always some preteen buying cops or homeless people food
UpliftingNews,removed,great cynicism on a sub for uplifting news fuck off

UpliftingNews,removed,now thatll be a relationship with some ups and downs wow im a cunt
UpliftingNews,removed,well im a neurologist who treats adults of the time i do have a few pediatric patients ive had parents of a cognitively impaired adult ask me for letters asserting that their cognitive issues limits their ability to consent ive always referred them to he state in years the one case of an adult aged person with this issue already had a normal child with the other person but had some lottery winnings which caused the problem the lottery winnings were not to be shared with her common law spouse due to her cognitive limitations it was a confusion and stressful situation for all the persons family cared for her deeply and gave her a life many of us doint have trainers for the special olympics a job support and housing well into her care and tutoring for her daughter and even a place for the common law cognitively impaired husband at the table but once she won a significan amount of money in the lottery they wanted to limit how she could use it i could not help them she was impaired but given how independant she was otherwiise i could not morally state that her common law husband was taking advantage of her they had a relatively functional year old together and kept an appartment next to her moms home in reasonable condition the whole situation was a disaster where she felt abused and betrayed by her family i understand where they where coming from but i also did not feel i could offer a legitimate opinion they wanted that limited her use of lottery winnings the last time i saw any of them was when i was deposed in court about this dr gags in your opinion can xxxxx user her money to her own desires wihtout harm to her or others yes thank you maam more or less my patient is cognitively impaired compared to many but she still has the ability to own property and make decisions and ive personally made shitty financial dicisions in my life and i cant say that she doesnt have the right to spend before taxes on gummy bears its an odd situation
UpliftingNews,removed,eh wow withdrawing consent long after the event has passed is a dick move
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder which subreddit they met on
UpliftingNews,removed,i know theyre so fucking stupid but i really felt touched in an appropriate way emotionally by seeing that even these types of poor poor humans can express feelings to others who share their severe affliction god bless them shame they have such short lifespans

UpliftingNews,removed,fucking retarded kid
UpliftingNews,removed,first its not one or the other nobody is out there saying fuck ptsd i want to sew dicks to people it is entirely possible for progress to be made in different things at the same time shocking as it may seem second its hell of a lot easier to work with the brick and mortar of the human body surgery isnt easy of course but its a hell of a lot easier than finding what makes things go wrong in the brain
UpliftingNews,removed,im not trying to be rude but what you described is not at all what psychedelic drugs are like at average doses and your comment only further encourages the misconception that the only purpose of muschrooms is to see crazy shit like dragons
UpliftingNews,removed,can you draw them

UpliftingNews,removed,unfortunately if you actually read the article you will find out that because they were volunteering he got away with out paying them there correct wages yet he held them to their contractual obligation to i dont know what the fuck im talking about
UpliftingNews,removed,your answer really doesnt inspire confidence in you understanding consent nonverbal consent cues are established in law as are nonverbal denial of consent cues that you think its okay to cry rape because someone begins sexual intercourse with you after you invite them back to your room for coffee and then take your top off while you refuse to revoke consent or deny consent is a problem with you and not some poor kid who youre trying to falsely claim raped you

UpliftingNews,removed,your country you realize that by othering others you cause more than just that set of others to consider you part of a voluntary undesirable minority i think of folks such as yourself as being ideal for the venus terraforming project or perhaps a martian icemining camp
UpliftingNews,removed,she looks like a he so
UpliftingNews,removed,old news trying to play on emotions fuck you uplifting news you are failing your function
UpliftingNews,removed,sharia law is about the same sort of idea as the tripe the family research council puts out same idea that religious doctrine is more important than civil law and that it should actually determine civil law america is a christian nation same general ideas about the place of women barefoot pregnant and suchlike same general ideas about gays dead preferably certainly not publicly visible the only difference is what they have been allowed to get away with and those are constraints that will apply just as strongly as anyone trying to run sharia law in their little enclaves of ideological purity
UpliftingNews,removed,do it over there until you get your shit together
UpliftingNews,removed,oh the fucking irony
UpliftingNews,removed,if they started bragging that they are physically superior beings because someone from their country won a tournament yes i would have you met a persian

UpliftingNews,removed,actually maybe im a stupid commie but ive heard a biofarmer speak at a lecture apperantly dont say its true havent fact checked but are small biofarms better for sustaining us we could go full green energy live less wasteful farm smarter stop polluting build water filtering facilities plant forests why is it not happening because that would decrease consumption thus profit that would have to have a radical change in how we think about things as a world they dont want it to change they want profit now cut those forests fuck regulation fuck yea oil then people come up with diaspora no just identify the proper ways to survive as a species its possible just not profitable
UpliftingNews,removed,india is making the world a better place i wish the us could try to compete with them on this metric
UpliftingNews,removed,those laws were ot jesus actually never mentions homosexuality but had alot to say on adultery and divorce it was john i believe that said homosexuality was wrong after jesus died
UpliftingNews,removed,i believe you are falsely equivocating sexually immoral with homosexual this now places the burden on showing that those two items are in fact linked in scripture and in context to the letter you quoted for those wondering is quoting corinthians
UpliftingNews,removed,ah no it clearly doesnt support homosexuality but there is actually some heavy biblical interpretation in this thread that suggests it may not be as frowned upon in the bible as first thought
UpliftingNews,removed,as christians the right response is prayer and education yeah lets pray the gay away thatll work
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah we werent in control of the original sin looking back im sure we wish we could change it but because sin came into the world we just have to deal with it and try our best not to give in im certainly not perfect but because i believe and have faith in god i know that someday i will live in perfection in heaven do you believe that you have morals or a moral code
UpliftingNews,removed,im upvoting you and heres why just because the parent posters were civil in their tone doesnt mean theyre not intolerant assholes quoting the bible to tell someone why their relationship is wrong is incredibly insulting i feel like im seeing more and more of this shit on reddit lately and its getting old
UpliftingNews,removed,i made a similar comment and someone said that every church in fact does do this and it is up to me to prove otherwise because that makes sense
UpliftingNews,removed,hypocritical thing to do
UpliftingNews,removed,so constructive great argument definitley proved youre point youre so mature
UpliftingNews,removed,so if someone claims to have turned straight youre inclined to believe him but if millions claim its not a choice youre sceptical isnt that your own judging at play
UpliftingNews,removed,oh fuck off
UpliftingNews,removed,warning elements of religious indoctrination below also you need to be aware that if you are a christian who believes thar homosexuality is a sin against god and your child lives a homosexual life they have turned their back on god and will not be entering the kingdom of god with you the penalty for sin any sin is death eternal and separation from god accepting the blood sacrifice of the christ figure is redemption from sin to have life eternal and be joined with god sinning and making mistakes while holding the faith is not a death sentence or a reversal of redemption but you must make thendecision between committing tomgod and committing to sin you can committ to god but still struggle when you committ to sin such as living a homosexual life you turn your back on god and you deminstrate no faith in the sacrifice of jesus you will not be saved so you can smile and say supportive crap and go to the wedding etc but youre hiding from a part of your faith and not living an examined life when you do so source religious indoctrination that i do not nor ever did believe but is an absolutely common belief
UpliftingNews,removed,please immolate yourself in protest
UpliftingNews,removed,well the pastor supports trump so this story is just feel good crap the pastor is an asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,acceptance of sexual immorality is unbiblical in every possible way any preacher or teacher that promotes or condonesor even gives it a pass is living in direct defiance of god and should do some serious self reflection and repentance and yet divorce is generally allowed in protestant circles even without adultery being involved despite jesus christ very specifically saying that that is sexual immorality all religions pick and choose and all religions pretend that however theyve picked and chose is the only possible way its pretty much what religion is
UpliftingNews,removed,what is your aim here youre being rude and questioning him on why he is gay and youre making claims that he wouldnt actually go through with sex with a man from what basis does that come from your own personal opinion on how some complete stranger to you would act youre displaying your views and letting everyone in the comments know that you cant grasp and therefore cant accept homosexuality because of your apparent religious background just because you are formulating your opinions in question form as if this guy has the answers as to why he is gay which nobody knows is pretty annoying and its also annoying how you are acting like a victim because your controversial views upset people for some odd reason stop acting like you are totally okay with homosexuality when you persistently keep questioning the simplest things about this whole situation
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont actually find this uplifting at all as an exgay christian i have a unique view but my identity is in christ not the world
UpliftingNews,removed,there are so many denominations in christianity and so many different views on different things theyre all just different interpretations who are you to say his interpretation is wrong its uplifting news because he defended his son and what he believes in
UpliftingNews,removed,thats the whole reason jesus came to the earth he so god gave itself to itself so he could appease itself so much for that omnipotence right and then god forgives man for a crime he didnt have a choice in so much for love and forgiveness right we have a personal direct connection to forgivenes i dont want it no one speaks for me and no one claims anything for me i am my own person and i dont believe that i should get blamed for someone elses crime be forgiven for them as do mine you agree that those who dont believe in jesuss teachings are wrong yes you agree that christians should condemn homosexuals right or sex outside of marriage and what brought us to the point of realizing that we need them at all well as society advanced people started living together rules were necessary to govern behavior for social cohesion we have hammurabis code but there were rules before too im sure is this a rhetorical question there would have to be something opposite of what our morals are that made us discover and learn that we cant go around hating people or murdering or stealing aah so you believe the only reason something exists is for its opposite to exist you dont believe humans can have inherent goodness so for example if i were an atheist i couldnt be a good person taught human values to not hate or hurt others and defend others when i could
UpliftingNews,removed,who gives a shit the world is moving on and the church has to accept the changes and adapt to them or die and if they didnt people would see through the bullshit and start to turn away until the church was left with no more followers and no more money
UpliftingNews,removed,are you a church goer what do you think of this verse and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont see why youre so hung up on the enduring thing lets say those people you directed us toward so longer feel attraction toward the same sex that is the feelings are not enduring well the people no longer identify as homosexual so the enduring thing has nothing to do with them
UpliftingNews,removed,i find it disrespectful of you that you dont consider that not all girls are interested in guys and some girls are interested in girls
UpliftingNews,removed,if you ever sat down and told your child you disagreed with the fact that they were born gay you would be doing more harm than if you flat out punched them in the face doing such a horrific hateful cruel thing shows how much you dont love them that you would literally prefer they hadnt been born as they were that a fundamental of them is wrong if youre that much of a disgusting evil bigot find the remote semblance of a conscience and keep that hateful shit to yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,the thing is that being gay is actually dangerous the only way to help is through love and support and listening same thing with suicidal people or pretty much anyone people will listen to those who clearly care about them
UpliftingNews,removed,its great what he did for his son but it doesnt change the what their book teaches they can choose to ignore it but theres no getting around the fact that their religion literally calls for the son to be killed how any gay person or anyone who loves a gay person can be a christianjewmuslim is beyond me
UpliftingNews,removed,i truly dont understand so you can just ignore the parts of the bible that are inconvenient for you
UpliftingNews,removed,actually thats exactly what the bible says timothy lays out how youre supposed to deal with sin in the church and the last step if they refuse to renounce their sin is to have them leave the church remember jesus forgave the prostitute being stoned and then he told her to go forth and sin no more
UpliftingNews,removed,yep i can respect people who stick to their beliefs this guy hes a hypocrite
UpliftingNews,removed,idk if hes a christian pastor but this totally goes against christianity
UpliftingNews,removed,christians dont follow mosaic laws they follow the ones established from the new testament so please stop copying and pasting this when someone says the bible doesnt support homosexuality
UpliftingNews,removed,very basic christ said love thy neighbor as thyself no exceptions so if my neighbor is homosexual treat them the same as i would want to be treated dont lump them in with idolators adulterers or similar from pauls lists ill cite another thing christ said judge not lest ye be judged
UpliftingNews,removed,hes great for being gay
UpliftingNews,removed,to be fair your questions are leading and nonsensical its like me asking why wouldnt you use vanilla bean powder in your homemade vanilla ice cream when the answer is because thats not how i make it you can probe and prod all you like but no ones obligated to answer your weird questions they just dont really apply instead of trying to abrasively pigeonhole people why not focus on educating yourself volunteer for an lgbtq organization do some academic reading exercise empathy etc theyre good places to start if youre serious about making personal intellectual progress
UpliftingNews,removed,and how do you propose to sternly correct your lesbian daughter httpsenwikipediaorgwikicorrectiverape
UpliftingNews,removed,and let me be clear im a homosexual atheist
UpliftingNews,removed,fucking hell the title makes it appear pastor couldnt wait to be the trendiest pastor in town with his gay son to show off to yall lets face it nobody wants their kids to be gay unless they are fucked up sjws normal people want kids and grandkids homos are perfectly entitled to rugmunch or cockgobble instead i have no problem but for a short time we live in a slightly secular world were being gay is allowed even trendy its not going to last long though sharia and islamism is taking over the west at a vast rate prepare yourselves for hurling off buildings and getting stoned to death what is absurd is the lgbtq are obsessed with islam with all its brutality and ignorance being even more important than them
UpliftingNews,removed,im not sure what kind of christian accepts being gay as okay a lukewarm christian to say the least maybe a calvinist but this is where the media is screwing up again they like to scream about the hatred gay people are getting from christians miraculously gays are criticized by christians right and they glorify those christians who turn against god to be praised by men what the media doesnt show and what a majority of christians dont understand is that gay people are just like everybody else everybody sins no christian should be okay with sin likewise no christian should criticize a particular sin personally i hate the way that being gay is seen as right at least in most cases but i hate seeing fellow christians and close friends hating gay people like theyre some new sin that rises above the others because its not
UpliftingNews,removed,good think he isnt a muslim or he would be put top death
UpliftingNews,removed,hey progressive christian here the practice of homosexuality that saint paul was condemning wasnt like modern gay relationships at all it wasreally bad a lot of grown gay men bought little boys to have sex with there was a lot of hedonistic sex parties and people often had sex with prostitutes at temples that was the kind of sexual act saint paul was warning against he didnt write anything about our concept of gay relationships today because he didnt know about them also i dont see the bible as the literal word of god fyi thats mostly a conservative protestant thing and im a cool moderate anglocatholictm
UpliftingNews,removed,truth too bad its being down voted
UpliftingNews,removed,i think thats an unfair statement some people just dont understand until it becomes personal this is what happened with my parents when i came out i think that if a person changes for the better then it doesnt really matter what got them there
UpliftingNews,removed,homosexuality isnt a gender its a sexuality
UpliftingNews,removed,this
UpliftingNews,removed,he is a faggot fuck him
UpliftingNews,removed,nah pretty sure ignoring a lot of godgiven rules is just a new interpretation of the bible s if you already tailor your perfect religion to fit your own moral compass either the religion is flawed or you are wrong if the religion is flawed how could it be the supreme truth if you tailor it to your likings anyways why follow it
UpliftingNews,removed,personally i believe every rational person who identify as gay and christian should have some say on these questions thats a very interesting set of questions what exactly do these questions tell you and why should every gay christian be expected to answer them please be as specific as possible because im genuinely interested in your reasoning
UpliftingNews,removed,its not so clear though i dont remember anywhere where it clearly says it in fact a lot of what we think to be true about christianity is made on implications from the bible
UpliftingNews,removed,the bible also gives similar prohibitions against mixed fiber clothing women on their periods tattoos and all these fuckers running around inked up wearing cotton and rayon and earning their red wings
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah well there are an awful lot of other rules modern christians dont follow either did you know women need to cover their heads to pray or that going to church on your period is a sin or thatbleeding makes you unclean also no pork or shellfish all of those rules are ignored but homosexually oh no youre gonna burn in hell you monster excuse me while i eat bacon wrapped clams while paying without covering my head
UpliftingNews,removed,there are also just pages and pages of family lineages that dont mention god or anything spiritual or ethical
UpliftingNews,removed,you arent actually a christian you are more of a fucking garbage human stain fyi hth
UpliftingNews,removed,doesnt this goes against the teachings of the bible does this mean hes a bad christian after all to be a good christian you need to be a person pretty much like islam
UpliftingNews,removed,this id wonderful but im always confused because isnt being gay pretty much accepted in the first world why is it some crazy success story when someone displays what is the norm
UpliftingNews,removed,so a person with mental and physical disabilities worked at mcdonalds for years how is that uplifting news honestly the thought of anyone working at mcdonalds for that long just depresses me
UpliftingNews,removed,did she even age
UpliftingNews,removed,im amazed she worked at mcdonalds for years without being murdered by a coworker her best day was probably successfully cleaning the bathroom back in or some shit
UpliftingNews,removed,whats so uplifting about the fact this guy wants to get fucked in the ass i mean at best its acceptable but uplifting fucking barrage of constant brainwashing got all you fools contorted into a bretzel
UpliftingNews,removed,so what
UpliftingNews,removed,its not charity of people where receiving needed aid to be a part of our society there needs to be a shift in what we consider charity and social aid
UpliftingNews,removed,i dunnomaybe she did something in it
UpliftingNews,removed,wow settle down you psychopath
UpliftingNews,removed,lgbt i am not a member of lgbtblt or httpmcdonaldswikiacomwikimcdlt i am just gay and i have my own mind you just stereotyped me and you owe me an apopogy we are not being oppressed anymore we do not need wheel chair ramps or special elevators or special bathrooms nor have he ever unless you start talking about who you are currently fucking who you have fucked in the past or who you want to fuck if sonmeone tells a transgender person not to use a restroom all they have to say is it is just a costume dude get over it i like dressing this way and i have the right to i have the right to speak any way i choose if i want to act like hitler and dress up in a costume and i have the right to speak german i am not a rubber stampped stereotype i will not have people stamp or assume i am a member of lgbt gay means happy i like that much better than a fucking acronym that sounds like a sandwich the rainbow belongs to everybody i feel offended that lgbt has claimed that i feel offended that they are speaking in my behalf and possibly firing up bigots who may physically harm me they need to say they are some of the gay community i am not part of the club i did not get a vote they never even fucking asked me if the name was ok in the first place
UpliftingNews,removed,she probably heard about the mcchicken shit wanted no part in that
UpliftingNews,removed,really dude get some professional help for your anger issues this is going to come out in a very inopportune time one day if you dont deal with it now

UpliftingNews,removed,i hope he kept his receipt
UpliftingNews,removed,this guys a hindu who likes shitting on other peoples faiths especially abrahamic faiths all this while hinduism teaches men to beat wives with sticks like some branches of islam and judaism
UpliftingNews,removed,this guys full of hatred for the abrahamic faiths and ironically hes a hindu who defends its violent tendencies
UpliftingNews,removed,the bible is known for several contradictions so is your religion hinduism
UpliftingNews,removed,so fast food workers with down syndrome are more successful than i am cool
UpliftingNews,removed,if you get a transplanted hand and masturbate does that mean that a dead man is jacking you off technically im assuming transplant hands come from dead people since its not like bone marrow or a kidney

UpliftingNews,removed,if its not stem its not a real degree none of the other subjects are at all difficult or challenging
UpliftingNews,removed,at least they were fun on smack now all they do is preach
UpliftingNews,removed,they probably just got so used to the crazy crackhead religious experiences that they had already been having for several decades and wanted to validate all the crazy crack dreams they had been having with some substance other than more crackso a crackhead degree was the best option
UpliftingNews,removed,no awesome at all i am so tired of this internet culture of posting pictures of everyone without their permission people deserve privacy and respect i dont care if they got over their addiction i shouldnt have to know they used to take drugs and neither should their friends or relatives
UpliftingNews,removed,no awesome at all i am so tired of this internet culture of posting pictures of everyone without their permission people deserve privacy and respect i dont care if they got over their addiction i shouldnt have to know they used to take drugs and neither should their friends or relatives

UpliftingNews,removed,if you get bored drugs and alcohol will always be waiting for you like long lost friends ☺
UpliftingNews,removed,you were called a fool that doesnt make you a victim good lord you need to get some perspective quit acting like i assassinated your character seriously you need to realize being called a fool doesnt make you a victim and isnt someone berating you that comment getting deleted doesnt change any of that also me calling you a fool doesnt negate any of my points i feel like im taking crazy pills here why are you acting like this is kindergarten what have i missed
UpliftingNews,removed,who gives a fuck

UpliftingNews,removed,please do i would like to see more on the topic
UpliftingNews,removed,idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,my point was literally true which is why its so easy to find articles about corals recovering from severe bleaching events after not very many years you want a different reef how about hawaii or maybe how about costa rica httpwwwwriorgcostaricareeflifeafterbleaching how about the maldives if you that think once a reef is bleached it is permanently lost then you may be watching fakenews fortunately coral is more resilient and grows back faster than most people think httpwwwreefresilienceorgcoralreefsstressorsbleachingresistancetoleranceandrecovery
UpliftingNews,removed,this is great news

UpliftingNews,removed,they look like shaved monkeys
UpliftingNews,removed,cant wait until trump replaces the kenyan muslim
UpliftingNews,removed,this is the closest theyll get to being superiorwhite
UpliftingNews,removed,til being attractive and competing in a beauty contest are not synonymous
UpliftingNews,removed,people being baffled how much witchdoctors pay for albino limbs or bodies it is prolly the same as the asians do you even know how many asians pay their asian lesser deity or whatever mishmash religions for all kinds of rituals blessing anti curse health ask advice from deities or speak to deceased from thousands to ten thousands to hundred thousands of dollarseuros
UpliftingNews,removed,is this not just a way of coralling witchdoctor victims into a single area as well as white rhinos and all the other white animals that the africans fucking hate and at the same time covet even more than a typical sjw blm fuckwit does because now we find that white pigment is actually a scientific thing and the cultural wonderful diverse people are fucking utter criminal scum with no compassion whatsoever
UpliftingNews,removed,because albinos are whiter than white google it assuming your white theres no way your own arm would pass for albino
UpliftingNews,removed,i think much like the current usa presidential candidate the typical african guy has an iq
UpliftingNews,removed,second largest continent with over countries and thousands of cultures and if there is a god he abandoned every single one of those shitholes i took a western civ class in college from a history prof with two phds albeit one was in latin american studies he taught us that when european explorers finally reached the interiors of africa disease was an issue tthey introduced the wheel you know what infuriates me that the civilized world allows that contentent to exist and we let them pretend they have meaningful cultures
UpliftingNews,removed,seriously from the pictures i saw none of them were beautiful this is just like giving the retard prom king just patronizing
UpliftingNews,removed,wait so africans are so racist they even hate blacks with albinism
UpliftingNews,removed,white black people are my favorite black people
UpliftingNews,removed,lol a big middlefinger too all those who said race is but skindeep
UpliftingNews,removed,north americans are fucking retarded then just because your country is literally the continent canada doesnt mean that every other country is its continent with q different skin australians seem to manage with calling france france and not europe
UpliftingNews,removed,gfy
UpliftingNews,removed,im pretty sure its actually because you cant argue with what is blatantly obvious that islam breeds intolerance show me a society that has net benefited from islam you cant

UpliftingNews,removed,id bang her
UpliftingNews,removed,she could always cosplay as a centauri babylon
UpliftingNews,removed,am i in rcringe or what
UpliftingNews,removed,too much makeup is the message to be insecure about your natural self
UpliftingNews,removed,finds out she has cancer posts a picture with eyes open and closed to showcase makeup job cancer hasnt stopped me from craving attention
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe it was the dress
UpliftingNews,removed,this is a job for rsavedyouaclick
UpliftingNews,removed,that kids like fucking white people
UpliftingNews,removed,tldr its important to be pretty if you look like a potato with a shaven head sucks to be you
UpliftingNews,removed,what message that pounds of make up can make you look like a doll
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting when she is helped by a bunch of artists to look great with no hair but of the population still look worse with hair these news dragged me down
UpliftingNews,removed,what a fucking freak
UpliftingNews,removed,i thought a remake of babylon was coming until i read headline the centauri had this hair style licked long ago
UpliftingNews,removed,when the cancer kills her it will stop her

UpliftingNews,removed,salazar clearly the bride of slytherin
UpliftingNews,removed,i have a new kink
UpliftingNews,removed,fucking old bravo
UpliftingNews,removed,we click bait now
UpliftingNews,removed,that sounds like such a clickbaity title
UpliftingNews,removed,as a woman i see a shit ton of smoke and mirrorsaka makeup makeup can make anyone pretty
UpliftingNews,removed,cancer stops you being a princess
UpliftingNews,removed,am i the only one who immediately opts out of websites that makes me take a survey before viewing the page
UpliftingNews,removed,please woman this is not attractive and her personality doesnt shine through much either
UpliftingNews,removed,aww man i was hoping it would be push ups sit ups and running every day s
UpliftingNews,removed,as if i needed another confirmation that being attractive is like living in a completely different world cancer shaved head no biggie still get preferential treatment not that im hating on anyone for it i mean congratulations for winning the genetic lottery as far as looks go but dont try to make yourself out to be one of us and strong because you lost your hair get your face disfigured while still keeping your sunny disposition and then ill be impressed
UpliftingNews,removed,now without makeup
UpliftingNews,removed,the funny bit is that you cant be a princess either way cancer or not you are some upper middle class highschooler yet you dress up as a princess youre not eight
UpliftingNews,removed,the term beautiful is losing its meaning anyone can put on a truckload of makeup and look like a barbie hair or no hair the message i get here is im not comfortable with how i look so heres how i wish i looked please call me perfect and goals and give me attention this is the definition of a selfcentered person
UpliftingNews,removed,shes looks like shes made out of fucking plastic covering yourself up in makeup is not brave
UpliftingNews,removed,i think a more natural beauty picture would have been more inspiring than the makeup coverage even if it wasnt intended it does seem like your hiding the hair loss behind layers of makeup your beautiful either way it just would have made more sense
UpliftingNews,removed,she looks like shes made out of fucking plastic
UpliftingNews,removed,teenager with cancer sends out inspiring message after losing her hair even if youve lost your hair the thick layer of makeup that shells your confidence can still remain intact
UpliftingNews,removed,she looks like shes made out of plastic if you need to wear pounds of makeup to look beautiful youre not beautiful
UpliftingNews,removed,so youre saying you cant lose or gain weight with the right diet and exercise regiment found the fatty
UpliftingNews,removed,the only message im getting from this is throw enough money at professionals and anyone can look beautiful stupid if you ask me not everyone is born into riches and people who are going through cancer usually have more important matters to worry about than posting dazzling selfies on instagram every day tldr ignore this almost no one her is rich enough self obsessed enough or dying enough to go through with dumb shit like this
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry but this is not inspiring when you have cancer the point is not to be pretty its to be fucking strong shes sending the wrong message here
UpliftingNews,removed,why not wear a wig instead of being pretentious
UpliftingNews,removed,not trying to be crude of anything but thats too much of makeup sorry had to say it
UpliftingNews,removed,while she does look like she is just humbly bragging thats shes pretty i will say that shes beautiful and i would fuck her cancer or no cancer
UpliftingNews,removed,third time its not rocket science im not sure why youre being intentionally obtuse take your antivaxx propaganda get the gtfo pathetic downer
UpliftingNews,removed,would do
UpliftingNews,removed,so basically really pretty girl gets cancer and gets reassured that shes still very pretty okay now how about the other of people oh thats right youre not pretty so we dont give a shit
UpliftingNews,removed,okay her entire message is sort of defeated by the fact that she poured all the makeup she owned into a bowl httpimgurcomacthwg
UpliftingNews,removed,i hate stuff like this its all about self promotion for the photographer and the girl theres no inspiration to be found its like taylor swift or oprah giving away gifts its all a stunt
UpliftingNews,removed,i care so little it actually flipped and i care enough to say i dont give a fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,its not a fetish or anything but i find bald women attractive shes still lovely though the drawnon eyebrows are too much
UpliftingNews,removed,omg all the hash tags shameless advertising disguised as a feel good article

UpliftingNews,removed,nothing says consumerism like filling a large box with trash
UpliftingNews,removed,is that how non americans spell honor
UpliftingNews,removed,conciseness is generally preferable sure but this is reddit no need to wax eloquent about a stylistic preference i also disagree that honor clearly indicates the person is alive again its preference please excuse the redundancy your excellence
UpliftingNews,removed,step pose as year old girl step join online communitychat rooms step request bears and list vacant house not listed in the area for sale as your address step teddy profit

UpliftingNews,removed,where do you draw the line some will argue that homosexuality is a mental illness and shouldnt be given civil rights others say they are born that way now the pedophiles want civil rights calming they are born that way however some people argue that its a mental illness
UpliftingNews,removed,what a waste of time and money its issues like this that should have been dealt with in the past not drag it out now when there are far more important things to discuss and decide on who cares what people do behind closed doors just stop shoving it in my face as i believe these rights should have been granted of years ago so give em a law to do it just stop makking a song and dance about itno one really cares you want to be treated equally then deal with no one caring about your cause as that is what happens to the hetros etc there is no hetro day etc and that ladies and gentlemen is true acceptance is that what you want but you want the pride marches too thats special treatment how dumb are we becoming where sexual identity and individualism trumps the greater good
UpliftingNews,removed,also first state to legalize incest

UpliftingNews,removed,dude im from queensland i of all know the reputation of a state is based on what the bottom is into be happy you lot are known for your greenies and incest note rather than your loggers and incest or your extermination of aboriginals and incest or incestuous children and incest

UpliftingNews,removed,another lie from a pathological liar is not uplifting news

UpliftingNews,removed,i want toilet paper that doesnt feel like newspaper unless bitches are putting newspaper quality tampons up their pussies then im ok with it otherwise i want better tp also fuck feminism and crying about everything
UpliftingNews,removed,what exactly is uplifting about this exhibition of institutionalized feminism as in female supremacy and prvilege why should male taxpayers be made to paid for cosmetic products that they have no access to just another disgusting example of regressive equality policies that are really just pamper into the hands of special interest groups
UpliftingNews,removed,as a male i have to consume more calories per day because of my larger body mass this is such an unfair tax i think the government should help support me
UpliftingNews,removed,basic human rights doesnt mean they get high quality shit it means they get basic shit dont try explaining that to the liberals
UpliftingNews,removed,these comments are a lot of the reason why shit wont change in this country oh it isnt for me fuck them i want stuff for meeee fuck you you depressing cunts
UpliftingNews,removed,this is a perfect example of how the left buys votes ladies here is a thought women are greater than of the population in the united states politicians know that if they give you free products that you will see them in a more favorable light the fact is these products arent free our taxes are raised higher than they already would in order to pay for these products and guess who suffers because of these policies men this is an income redistribution to women at the expense of men
UpliftingNews,removed,how is that something you would forget like seriously what teenager is not mature enough to take care of their own bodily functions you dont find a bunch of teenagers freaking out in the bathroom because they dont know how to use a toilet honestly im still trying to wrap my head around the fact that american schools provide lunch thats just weird
UpliftingNews,removed,serious dumb question can men get free condoms
UpliftingNews,removed,the lifestyles of women lol do you think women just decide to bleed monthly as like a fun activity its as much of a lifestyle as you growing armpit hair or having a face its just kind of a thing that happens

UpliftingNews,removed,better give men gold bond or something similar for their nuts
UpliftingNews,removed,women take advantage of the system more than men and they claim theyre oppressed bitch this society was built for you we were happy killing each other
UpliftingNews,removed,women getting special treatment nothing new here
UpliftingNews,removed,think of the disregard the number of men raped in prsion you know the phenomenon the term rape culture was coined to describe privileged upper middle class white women are being raped on campus because some ugly guy hit on them
UpliftingNews,removed,thats because thats snacks not a fucking necessity pretty massive difference they dont charge them to eat slop and beans which is a necessity
UpliftingNews,removed,found the lying convict
UpliftingNews,removed,prisoners dont have rights theyre prisoners
UpliftingNews,removed,its almost as if shes not in every prison in the country and theyre all ran differently
UpliftingNews,removed,like im sorry im irregular and wasnt expecting obviously i think it would be nice for schools to have basic supplies like tampons but you arent a quick learner are you
UpliftingNews,removed,some guys have perios though 💕
UpliftingNews,removed,entertainment isnt really a basic human right not that im advocating staring at a wall but tv shouldnt be on the cards access to vetted books is good though and educational resoirces text books study guides classes to get ged
UpliftingNews,removed,you think paying them more for the slave labor inside the prison is going to be benefit the state more than having suitable allowances of sanitary products for those that require them
UpliftingNews,removed,they hate women a lot because all women theyve encountered thus far in their lives have had the audacity to not want to touch their penis
UpliftingNews,removed,someone should give you a free bullet to the back of the head taintbreath

UpliftingNews,removed,you sexist pigs so why cant men get free condoms
UpliftingNews,removed,downvoted dont tell me to watch something in caps nigga
UpliftingNews,removed,to put that car out of commission because a bird decided to nest there doesnt seem to make much sense how about using that car to put in some real police work
UpliftingNews,removed,the stock photo isnt a modern orthodox jew its actually a much more conservative and mystical branch that would not be caught dead in a gay bar

UpliftingNews,removed,i guess hes trying to make up for shooting you in the head
UpliftingNews,removed,he must be waiting on that money to come in
UpliftingNews,removed,banksy is evil
UpliftingNews,removed,i mean obviously tattoos fun now lets give them fake cigarettes and have people pretending to be debt collectors call them all the time to give them the full bad life decisions experience and then theyll be having a really great time
UpliftingNews,removed,this is uplifting news from months ago
UpliftingNews,removed,that is fucking retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,sounds a bit rapey
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this uplifting news banksy is incredibly talented and hes got a definitive unique style but i dont care if its banksy or da vinci its worrying that weve got elementary school kids running around praising him like this and its easier to ask forgiveness than permission is even more so ultimately it worked out in this casebut hes a graffiti artist he might be a very very talented one but unless im totally wrong hes still a vandal tentoone theyre a few years away from a mess of not nearly as talented graffiti artists running around
UpliftingNews,removed,whats the message here supposed to be a burning tire is a way to infiltrate a stronghold for example a line of police in riot gear but this is at a school education is good thing and helps keep society from being unjust do young children really need to be exposed to fight the oppressor propaganda surely its better from all views to let children be happy and play in a bubble of comfort
UpliftingNews,removed,pretentious hack it isnt even real art
UpliftingNews,removed,really wish i lived close so i could throw fucking paint all over this piece of shit
UpliftingNews,removed,you cant keep his identity a secret its just some edgelord pr thing to do just like daft punk
UpliftingNews,removed,but nonsheltered children tend to make worse adults thats the point
UpliftingNews,removed,how fitting for him banksy is basically
UpliftingNews,removed,they are all white thats racist
UpliftingNews,removed,ya like that would stop me as a member of the public lol in night time
UpliftingNews,removed,banksy is not real banksy is nothing more than propoganda and a psyop banksy is dissodence banksy has no purpose and invokes zero change for the better banksy is not real
UpliftingNews,removed,remember its always easier to ask for forgiveness than permission thats the rapiest thing ive heard in a long time
UpliftingNews,removed,vandalise banksy
UpliftingNews,removed,he goes and vandalizes property he doesnt own if i had a building and that guy drew some bs in it you bet id be pressing charges
UpliftingNews,removed,remember its always easier to get forgiveness than permission much love banksy what a fucking piece of shit for encouraging kids to break rules and then ask for forgiveness later who passes on irresponsible advice like this to children vandals are never sorry for what they did and never ask for forgiveness they just leave their mark and the rest of taxpaying society has to spend the time and effort to clean up the mess left behind its a selfish egotistical act that allows somebody wholly remarkable to leave his pissstain on the world to prove he existed its been shown over and over that wellworn unmaintained vandalized schools foster a spirit of uncaring in students who feel less connected and in turn show a lack of respect for the campus his advice though about life in general we can reasonably assume applies to vandalism goes against that theres so many things he could have done to really help children like donating money or school supplies making a scholarship for young artists etc his effort here is just worthless irresponsible shit i wish he used his notoriety for good instead of ego masturbation
UpliftingNews,removed,this a repost
UpliftingNews,removed,only a matter of time til he gets robbed or killed
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck banksy fuck street art
UpliftingNews,removed,and hes been robbed how many times

UpliftingNews,removed,fuck trump and fuck white people
UpliftingNews,removed,good the owner can let all the refugees stay at his house and hope he does not get robbed blind
UpliftingNews,removed,i love private sector solutions i am sure they will vett people before placing them in hosts home

UpliftingNews,removed,as much as left wingers hate to hear it theres no such thing as free
UpliftingNews,removed,this belongs in rfakenews
UpliftingNews,removed,doesnt seem fair to me housing in my area is obscene per month to live in the ghetto with meth heads in the street to be safe and some lucky immigrants are going to get free room and board presumably for the foreseeable future because of their legal status likely in a nicer neighborhood than mine
UpliftingNews,removed,im saddened by the news free roand board woohoo
UpliftingNews,removed,please follow the hive mind
UpliftingNews,removed,yes and the owners as maids
UpliftingNews,removed,and can they let the refugees stay in the master while the owner washes their feet preferably while getting spit on for living a haram lifestyle

UpliftingNews,removed,so breaking the law is uplifting news now jesus christ
UpliftingNews,removed,not in my house
UpliftingNews,removed,wait if they had all this housing why dont they just offer it as a rental service to begin with instead of conning people into subletting their homes oh oh its an empty promise for social media pr nevermind
UpliftingNews,removed,airbnb come for the free roomstay for the suicide bombing
UpliftingNews,removed,thats okay his middle name is hussein so it isnt racist
UpliftingNews,removed,that ought to work out well
UpliftingNews,removed,not only are you overly cynical not only are you choosing to spread hate and mistrust but youre also colossally wrong in possibly the stupidest way i just really cannot stand people who are as dumb as you who actually think they are some how smart ones in the conversation
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah so fuck em
UpliftingNews,removed,take a wild guess idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,they have some place to go right the fuck back where they came from

UpliftingNews,removed,you cant be stupid enough to ask this question seriously can you
UpliftingNews,removed,chance letting any refugee stay in my property airbnb can go fuck themselves
UpliftingNews,removed,lol got to love how rupliftingnews has turned into rupliftingnewsfortheleft
UpliftingNews,removed,you talk like a fag and your shits all retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,do they require documentation because im pretty sure i was affected and could use a free place to stay in hawaii
UpliftingNews,removed,ugly cuck
UpliftingNews,removed,offer housing to the homeless oh wait there that isnt politically expedient
UpliftingNews,removed,the top countries by muslim population arent on the list if this was a muslim ban wouldnt the top countries with the most muslims be on the ban list the fear mongering and hysteria is out of control calling it a muslim ban is false at best and an outright lie at worst
UpliftingNews,removed,theres a civil war going on in iran are you stupid or did you just confuse iran with syria
UpliftingNews,removed,hey how about those homeless people in america fuck em right
UpliftingNews,removed,this is dumb as shit

UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile over in rthedonald those wonderful folks are calling to barring this judge some great leader weve got sure brings out the best in people
UpliftingNews,removed,so many people taking opportunities for free press shit on donald trump and get more business at the same time
UpliftingNews,removed,well a liberal wanker is spouting bullshit that makes other liberal wankers feel good about themselves also if hes being serious hes enacting a corporate policy that is damaging to the country that he belongs to souplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,did you try not talking like a fag
UpliftingNews,removed,homeless programs in los angeles they paid dollars tax deductible and got a fullpage advert in the la times i would call that a marketing win it is good that they donated to the program but why not shut up about it do you really think that corporations are merciful entities i though the left was against seeing corporations as people
UpliftingNews,removed,corporation no matter how hard they try is a detriment to mankind
UpliftingNews,removed,what a cuck fuck airbnb
UpliftingNews,removed,i think the difference is that the majority of the left feels that the people who want this ban are primarily motivated by fear that may have some logical origin but has evolved completely beyond the point of rationality into what is essentially a mistrust of all people from the middle east that is why they are upset about it now when they werent before you may disagree but i think its important to understand where theyre coming from even if you feel that they are delusional they think the same thing about you after all and youre presumably not a lunatic right
UpliftingNews,removed,youre a legit fucking idiot if you dont understand that airbnb can pay the owners of houses in their network
UpliftingNews,removed,so youre saying those who were banned in were unaffected which is why airbnb didnt offer them housing
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah the stupid media calling it a muslim ban i wonder who in the world could have given them that idea shut your fucking retarded mouth
UpliftingNews,removed,send all muslim migrants in europe to airbnbs
UpliftingNews,removed,you dont seem to get out of your basement too often
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah no plans except for the aca and medicaid and every other government program to help the needy like food stamps and all the shit you probably bitch about every other day you fucking idiot cunt
UpliftingNews,removed,helping out the us now those refugees can go somewhere else for housing its not our responsibility to take care of the world
UpliftingNews,removed,if you think this is out of the good of airbnbs heart you might be retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,will airbnb screen individuals for domestic violence sexual assaults honor killings subjecting women and girls to inferior status
UpliftingNews,removed,cringe
UpliftingNews,removed,wow you are racist because the homeless people in the us are just lazy out of work right wingers we should open our hearts and homes to the year old single male refugees from the middle east
UpliftingNews,removed,uremindme minutes do i care yet
UpliftingNews,removed,islam isnt a race
UpliftingNews,removed,reddit is one massive cringe fest today
UpliftingNews,removed,i am also a business consultant and marketing specialist this is a really good thing theyre doing trump only deports people deported because theyre wahhabist which is code word for believing in a different god or being gay he cant divide us
UpliftingNews,removed,the only thing that is controversial is trumps policies banning muslims and gays from entering the us for racist reasons and deporting people already here its are you kidding me
UpliftingNews,removed,which is so crazy just because someone has religious differences and they believe in islam or whatever we wont invite them to our country our nation is built on immigration just because someone is a wahhabist muslim we wont allow them to our country its
UpliftingNews,removed,what if a homeowner involved with airbnb doesnt want a potential terrorist staying at their place
UpliftingNews,removed,before the ban how many refugees has he offered to let live at his personal residence
UpliftingNews,removed,why would the ceo support the housing of sleeper cells in my home this is disgusting 🤔🇺🇸
UpliftingNews,removed,completely immaterial of its a pr move i am a marketing analyst at a fortune company and i can assure you very often corporations only make decisions like this based on the greater good and not shareholder needs in cases like this believe it or not profit isnt the main motivator its kind of interesting if you look at humanitarian disasters and such corporations are often far more successful than governments in providing aid trumps ban on muslims is unconscionable thanks be to allah i identify as queermuslim fyi there are brave multinational corporations who will fight back

UpliftingNews,removed,i prefer my alternative facts thanks
UpliftingNews,removed,the sub mods should be aware that this subject is super hyper political right now and that theres a substantial portion of the populace that does not see this as uplifting at all rather they see a hackneyed capitalization on current strife i detest this administrations current positions on immigration and safe harbor but i also detest blind naivete andor onesided rhetoric pretending to be innocent goodwill this thread should not be in this thread at all due to its obvious potential to inflame disagreement disappointed in whoever posted it here
UpliftingNews,removed,it is insane i heard about it on npr yesterday among the many things trump has done he is banning gay muslims specifically from entering the us and forcing people not to get abortions scary times indeed to call oneself a transgendered muslimamerican
UpliftingNews,removed,you have no point resort to bully tactics congratulations
UpliftingNews,removed,yaaaas then issue a claim notice to the us government for lost costs wages profit and put some goddamned interest on the investment you made fuck why hasnt this been thought of before
UpliftingNews,removed,these people sound like trump supporters we should continue to publicly shame or punish them here that would be quite uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,they hold back our path to socialism
UpliftingNews,removed,how stoked were you when you got the username uupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,removed,screaming altright at the first sign so youre just a regressiveleft liberal schill you should open with that

UpliftingNews,removed,no worries mate it is a very tense time right now it seems like half of america is having nonvoting regret and forgets that they made trump the worse part is they are blind to the fact that this president isnt a whole lot different than the last president and for the record ive voted thirdparty for the past years
UpliftingNews,removed,it isnt but they arent going to let the facts get in the way they think trump is banning muslims from middle eastern countries because they may be terrorists airbnb is supporting the people that are banned by giving them free places to stay that means airbnb is supporting terrorists

UpliftingNews,removed,not so fast not so furious
UpliftingNews,removed,not to burst your bubble but research shows that around of muslims are fall under the title of islamist essentially thats the belief system that you want to implement some for of religious law but through the confines of the current system things like jailing charlie hebdo would of been strictly legal in the case that they had their way its important to realize that these people are out there and there is nearly million of them this isnt isis of course they are nonviolent by definition but its a bit of a stretch to say that it is a small amount
UpliftingNews,removed,itt people being shitstains
UpliftingNews,removed,its nice theyre realizing how meaningless their stupid religion of violence is but downvoted nonetheless because muslim
UpliftingNews,removed,is the first pillar bringing death destruction upon the world and the infidels

UpliftingNews,removed,to people posting that factsheet about how most muslims want sharia and tons support suicide bombers etc the numbers dont match up with the official pew report dont know where that fact sheet came from but it seems that it very selectively interpreted pew to say the least
UpliftingNews,removed,fasting is unhealthy and controlling someones diet is step in brain washing mind control

UpliftingNews,removed,omg no white people are going to turn on us we need to show that were not fucked up lets donate blood oh but were still going to turn a blind eye when our muslim neighbors says crazy shit until one day he goes on a rampage
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah so tell the people of rlgbt that muslims who are gay should suppress their urges
UpliftingNews,removed,you know tell us how you know that most muslims are kind people because by every survey done its clear that most muslims approve of stoning for adultery disapprove of homosexuality support sharia law etc etc etc ad nauseum
UpliftingNews,removed,jihad is also a pillar of islam
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure its not intended but that title sounds almost gleeful as if the whole community have distanced themselves from islam now and become normal charitable people
UpliftingNews,removed,just like they push their antichristian garbage as well but thats just fine right
UpliftingNews,removed,a muslim community just to be clear its a group from detroit
UpliftingNews,removed,no amount of blood donations will save them

UpliftingNews,removed,no he didnt the greeks and chinese and i think assyrians a thousand years earlier had systems for providing pensions and retirement funds for soldiers and others as well as payments to help the poor in some cases muhammad was a brilliant military tactician but is biggest invention is the mishmash of religious doctrines he tossed together and called islam
UpliftingNews,removed,look at this kafir doesnt even know about taqiyya propaganda
UpliftingNews,removed,u liberals need to stop posting this bullshit after an attack to explain away why muslims hate gay people

UpliftingNews,removed,breaking an hour fast tragic
UpliftingNews,removed,the peace and love of the quran right about that quran and kill them wherever you find them and turn them out from where they have turned you out and alfitnah is worse than killing but if they desist then lo allah is forgiving and merciful and fight them until there is no more fitnah and worship is for allah alone but if they cease let there be no transgression except against azzalimunthe polytheists and wrongdoers etc translation is from the noble quran the verse prior to this refers to fighting for the cause of allah those who fight you leading some to believe that the entire passage refers to a defensive war in which muslims are defending their homes and families the historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare however since muhammad and his muslims had just relocated to medina and were not under attack by their meccan adversaries in fact the verses urge offensive warfare in that muslims are to drive meccans out of their own city which they later did verse thus means to fight those who offer resistance to allahs rule ie muslim conquest the use of the word persecution by some muslim translators is disingenuous the actual arabic words for persecution idtihad and oppression a variation of zlm do not appear in the verse the word used instead fitna can mean disbelief or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation this is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned until religion is for allah ie unbelievers desist in their unbelief quran then fight in the cause of allah and know that allah heareth and knoweth all things quran fighting is prescribed for you and ye dislike it but it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you and that ye love a thing which is bad for you but allah knoweth and ye know not not only does this verse establish that violence can be virtuous but it also contradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in selfdefense since the audience was obviously not under attack at the time from the hadith we know that this verse was narrated at a time that muhammad was actually trying to motivate his people into raiding merchant caravans for loot quran as to those who reject faith i will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the hereafter nor will they have anyone to help quran soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers for that they joined companions with allah for which he had sent no authority this speaks directly of polytheists yet it also includes christians since they believe in the trinity ie what muhammad incorrectly believed to be joining companions to allah quran let those fight in the way of allah who sell the life of this world for the other whoso fighteth in the way of allah be he slain or be he victorious on him we shall bestow a vast reward the martyrs of islam are unlike the early christians who were led meekly to the slaughter these muslims are killed in battle as they attempt to inflict death and destruction for the cause of allah this is the theological basis for todays suicide bombers quran those who believe fight in the cause of allah quran they but wish that ye should reject faith as they do and thus be on the same footing as they but take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of allah from what is forbidden but if they turn renegades seize them and slay them wherever ye find them and in any case take no friends or helpers from their ranks quran not equal are those of the believers who sit at home except those who are disabled by injury or are blind or lame etc and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of allah with their wealth and their lives allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit at homeunto each allah has promised good paradise but allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight above those who sit at home by a huge reward this passage criticizes peaceful muslims who do not join in the violence letting them know that they are less worthy in allahs eyes it also demolishes the modern myth that jihad doesnt mean holy war in the quran but rather a spiritual struggle not only is this arabic word mujahiduna used in this passage but it is clearly not referring to anything spiritual since the physically disabled are given exemption the hadith reveals the context of the passage to be in response to a blind mans protest that he is unable to engage in jihad which would not make sense if it meant an internal struggle quran and be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy if you suffer pain then surely they too suffer pain as you suffer pain is pursuing an injured and retreating enemy really an act of selfdefense quran the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement quran i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them no reasonable person would interpret this to mean a spiritual struggle quran o ye who believe when ye meet those who disbelieve in battle turn not your backs to them on that day turneth his back to them unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company he truly hath incurred wrath from allah and his habitation will be hell a hapless journeys end quran and fight with them until there is no more fitna disorder unbelief and religion is all for allah some translations interpret fitna as persecution but the traditional understanding of this word is not supported by the historical context see notes for the meccans were simply refusing muhammad access to their city during haj other muslims were allowed to travel there just not as an armed group since muhammad had declared war on mecca prior to his eviction the meccans were also acting in defense of their religion since it was muhammads intention to destroy their idols and establish islam by force which he later did hence the critical part of this verse is to fight until religion is only for allah meaning that the true justification of violence was the unbelief of the opposition according to the sira ibn ishaqhisham muhammad further explains that allah must have no rivals quran if thou comest on them in the war deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them that haply they may remember quran it is not for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he had made a great slaughter in the land quran and let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip allahs purpose lo they cannot escape make ready for them all thou canst of armed force and of horses tethered that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of allah and your enemy quran o prophet exhort the believers to fight quran so when the sacred months have passed away then slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate leave their way free to them according to this verse the best way of staying safe from muslim violence is to convert to islam prayer salat and the poor tax zakat are among the religions five pillars this popular claim that the quran only inspires violence within the context of selfdefense is seriously challenged by this passage as well since the muslims to whom it was written were obviously not under attack had they been then there would have been no waiting period earlier verses make it a duty for muslims to fight in selfdefense even during the sacred months the historical context is mecca after the idolaters were subjugated by muhammad and posed no threat once the muslims had power they violently evicted those unbelievers who would not convert quran fight against them so that allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people humiliating and hurting nonbelievers not only has the blessing of allah but it is ordered as a means of carrying out his punishment and even healing the hearts of muslims quran those who believe and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in allahs way are of much greater worth in allahs sight these are they who are triumphant the arabic word interpreted as striving in this verse is the same root as jihad the context is obviously holy war more continued in next comment
UpliftingNews,removed,i see the new reddit algorithm is blocking all donald posts and pushing all promuslim propaganda orwell would be proud
UpliftingNews,removed,are rape murder beheadings and ethnic cleansing the other four

UpliftingNews,removed,heres some nonuplifting muslim news they have a gigantic base of radicals who hate you hate women hate gays hate christians hate jews and are actively plotting largescale attacks on westernized countries
UpliftingNews,removed,the rule of taquiya says that they are allowed to break fast if its a tactic to spread lies about islam being a tolerant and peaceful religion or if its a tactic that can help them wage jihad
UpliftingNews,removed,its a really terrible ideology followed by majority a of people who are decent human beings there is nothing good offered by islam to the world i say this as someone who followed sunni islam for years and comes from a muslim family the individual followers may be hard working and peaceful people but to me their faith will forever be a rabid dog in a cage the liberal muslims that follow a neutered version of the faith will always be a minority i find these followers to much worse since the media and society will put them on a spotlight thinking islam is progressive and has no problems when in reality the majority of the followers will still have problematic beliefs that the west will consider extreme
UpliftingNews,removed,or you could not belong to stupid religion that makes you deny your basic need food

UpliftingNews,removed,look goyim muslims doing some nice things keep those borders open nothing to worry about
UpliftingNews,removed,christianity is just as violent as islam
UpliftingNews,removed,wtf is the point of fasting please tell me who this helps and how
UpliftingNews,removed,islam is the reason gays died
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck islam
UpliftingNews,removed,i think your forgetting a pillar aka jihad
UpliftingNews,removed,this is bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,as they say one swallow doesnt make a summer
UpliftingNews,removed,wow muslims really are such great people im great you made this post that is all about trying to convince everyone that muslims are not all terrorists
UpliftingNews,removed,they got what they deserved
UpliftingNews,removed,theres no such thing as islamophobia
UpliftingNews,removed,if i was an orlando victim i think i would pass on the muslim blood
UpliftingNews,removed,your all disgusting praising supporting defending islam a few days after the pulse massacre islam will not change whilstit is being protected like it is i hope you all meet the real islam like those in pulse did fucking disgusting this is not about muslims its about the twisted ideology they follow and you all support
UpliftingNews,removed,you expect these sjw liberal cunts to knowbelieve that they blindly support islam and its twisted ideology theuy know nothing about the very thing they blindly defend its all about pc points to the left wing sjw islamists
UpliftingNews,removed,christianity has evolved and reformed since then nobody reads the bible so literally except some africans but muslims take the kuran and sharia as they are gods word and dont accept anything else
UpliftingNews,removed,who cares
UpliftingNews,removed,the quran says to kill apostates im having it ban islam protect gay people and all nonmuslims
UpliftingNews,removed,you would be killed in a muslim country for not obeying the fast just month ago a women in a restaurant in france was attacked for serving alchohol by muslim men ban islam for our safety
UpliftingNews,removed,their warlord pefdophile prophet
UpliftingNews,removed,palestinians are the aggressors they deserve to die all of those dick suckers were americans and are better than palestinians i think their way of life is gross and a sin but thats not my business i would use my second amendment right to defend their freedom to be gross muslims are a cancer that need to be eradicated or quarantined to the dessert from where their filthy ideology came from im guessing youre one of them if you are know that you arent welcomed anywhere nobody wants you around your religion breeds violence and is incompatible with the civilized world please die soon without reproducing
UpliftingNews,removed,you should check out rexmuslim to show you the true evils of islam and the lies the media tell you
UpliftingNews,removed,islamophobia implies there is an irrational fear of muslims what exactly is irrational about fearing a religion based on subjugation of women execution of homosexuals and violence towards nonbelievers
UpliftingNews,removed,the quran says to kill nonmuslims so ya it is the enemy
UpliftingNews,removed,before praying a muslim male or female has to be clean muslims must perform wudu a way of cleaning oneself before prayer if you pee poop or do something else considered dirty after wudu then it is broken and you have to redo the wudu in order to pray during a womens period she can not perform the wudu without breaking it immediately it in no way counts against her it is not missing prayers and she does not have to make them up later as one normally would this absurdity demonstrates cognitive dissonance akin to a dd game hosted by a year old dungeon master making up the rules repeatedly review the paragraph above until the lightbulb of rediculousness flickers on
UpliftingNews,removed,yes they can buddhism hinduism if anyone from those religions has any hate its coming from within them
UpliftingNews,removed,another fluff piece to coddle the religion of death
UpliftingNews,removed,awwwyou mean muslims are doing what normal people do every day lets praise them for it endlessly and ignore the fact that in the koran they call nonmuslims subhuman and call for their death religionofpeace notallmuslims youaintmuslimbruv stickyourheadinthesand ohmygodtheyrekillingus stopshootingmeplz plzdontcutmyheadoff allaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
UpliftingNews,removed,what stage is muslim treatment of non muslims at
UpliftingNews,removed,or islam could have just not shot all those gay people that would have also been cool
UpliftingNews,removed,not pure may seem loaded but it is in fact the way women are viewed through the quran
UpliftingNews,removed,annnnd half want you dead
UpliftingNews,removed,am comm but had been assigned to plenty of mxsf units for my deployments
UpliftingNews,removed,its okay you need us more than we need you
UpliftingNews,removed,so many salty islamophobes in this thread
UpliftingNews,removed,poor thing hit a negative blooty and jessop jessop jessop
UpliftingNews,removed,realistically it doesnt matter now does it
UpliftingNews,removed,well maybe someone wanted to give something that suffered a good life because they cared
UpliftingNews,removed,for a second i thought this was rcirclejerk
UpliftingNews,removed,that dog does not look clean and sober he looks high as fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,gonna be like this once trump is elected everyone get on board now
UpliftingNews,removed,go home cleveland youre drunk
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont see this as uplifting at all not trying to be a dick but theres too many homeless people even veterans just to fund money to people who already have money support of others unions and pentionswork its understandable if family needs cash assistance but come on ban me if you want this is as uplifting as giving money to nestle
UpliftingNews,removed,the families of the police officers get pension and life insurance benefits why doesnt she raise money for poor black kids instead
UpliftingNews,removed,fun times in cleveland todayyy
UpliftingNews,removed,sooo full disclosure here most of cleveland always looks like a riot has just went through it up to and including the burned out buildings its not like a riot could really make things much worse
UpliftingNews,removed,even the ultraliberal washington post finds it news worthy that cleveland isnt rioting jesus
UpliftingNews,removed,why hold events like this in the first place seems like inviting the mentally ill out
UpliftingNews,removed,sometimes i has flairs of autism combined with a mini stroke my b
UpliftingNews,removed,just goes to show its up to the antitrump protesters the people going there to listen to trump rarely if ever stir shit up to the point of violence the liberal media was praying for riots so that they could point their fingers at the hate again fucking pathetic just surrender to potus donald j trump already
UpliftingNews,removed,its pathetic when its forced though you can tell when it is and when it isnt i didnt have any issues with that picture but when you see it in some hyundai commercial where theres like best buddies and one of them has to be black its cringeworthy not that they couldnt possibly have a black guy there but for most commercials you can just tell how forced it is
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel like these are the options for a child either riot or throw a party i feel like were doing everything as a country to not have to admit the points the other side have and engaging in constructive criticism and debatediscussion learning how to stay passionate and engaged as well a civil sure its a feelgood story in contrast to rioting but there are important things going on and issues boiling under the surface that we could be learning to engage in do we have to accept that low bar for a good and disireable reaction having a party during these national events to keep from rioting we should be learning to exist somewhere in between the choices of extreme polar opposites offered to us by the media in contrast this seems like a fingersintheears nonsolution everyone seems to be calling the other side uninformed idiots and its popular to proclaim loudly that we just cant fathom how the other side could possibly hold the views they do have we really become that blind that each side honestly believes theyre the only rational ones and that the other half of the country has literally lost their reason sure have your party thats all well and good but let me know when you can defend your opposition on their terms before you proclaim to dismantle it that would be uplifting news for sure
UpliftingNews,removed,white cop shot at a black bruh pillage the city loot everything
UpliftingNews,removed,why wasnt i invited three quesiton marks ok good period here now say whats the difference between a male and a turtle a male knows where his dick is and turtle knows how to fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,for any other cause they would shut it down
UpliftingNews,removed,there should be a lemonade shop opened for mental health therapists who take police bullets for their patients
UpliftingNews,removed,dont they get a fat pension anyway
UpliftingNews,removed,but whyyy its un to call white people niggers and black people caucastians becase in the endd well yo only get called what you were called
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile there are hundreds of blm activists calling for cops and white people to get killed
UpliftingNews,removed,i think you replied to the wrong comment
UpliftingNews,removed,i think it hasnt been the rnc events that turned into shit shows but the insanely militant protesters outside the events that have turned everything to shit
UpliftingNews,removed,shockingly no violent protests in the city full of republicans who is taking bets that the democrats town will be full on race war
UpliftingNews,removed,i know early on the democrat protesters were burning american flags so maybe someone lit themselves on fire
UpliftingNews,removed,pleasedontburnmycitydown pleasedontburnmycitydown pleasedontburnmycitydown pleasedontburnmycitydownpleasedontburnmycitydown pleasedontburnmycitydownpleasedontburnmycitydown pleasedontburnmycitydown
UpliftingNews,removed,or the part where he mentions the people partying are trump supporters yet tries to smear the republican base anyway
UpliftingNews,removed,didnt the kkk and the westburo church have a urine party
UpliftingNews,removed,they were then arrested for operating a business without a license and tax evasion
UpliftingNews,removed,it seems that the extreme racists havent made it to cleveland yet
UpliftingNews,removed,i was thinking the city might be the cunt and shut down the stand like some others i seen from time to time but glad they seems to be ok with running
UpliftingNews,removed,whats going on is that an armed society is a polite society kinda hard for antifa to know who to target for assault when they dont know if they could blast them away ohio has open and concealed carry laws dont worry philly is going to be a fucking mess blm is actually going to be celebrated and lauded inside while they destroy outside
UpliftingNews,removed,wait until they start taxing it
UpliftingNews,removed,the trump speech was the best ive seen yet gotta give the guy credit its hitting all the right buttons i will be voting for trump
UpliftingNews,removed,trump already is making america great again
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre not doing something good theyre raising money for the members of a domestic terrorist organization instead of the families of the innocents theyve murdered the parents should be ashamed of themselves for allowing it and not teaching their kids about the reality of the situation
UpliftingNews,removed,trump the great uniter
UpliftingNews,removed,its a bit of a domestic terrorist organization instead of the kids is named landry
UpliftingNews,removed,the whole summer of rage was a giant bust the cleveland police did a great job but also the protesters just didnt show up if you are too lazy for a job chances are you are too lazy for a sustained protest
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck the police all of them
UpliftingNews,removed,wheres her zoning permit
UpliftingNews,removed,did those kids have a fucking permit we need to be sure of health concerns and that the government got their cut murica
UpliftingNews,removed,dont worry cleveland blm will make sure to fuck this up
UpliftingNews,removed,while skimming through the article i saw an excerpt of a protestor yelling blue lives murder not to be racist but look at the facts black murderers are on par with white murderers in the us a little less to be slightly more exact even though there are far more white people you cant yell shit like that when the data shows your race assuming the person who yelled that was black is more violent not all black people are violent and not all coos are murderers or racist but looking at the data alone more black people are shooting other people than white people are
UpliftingNews,removed,dont worry cleveland still had riots people were spraying police with urine filled water guns and stabbing them with syringes
UpliftingNews,removed,this wont change anything racism doesnt go away in shows of rainbows and balloons its a painful process that took someone like me an everyday american with a relatively normal life about solid years to actually uproot the energy may be jovial but that line of thinking will stay especially when it is so casually reinforced in american politics media etc
UpliftingNews,removed,well only the democrats promised riots so theres that
UpliftingNews,removed,its cause the rnc fans arent protesting there wait until the dnc where theyll be be in full crazed force
UpliftingNews,removed,open carry
UpliftingNews,removed,they were communists obviously couldnt handle the red
UpliftingNews,removed,trump bringing people together already
UpliftingNews,removed,we got a block party instead
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont understand why one would raise money for families that will be taken care of by the govt cops families are well taken care of they dont deserve any extra money in my opinion all they do is tax civilians and solve petty crimes
UpliftingNews,removed,ending racism would only benifit black people and other self loathing races when are black people going to grow up
UpliftingNews,removed,honest question i know trump said some stupid crap about a hispanic judge and got jumped on about a remark about illegal immigrants but i dont think hes said anything that could even be creatively construed as racist outside of that has he i just feel like calling everyone racist is lazy especially against someone like trump who has so many more legitimate things to hit him on
UpliftingNews,removed,call me crazy but i think it has more to do with thousands of armed bikers protecting the event
UpliftingNews,removed,lemonade lives matter
UpliftingNews,removed,the worst part is the wash dc branch of blm denouncing this good faith effort ugh that is a perfect of example of why we cannot have nice things
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe they should use that money to set up a fund to defend inevitable future lawsuits regarding the shooting of innocent unarmed civilians yes im a cynic
UpliftingNews,removed,the cops couldnt raise the money themselves via aggressive traffic stops example pulling people over for going mph over the speed limit thats what they do in california
UpliftingNews,removed,thats nothing she failed
UpliftingNews,removed,why cant they donate to the blm what are they racist blm should protest in front of the lemonade stand right now this is a travesty also the lemonade it too white the need to add some color to it s
UpliftingNews,removed,wow guess this is the one way to not get your lemonade stand shut down in a red state
UpliftingNews,removed,yeaaaaah were gonna need to see your documents and sales records
UpliftingNews,removed,nice gesture but we shouldnt be encouraging supporting these people until the all havent spoken out against the racism and violence within the police force
UpliftingNews,removed,it would be nice if that happened but no laws are applied discriminately
UpliftingNews,removed,i love how there is a trump shop right behind them to hell with him stop racism
UpliftingNews,removed,when police questioned them about their license to operate shots were fired killing both girls police said it was self defense
UpliftingNews,removed,what was the comment did it really deserve to be removed it probably would have gotten downvoted im interested to know what problem people could have had with this i suppose they think money shouldnt be donated to racist evil cops families
UpliftingNews,removed,through civil forfeiture or a straight up donation
UpliftingNews,removed,think she is selling more than lemonade
UpliftingNews,removed,at least two of the kids in those pictures go to httpwwwhockadayorg i suspect the donations were significantly boosted by wealthy parents
UpliftingNews,removed,confiscated the profits and fined them each extra dough
UpliftingNews,removed,got some drugs here for sale dont worry the proceeds go to fallen officers so its legit
UpliftingNews,removed,lol cops condoning illegal unlicensed businesses as long as they get the profit
UpliftingNews,removed,so whats the vig
UpliftingNews,removed,just like a clinton charity anyway
UpliftingNews,removed,president trump is already making a positive impact and hes not even in office yet this guy doesnt take any shit and the protesters only have a few months left before its going to get real expensive to be lawless
UpliftingNews,removed,more contributions to the pigs in blankets foundation
UpliftingNews,removed,kinda thought the next line was going to be dallas police then shut down the lemonade stand as they did not have the required food service permits
UpliftingNews,removed,we should do this for the cop who shot the caretaker for the autistic lad hes gonna need some spare change for his vacation
UpliftingNews,removed,proceeds of crime
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope she got a permit or do we selective choose to not enforce it in this case because cops benefit
UpliftingNews,removed,see police wont threaten all children with lemonaid stands you just have to give them a cut of the action fuck the police
UpliftingNews,removed,normally the police shut these down because of lack of permit i guess since it was being donated to the police its ok funny how that works
UpliftingNews,removed,open that shit back up kids
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting the families are well taken care of what a fucking shitlord
UpliftingNews,removed,surprising the cops didnt shut them down for not having a vendors license like they normally do
UpliftingNews,removed,then they get hit with a peddlers fine
UpliftingNews,removed,though you cant just group everyone up ive got two answers to that the first being the tendency of police to circle the wagons when one of their own winds up in trouble no matter how justified that trouble the second being the existence of crappy laws the longer a cop is a cop the probability of them being called on them to enforce an unjust or immoral law approaches anyone who becomes a cop knowing that doesnt deserve to be one
UpliftingNews,removed,wwwgooglecom
UpliftingNews,removed,dont worry cucks are loud youre point is not hard to grasp but theyre trying to spin it the other way youre saying protect yourself by avoiding drunk women because who knows what theyll do when they sober up and sadly thats becoming more and more of the case even if you have her shouting yes out the window during the act theyre trying to say better still dont be a predator which really has nothing to do with what youre saying at all welcome to posttruth my friend
UpliftingNews,removed,am i the only one who may think that this dude is a creep and a voyeur and may be in for some granny sex
UpliftingNews,removed,oh so people who do not care for their manipulative abusive nasty parentsgrandparents are horrible people nope age is no excuse if you constantly rob people who are trying to love and care for you of their humanity do not expect human dignity and respect in return not all old people are good sorry this feel good shit is tainted and ignores some nasty realities
UpliftingNews,removed,and all he asks in return is one gum job a week and that social security check
UpliftingNews,removed,am i too late to start the thread that speculates over whether or not he has an old person fetish
UpliftingNews,removed,hes into gilfs
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe e is doing it for the chance at being added into the will
UpliftingNews,removed,im not american and stop killing west papuan indo dog
UpliftingNews,removed,gold digger

UpliftingNews,removed,hes either trying to set himself up for a book deal or he has a weird old lady fetish nobody is this altruistici dont but it
UpliftingNews,removed,step one get a sharpie step two eyebrows
UpliftingNews,removed,these guys left her an enormous tip because shes black and then claim her race doesnt matter white guilt at its finest
UpliftingNews,removed,step four more sharpies
UpliftingNews,removed,so she went on a march against trump but trump supporters were the bigger person and tipped her huge hmmm i wonder what that says about her
UpliftingNews,removed,because its pretty fucking racist identity politics is fucking scum thats why
UpliftingNews,removed,acknowledging race when race doesnt fucking matter god damn is racist oh look here is this black person who has a new job congratulations paul on the job
UpliftingNews,removed,if i virtue signal enough then i will earn enough nice guy points and a liberal internet female will let me touch her boob hopefully
UpliftingNews,removed,must be nice until you have to wash her
UpliftingNews,removed,oh no the retards have found this post
UpliftingNews,removed,one nice tip makes all the racism go away huh i love how you conservative fascists can smell whats coming for you enjoy your rampage while it lasts
UpliftingNews,removed,not being a racist yourself is of no value when youve paved the way for one to legislate his xenophobia and hatred into law the world is full of precious rain drops who dont think theyre responsible for the flood
UpliftingNews,removed,of course they wore their cowboy hats to a restaurant in dc they wonder why they cant get jobs id hire a mexican over a red neck any day
UpliftingNews,removed,us white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white blackus white black

UpliftingNews,removed,why are you being such a dick over one wrong word do they not teach manners in kindergarten anymore
UpliftingNews,removed,well when a hipster is kicked out of his parents home and wont get a job this is a viable option
UpliftingNews,removed,found the sjw in the article it reeks of all lives matter and colorblind sentiments wont make systemic oppression go away good to see you americans getting g along just dont credit god it takes human effort to be human not god
UpliftingNews,removed,of course not the only person we know for sure that represents all of those things is trump
UpliftingNews,removed,learn your laws and statistics most of the people who stay here came here legally by plane and just overstaying their allowed period thats not a crime google it dumbshit
UpliftingNews,removed,go tell your friends about that lets see if you still have any unless youre in some alabama shithole of course
UpliftingNews,removed,designated
UpliftingNews,removed,i certainly hope condoms arent made of plastic there
UpliftingNews,removed,how about those toilets though
UpliftingNews,removed,lol what a horrible person
UpliftingNews,removed,yet libtards are still doing everything they can to ignore any proof of how the environment is getting better not worse
UpliftingNews,removed,perhaps they can take care of all tgose dead bodies littering the rivers one could say theyre on top of the water
UpliftingNews,removed,have you seen indian cities this is not so much being on top of it as it is things have gotten so insanely filthy that we absolutely have to do something about it because this entire city is more garbage than people
UpliftingNews,removed,cnn contributor here sorry not allowed to post feelgood stuff like this doesnt fit with the race war we are trying to start
UpliftingNews,removed,i always wonder why this hole in ozone layer is in the south pole and southern hemisphere where there is so little pollution or industrialization you would think the north pole would have this problem they are not telling you something
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope it is more successful than the ban on public defecation
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure there is laws against rape yet the cops be rapin
UpliftingNews,removed,ima here for da heritage golddiggin numale
UpliftingNews,removed,ya know on the one hand its really shitty and shady on the other hand im sure extracting bribes form tourists and semiwealthy indians is quite profitable
UpliftingNews,removed,i have no intention of replying to a ridiculously stupid point anymore than this comment
UpliftingNews,removed,no you delude yourself because you cant accept your ineptitude but were done here you dont really have any sense so ill have mercy and let you skulk away silently
UpliftingNews,removed,now if they would stop shitting all over the place and use a toilet
UpliftingNews,removed,now maybe they can ban shitting in the streets
UpliftingNews,removed,should ban shitting in the streets
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this country just soawful
UpliftingNews,removed,cool now the people who live in garbage dumps will suffer the consequences of our one earths collective futile desires
UpliftingNews,removed,now they just need to ban shitting in the street and theyll be half civilised
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah now if they could just get the gang raping women in alleys and shitting on the streets thing under control
UpliftingNews,removed,lol libtards have no arguments so they have to call everyone a nazi
UpliftingNews,removed,what about nondisposable plastics

UpliftingNews,removed,educate as many people as you can and stop muslims from fucking marrying more than once and breed like pigs indian here
UpliftingNews,removed,ffs why
UpliftingNews,removed,well they already drink eachothers piss why not eat eachothers shit
UpliftingNews,removed,i had to tell you how absurd and stupid and simplistic is the idea that a poor country should not invest in technology and research and sciences
UpliftingNews,removed,now if theyd only stop shitting in the street people may go visit
UpliftingNews,removed,because it had nothing to do with the link posted people post absurd comments about toilets everytime anything about india is posted what does a problem a country have anything to do with another completely different positive thing it has done its moronic that you posted that comment
UpliftingNews,removed,what next no designated shitting streets india is changing so fast man
UpliftingNews,removed,now just curb the rapes illiteracy and caste system and they might catch up with the rest of the world
UpliftingNews,removed,what is it with assholes who voted for an out and out bigot and racist that they constantly need to justify their vote we get it you voted for a shitty shitty human being and the decent people in the world dont need your constant whining own the fact you support a vile silly man who is literally violating the laws of this country and who is bought and paid for by a hostile nation youre traitors and no amount of tipping will clear that stink from you
UpliftingNews,removed,do you poo in the loo
UpliftingNews,removed,must have been cluttering up the designated shitting streets
UpliftingNews,removed,go green
UpliftingNews,removed,should pass a law to make it illegal to shit and piss in the streets buncha animals
UpliftingNews,removed,the should ban shitting on the street too
UpliftingNews,removed,lol i was just replying to his comment i didnt know he posted there i do know you posted there which was not surprising
UpliftingNews,removed,i is o
UpliftingNews,removed,i said i have no intention of replying to your comment any more than i did its ok language is hard you are ridiculously simple minded which makes sense countries can focus on multiple things at once space programs bring money as well as furthering development of other technologies
UpliftingNews,removed,any more than this comment how do you breath and walk at the same time
UpliftingNews,removed,a reply worthy of a regular poster to that cancerous subreddit
UpliftingNews,removed,jewppuku
UpliftingNews,removed,youre rebuttal isnt argumentative of anything just seems like youre covering your eyes and ears and going cant hear you daddy trump is good delusional isnt a good look and neither is not having the ability to read or apply critical thinking to simple terms that being said i learned a while ago that you cant change the minds of the willfully and adamantly stupid
UpliftingNews,removed,dude i am not worked up stupid arguments lol you posted an article about toilets from on a news post about banning disposable plastic
UpliftingNews,removed,lol
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe now they can work on discouraging gang rape and they can embrace indoor plumbing
UpliftingNews,removed,now if only theyd poo in loo
UpliftingNews,removed,to be fair yeah trumpsters are known for their fair and balanced views

UpliftingNews,removed,sky news has been promoting sky ocean rescue over the past couple of days they made a minute documentary a plastic tide which is an interesting watch
UpliftingNews,removed,i said it doesnt scale are you seriously trying to make the argument the two are even comparable ask any physcologist which is more stressful on the body between schoolyard bullying and armed service there have been many studies on the phenomenon this weak everybodys equal mentality is one of the reasons why we have such high rates of mental illness in society also lol at the snarky soldier worship comment it is clear you have never provided a service to others beyond that which benefits yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,this sub cant handle the truth it shouldnt be a default sub you all pretend to be kind happy people but you ignore huge segments of people who actually do good because you disagree with them politically
UpliftingNews,removed,this guy
UpliftingNews,removed,oh i responded to the wrong comment im talking about the thread that was shut down for the victim of torture because it became inconvenient to the mods that td donated most of the funds to lionel is a good guy though hes just a little wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,im glad you understood the basic jist of my post but im afraid you wont take my advice will you
UpliftingNews,removed,wow thats clever but at the end of the day like what im guessing most of your life amounts to ultimately futile anyway have fun with your crappy life dude
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,ive never seen animals indoctrinated into liberals this should be interesting
UpliftingNews,removed,its time for clock boy to fuck off

UpliftingNews,removed,if he really wants the dog can he not pay the money himself like id like that stray dog from china will people give me free money so i can its £ not a crazy amount of money
UpliftingNews,removed,i got a dog once i was turning had no gf or real friends so i thought it was be a good idea for emotional health reasons after weeks of having him i realized that they are not that easy to take care of work and chores etc so i never spent much time with him drove to the lake at night one time and let him go i figured nature would take care of him more than i could because its their natural habitat and i figured some jogger or something would find it hope it found a loving home never really thought about it until this post

UpliftingNews,removed,wow are you this guy you seem to know everything about his personality
UpliftingNews,removed,no no they wouldnt if they are going to shoot up a school its obvious that they are not sound of mind there is no thinking in mindless bloodshed
UpliftingNews,removed,i am not a baby boomer i am in my i worked my way through college as well as took out loans i had a job since i was and worked a mediocre job which was definitely not wackarnolds fast food jobs are entry level sure thats fine for a highschool kid but by the time youre put of highschool you should have enough experience to land something better and if you dont well i worked my ass off to go to college so when i was there i made the most of my experience because i understood the value of what i was paying for through the sacrifices i made to do so i value the experience as it helped me to grow up and be an independent man and not a spoiled entitled little shit that takes everything for granted i still remember rolling my eyes and shaking my head at the kids goofing off not paying attention and complaining about the classes there are plenty of options to make continuing education less expensive you can take your core classes at community college you can apply for grants scholarships and loans you can put it off a bit while you save up money university is not the only option and the path chosen needs to be weighed for its worth wheither it will produce any roi is it worth it to drop all that money on a year university perhaps depending on aptitude drive and the path chosen however a good percentage of degrees these days are not worth the paper theyre printed on would spending big money and cdippling debt on university be more valuable than that time spent gaining experience are there other trades that are more economically viable and provide a career path that is lucrative and rewarding certainly if i have kids i will talk them through all of this whenand support them with sound advice but its ultimately their decision if they want to go to college and their responsibility to achieve that goal
UpliftingNews,removed,they banned their use in my county so they wouldnt end up in a landfill all the stores that had them at the register threw them away where they ended up in a landfill instead of buying the reusable bags i bought to take shopping
UpliftingNews,removed,good thing english people are so cheap they need to pass this in asia next
UpliftingNews,removed,yes but can you cross the street without getting your head chopped off by mohammed
UpliftingNews,removed,one of those feel good stories where everybody pats themselves on the back when ii reality it achieved very very little a few facts put it into perspective in total they constituted less than household waste were all biodegradable and had been for a number of years hope bag production was very energy efficient the govs own figures found a green cotton bag had to be used timeswithout washing just to break even sales of less efficient ldpe waste bags have gone up because many carrier bags were reused conveniently no figures collected for sales of ldpe bags for life some colloquial reports suggest they are through the roof
UpliftingNews,removed,id bet the same amount of plastic is being used or something very close plastic trash bag sales went way up i use plastic grocery bags as garbage bags every one of them if suddenly they cost money id either have to pay or by other plastic trash bags so really its just a way for stores and the government to take your money this is not uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,was your family chinese
UpliftingNews,removed,every water plant has a step at the intake called screening where they well use a coarse screen to stop anything of visible size bags paper wood leaves rocks live fish dead fish dead animals car parts ice chests refrigerators sheds dead bodies from getting any further its very efficient as it does almost nothing to slow the flow of the water and leaves the trash in one place where they can scoop it out and put it in a truck and send it to the landfill the proportion of that trash that is plastic bags is as with any other collection of trash theyre found in tiny compared with the other stuff in there any smaller particles that get through are caught by the other ten or twenty filtration and sedimentation steps the water goes through as with the other thousand kinds of random stuff that can be floating in a reservoir or river im paying more in taxes for telecommunication services to keep my internet connection up long enough to explain this to you than ive ever paid for my water company to deal with the plastic grocery bags that have wandered into its water sources
UpliftingNews,removed,this isnt uplifting i love plastic bags this is bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,sort of like the jews on their way to the showers they knew there was no use fighting it thats how we need to do with every law that people dont like beat them down until they know when they try to get up that theyll be beaten like a dog again

UpliftingNews,removed,do his parents become eligible for any typeof survivor pension

UpliftingNews,removed,knowing the other person is scheduled to die upcoming is the ultimate stipulation he doesnt have a kid from a previous marriage he doesnt have a crazy ex girlfriend for her to deal with hes going to die this is just another bullshit feel good story so the families can get some likes on the internet and be on the local news
UpliftingNews,removed,i agree ive been married years and most people are not qualified to be married certainly no one under should ever consider it getting married young made things very difficult for us and for our families we both realize it was a mistake we made it work but you dont want to walk down this road to get to where we are when there is a short cut right over there called mature before you marry
UpliftingNews,removed,ill be honest how the fuck is this uplifting news i get that hes making the most of his situation and im genuinely happy for them sort of and feel terrible about his ordeal but from my perspective a kid i didnt know previously now has bone cancer and marrys his poor sweet gf whos stuck it out with him but lets be honest probably did it out of guilt more than anything but even if thats not the case starting from zero kid dying of bone cancer significantly outweighs marrys high school sweetheart in terms of my sentiment overall after hearing about shit like this
UpliftingNews,removed,patronizingnews at best

UpliftingNews,removed,this certainly is uplifting news i miss the old television programming back when most of the educational stations produced and aired educational materials i grew up with it so its a relief to know this has caught so many peoples interest unfortunately the show doesnt air where i live so i go to my buddies house to watch it this and the science channel are airing all episodes back to back of mythbusters soon nice way to close

UpliftingNews,removed,sorry mr focker but cats suck
UpliftingNews,removed,but mangling a cats paw totally appropriate i hope someone caves your sensitive face in with a baseball bat
UpliftingNews,removed,you too of a gun and put it in your mouth
UpliftingNews,removed,this is exactly what im talking about the holier than thou attitude towards animals and pet ownership where you and your lot would rather steal pets from their owners and put them down than have people own happy and healthy animals just because they dont agree with your philosophies youre disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,you sound like a fucking faggot
UpliftingNews,removed,siberian cat breeder for years why would you breed an overpopulated species for every cat you sell a shelter cat is not adopted and therefore euthanized you should be ashamed of yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,everyones that is defending declawing as a way to get more cats adopted out needs to know this the majority of people who care more about their couch than their pet will get rid of the cat they will get them declawed as a cute kitty the cat will grow up and be your pet but its not that cute little kitten anymore eventually youll get pregnant or money will become tight or the cat will pee on your bed because it has a uti and you care more about your possessions than a living creature so youll drop it off at a shelter after looking for a home for it on facebook there will be thousands of full grown cats in shelters in your county and there are more than enough kittens that no one is gonna want the full grown cat you will have raised a cat to believe he is a loved family member who will spend his last hours freezing in a metal cage and dying alone i know this because my wife and i rescue cats our contract specifically bolds you are not allowed to declaw our rescues of our rescues that are returned to us are declawed people that declaw care less about the pet and more about material possessions i dont give a fuck about your excuse you are a shitty human being if you care more about a couch than your pet and you shouldnt get a pet to begin with most of our returns have arthritis in their paws from the declawing cats do not show pain if your cats are declawed pay attention to what they do with their paws you will probably be able to tell the way they rub their paws when their in pain you now also just put a cat with no way to defend itself in a arena with other clawed cats even cats that like each other will get into scuffles and cats end up learning which cats cant scratch back if you want a cat but dont want to have to deal with it scratching up your furniture you first must learn your a fucking moron who should not own a cat
UpliftingNews,removed,i think one of them would be willing to trade claws for a chance at life i dont thinks cats would really understand an existential question like that to be honest
UpliftingNews,removed,are you sure youd rather live in horrible pain every single day of your life
UpliftingNews,removed,are you fine with laws that prevent you from maiming another human being
UpliftingNews,removed,you maimed an animal for being an animal because it ruined your shitty sheets fuck you
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean what should you do if your cat acts like a cat dont get a fucking cat then
UpliftingNews,removed,that reminds me of the freeway collapse in santa clarita after the northridge quake
UpliftingNews,removed,there are multiple health benefits to neutering and spaying with few to no side effects there is no benefit to declawing zero
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck you

UpliftingNews,removed,eliminates the threat of testicular cancer and helps prevent prostate cancer makes them less aggressive and therefore less likely to fight with other male cats during mating season makes them less likely to want to leaveroam to find a mate reduces unwanted kitten populations
UpliftingNews,removed,its an analogy or maybe it isnt
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile millions of cats and dogs were euthanized across the country but lets pat ourselves on the back for this one single story
UpliftingNews,removed,oh so he paid for their weddings to other men i read that as he just bought women to be his wives

UpliftingNews,removed,basketball plus raised by his grandmother i was expecting a black kid
UpliftingNews,removed,i mean its cool that he made the shot but i dont think that has any bearing on his character or reflects in any way on how good of a person he is would he be less good of a guy if he missed the shot unless you mean the girl giving the money to her grandmother is a good person and then id agree but your comment implies you mean the director of basketball operations and not her
UpliftingNews,removed,kuck fu
UpliftingNews,removed,kuck fu
UpliftingNews,removed,wat a retard
UpliftingNews,removed,the shooter never had the opportunity to have the money the student gets to pick nonbasketball player they want to shoot for them the student picked the director of basketball operations the same guy she saw make it last year
UpliftingNews,removed,he didnt give away though i see what op is trying to say he just made a basketball shot but the guy didnt have to shoo the ball though the person that has a chance to win the money gets to pick any person in the arena to shot for them so they naturally picked the guy that managed to do it the year before
UpliftingNews,removed,you people love to use the word offended as if people only hate douchebags because their feelings are fragile if one of your hangouts is taken over by rude idiots its fucking annoying if this sub were taken over by youtube commenters or call of duty fans offended would not be the word to use i dont want you to stop being a dick i want you to get the fuck out

UpliftingNews,removed,cool are they going to get third world and communist countries to stop unchecked polluting no because marxism cares about people like pedophilia cares about children
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont understand this whole climate change movement the ncpa found that humans only contribute a mere percent of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere we shouldnt be worrying about us we should be worrying about and bear with me cows a good article was released on reddit a few months ago showing a study that found by incorporating a seaweed supplement into cow diets it can cut their methane emissions by percent cows contribute about percent of all greenhouse gases emissions
UpliftingNews,removed,cuck
UpliftingNews,removed,i kinda wish there would be a major war where there would be a draft so then all of you weak back everyone gets a trophy titbags would either get killed off arrested for avoiding a draft or go to war and learn to be a man without being so damn sensitive
UpliftingNews,removed,seriously ill forgive your ignorance and let you know many families cant afford a plane ticket back home in nigeria my parents have been planning to come for my convocation in june but they pulled out cos they cant just afford to come at the moment cos of the economic crisis nigeria is presently going through the exchange rates have more than doubled in the last months

UpliftingNews,removed,she on the phone like louie louie gucci gucci fendi fendi pradanow you have that song in your head
UpliftingNews,removed,wow thats more than thousand dollars per kid mathishard
UpliftingNews,removed,after a bit of research looks like sensationalist title is not true other pages merely talk about very vaguely the numbers of people that she may have had anything whatsoever to do with in any way at all the httpsenwikipediaorgwikimargueritebarankitse says children had benefited from her help either directly or indirectly the page describes it as come to the aid of httpwwwafricacomangelofafrica says young lives have been changed for the better says young people were assisted im not saying that she is doing bad work or that the whole thing is a scam but i am also percent certain that like all charities they make sure they count every single person they ever come into contact with as a saved story even if they just handed a bottle of water to them one day
UpliftingNews,removed,did someone catch her already i could really use right now
UpliftingNews,removed,and then the fucking trannies are goona use this to fucking try to shag all of our girlfriend with their fake fucking dicks because theyre lesbians but they know lesbians fucking suck and nobody likes them so they get a fake dick put inbetween their legs so they can trick strait women into shagging with them

UpliftingNews,removed,theres an incredibly old indian guy sitting at the table in his village with his head in his hands surrounded by the heads and pelts of the tigers he hunted himself to free his people from servitude why he cries at the cruel sky why do white people like things that kill us
UpliftingNews,removed,this isnt uplifting this is terrifying ahhh

UpliftingNews,removed,fuck tigers
UpliftingNews,removed,population went up when they ate that chinese woman
UpliftingNews,removed,brace for antiindia shit posts

UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,not so good for that chinese woman over at rwatchpeopledie
UpliftingNews,removed,not to be a downer but i dont think this is very good news for the mowglis of those environments
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting news for tigers not so uplifting news for other local animals that serve as their food

UpliftingNews,removed,until trumps son decides to kill again
UpliftingNews,removed,great also peasants eaten by tigers in india next year up by per cent of course they should not go extinct but never forget they kill a lot of people

UpliftingNews,removed,this is not uplifting news a convicted traitor gets unnecessary cosmetic surgery for free while thousands of other honorable veterans suffer if i go to prison for rape and murder and i feel like i should have been born with a straighter nose will you be applauding the use of taxpayer funds to give me a nice straight nose
UpliftingNews,removed,this guy is a total asshole all the responses he gave in that video revolved around money rather than the actual purpose of the product to save a life yeah hes smart but my god is he a such a slimy cunt
UpliftingNews,removed,my conclusion from browsing rworldnews is that the vast majority of americans have no fucking idea what socialism means they use it as if its an insult
UpliftingNews,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot

UpliftingNews,removed,hes just hibernating
UpliftingNews,removed,not to be a downer but they dont really look like they made it
UpliftingNews,removed,if i live to be my life will be a complete failure
UpliftingNews,removed,message me ill tell you who he is
UpliftingNews,removed,like many cute animal saviour stories on rupliftingnews i say this is click bait where is the footage as proof i wish this were true
UpliftingNews,removed,what if they were female twins
UpliftingNews,removed,happy birthday bernie sanders
UpliftingNews,removed,triggered
UpliftingNews,removed,i believe all these shootings are a way of forming gun control the government does not care who dies i bet they are the people who did this
UpliftingNews,removed,tasty
UpliftingNews,removed,all strollers matter
UpliftingNews,removed,if you believe in this sort of thing you might say that the cat senses the bear is getting older and closer to death like cats at nursing homes but thats probably bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,what kind of loser abandons their own baby my uncle said when he was in vietnam they would raid a village and it wasnt uncommon for the parents to drop their babies on the ground and run he said one time they were actually tossing their own infants over a cliff because the babies were slowing them down wow i guess at the end of the day we are better off with this natural selection
UpliftingNews,removed,those people are all white
UpliftingNews,removed,what kind of animal brings a kid to a protest
UpliftingNews,removed,right so many adult lives at risk for one stinkin baby
UpliftingNews,removed,shoulda said look for a novel quote
UpliftingNews,removed,so thats where all the white people at the protest went to
UpliftingNews,removed,nah i can finally have my dog tags and purple heart safely put away wait i was sure my purple heart was right here
UpliftingNews,removed,not sure if youre referring to the story or your username
UpliftingNews,removed,thanks for the flashbacks
UpliftingNews,removed,fun fact the americans killed entire villages and raped women of people on upon entering
UpliftingNews,removed,where does it mention he was storming a beach for all we know he might have lost his tags on leave after the tart he was screwing on the beach for a bar of chocolate complained they were hitting her in the face
UpliftingNews,removed,i said fatass how old are you
UpliftingNews,removed,english do you read it
UpliftingNews,removed,i assumed it was the dogs remains i was modestly disappointed dogs werent involved
UpliftingNews,removed,poor guy i dont see how this is uplifting at all
UpliftingNews,removed,fake and gay s
UpliftingNews,removed,back then it was the draft in modern days theyre mostly rednecks with no better option let the downvotes rain on me ps im not generalizing i have much respect for men and women who put their life on the line but as a former marine and someone who has multiple highschool buddies that also joined the marines all at different times its a general consensus that most marines are simply wannabe badasses who used the military as an easy career choice
UpliftingNews,removed,he was coerced into murdering people that were coerced into murdering his friends the bankers who coordinated the whole thing literally call them their dogs and even give them dog tags the whole thing is sad beyond comprehension
UpliftingNews,removed,im still a little confused why we should give money to parents who drop their kid off at mcdonalds to have a sleepover with a kid they dont know well i definitely feel sympathy for what he went through and no one should have to go through that but hes not in the hospital so probably doesnt have extensive medical bills we are just giving money to parents who are apparently idiots maybe they can use it to buy a happy meal next time they drop him off
UpliftingNews,removed,that is not very uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,its not really extenuating circumstances his wife didnt have an accident he signed up for a job knowing he had to be on call and that he would have to ditch it when his wife went into labor its not like we dont know how long pregnancy is he was being irresponsible im sure if he had been upfront about his wifes situation they would have either worked around or never hired him
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe he shouldnt be knocking up women without a stable job i am sure he will disappear into the wind soon anyway
UpliftingNews,removed,my dad was at arbys because he was stressing everyone out
UpliftingNews,removed,you do not apply for a job you know you cannot do
UpliftingNews,removed,applying for a job knowing you cant fulfill its requirements is
UpliftingNews,removed,i do however know that you can generally narrow it down within a day period
UpliftingNews,removed,sure all that is true so he applied for a job with requirements he knew he could not meet i dont know why anyone is surprised hes fired
UpliftingNews,removed,america is such a shit country only money matters in their eyes fuck america
UpliftingNews,removed,story is fishy media uses any feeble excuse to showcase a mixedrace couple
UpliftingNews,removed,he has three other children according to a different nh news story how do you think hes going to pay child support for the other three kids fuck you hes an irresponsible asshole spreading his deficient dna creating a whole new generation of equally worthless humans that the rest of us will have to support also
UpliftingNews,removed,dumbass
UpliftingNews,removed,do i enjoy getting up and going to work everyday to pay for rent insurance bills and the student loans that i havent defaulted on not really i sure wish i was as footloose and fancy free to fuck off a parttime job to see my fourth kid born even though his mother doesnt work and all we have is welfare and people stupid enough to gofund my poor life choices
UpliftingNews,removed,the article says he was offered an apprenticeship with the ibew international brotherhood of electrical workers did you just pull master electrical engineer out of your ass
UpliftingNews,removed,a black dude who wants to be there for his kid we should be giving him a medal
UpliftingNews,removed,just imagine how many cucks attend the birth cut the cord blah blah and listen to all the screaming and bawling and then get divorced by their wife anyway chucked out the house lose the kids and get rinsed in court must suck
UpliftingNews,removed,is not in the practice of releasing employees stated in the article you published but must be cognizant of the product we give our clients i tried three times i cant even guess what they think they were trying to say im going to have to go with something stupid
UpliftingNews,removed,a black guy with a job and sticking around for his kidsfake news
UpliftingNews,removed,when a guy is living in a shitty rented apartment handing over the majority of his wages to his ex wife who now lives in their former matrimonial home where she is fucking her new boyfriend and he thinks back to how he attended the birth whispered encouraging words and cut the cord and jumped through all the right hoops he probably feels like a bit of a cunt is all im saying and as of marriages end up pretty much like this there must be millions of men who know exactly what i am talking about even if you say you dont as for giving your friends a hard time because they buck the weight of expectation placed upon them by society why dont you mind your own business
UpliftingNews,removed,yo im sorry but what did you expect its a day trial period you cant do anything special like a normal full time employee who has already proven themselves durig that time frame why should their be exceptions oh because your wife is pregnant look dogs and cats cant push it in and pull it out theres nothing special about getting pregnant you chose to have a kid that was your choice your employer had the right to terminate you during that time period its their right sorry but you dont deserve a go fund me page because you honestly disobeyed the rules of your job you were on a probationary period and as such no special treatments ought to be afforded you you chose to have a kid if you were not financially able to have one then wtf is wrong with you if you dont have a real job then why the fuck are you putting your dick in her with no protection why is she not on birth control having a baby is not a special thing dogs and cats do it youre a human you know better and yet your dumb ass decided to have a kid without a stable employment you deserve nothing get over yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,this is a good idea
UpliftingNews,removed,shouldve just tweeted a meme it worked for wendys
UpliftingNews,removed,no sorry all my money gets lavished on me alone not surprised you sound like the mass shooter elliot rodger yo
UpliftingNews,removed,if it is just a matter of love for the child why has anyone here got an opinion it is none of their business
UpliftingNews,removed,no i suggest he doesnt agree to work terms he knows he cannot fulfill its not like he doesnt know when his kid is due if you seperate emotion from the equation its no different from him taking a job knowing he knows he cannot possibly do if i interviewed and accepted a job that required me to do x you would rightfully fire me when i later admit i cant do x
UpliftingNews,removed,what a faggot
UpliftingNews,removed,its just because his wife has some big ass titties
UpliftingNews,removed,mudsharks baby daddy that looks like a total puts gets fired media goes apeshit gets a job that he will soon be fired from again happiness
UpliftingNews,removed,she fucked a sand nigger lol
UpliftingNews,removed,you usually dont lose a job for missing one single day something tells me he would have done anything to get out of work also im so fucking sick of seeing bmwf on reddits front page every single day chill with the race mixing
UpliftingNews,removed,bullshit you have to be human to have compassion
UpliftingNews,removed,miscegenation is akin to bestiality
UpliftingNews,removed,test
UpliftingNews,removed,to be fair the ceo likely had no idea about this
UpliftingNews,removed,well if we really wanted to sharpen up the pitchforks we could find which companies do hire them then boycott ghetto companies until they fire salerno but that would put a little of people out of work so maybe not
UpliftingNews,removed,you pour the concrete and everything will be fine
UpliftingNews,removed,there are power tripping shit managers everywhere dude
UpliftingNews,removed,a black father must be fake
UpliftingNews,removed,attending the birth of child is just irrational i dont understand why anyone would want to do that
UpliftingNews,removed,hrjrj
UpliftingNews,removed,jfjdjd
UpliftingNews,removed,ujett
UpliftingNews,removed,fucking nigger loving cunt they should both be brought out back and shot what the fuck is the world coming to
UpliftingNews,removed,i would have fired the nigger for knocking up a white woman
UpliftingNews,removed,he already has kids new must be to attract front page karma
UpliftingNews,removed,calling bullshit on some black dude that doesnt have a job knocking up women times and then screams about getting fired makes me a tough guy i think youre just a pussy
UpliftingNews,removed,a black guy that wants to be involved in his childrens life you cant blame the employer of being suspicious
UpliftingNews,removed,ah so thats the endgame of the ridiculous whining about how white people have it so hard youve been doing on uupliftingnews youve been waiting for a chance to use the subs popularity to scam donations out of people
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting news man loses thumb and job maybe gets new job
UpliftingNews,removed,man even restaurant gms dont necessarily know when or why the front of house manager fires people
UpliftingNews,removed,crows are the shit theres one by my house thats a total bro he brings me shiny objects in exchange for snacks
UpliftingNews,removed,quebec sucks theres a reason it used to be called lower canada for the longest time
UpliftingNews,removed,his most memorable speech in the movie starts with heres the thing
UpliftingNews,removed,ok so you need two sets of crows you find two large murders you feed one and be super bro to over time you feed them closer to the other murder while pissing off another group of crows to the point theyll actively attack you when within of eachother sight of eachother let the bad crows attack you while the bro crows have possible reactions defend you do nothing or attack you if they defend you it would be quite interesting to figure out how complex the friendship and the alliance is
UpliftingNews,removed,ok we keep crows as bros but we swap in seagulls as the ones to piss off i hate seaguls i have heard stories of individual seagulls attacking specific people if you can piss off enough seagulls and there is luckily enough a group of crows around hows the odds for avion warfare looking now
UpliftingNews,removed,cant let the crows lose i picked this war i dragged my allies into it i am not going to sit idly and allow them to lose ill be packing a tennis racket and whatever i can find as a range weapon i can find that suitable for avian warfare may bring some more human power to the fight i really hate seagulls the idea of taking the skys from is glorious
UpliftingNews,removed,i just lost a job at a local grocery store it was one of the easiest but most awful jobs ive had in a while made great friends though wasnt expecting that im actually in the process of going to court against them grocery stores used to be a great job and especially a career it doesnt seem to be that way anymore however i dont really know how it goes with places like whole foods or trader joes during my current job search ive been trying to find some online work anywhere possible so that i can pay off something i found that utest is neat because you can start with no experience and they have courses for free to take and then get certified in for more opportunities on their site onespace is also turning out to be nifty based on your background i dont have much they will open up qualifications which you take tests to pass once you pass you are certified and more qualifications will open up for you to take tests in to become certified as well im still working on all of it i also just got hired by babblytype which is transcribing i havent gotten my hands dirty yet but i did just finish typing out my form for them try this site while waiting for responses to jobs youve applied for it will give you online opportunities in the meantime good luck i know its hard not to be discouraged and depressed i know i havent been anything but depressed lately httpwwwdreamhomebasedworkcom
UpliftingNews,removed,its easier to convert someone to your cult if they are already susceptible to cults
UpliftingNews,removed,haha word turn up
UpliftingNews,removed,great news i am sure many on here will be against it because he was a straight white male but he really is a national treasure who reapected everyone
UpliftingNews,removed,its an awesome city i lived there for years
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,yes
UpliftingNews,removed,roger roger were landing all clear at rogers roger roger that
UpliftingNews,removed,talk about your self more to confuse everybody
UpliftingNews,removed,king fuckerberg what an ahole
UpliftingNews,removed,facebook more like gaybook haha i should post that on rjokes prob top ten all time
UpliftingNews,removed,this is not uplifting news this is heavily depressing humanitarian abdullah alqahtani was outraged with the post and decided to locate the street cleaner and buy him jewelry thats going full retard puts me in mind of the time that obese bus monitor was verbally bullied for ten minutes by a couple of middleschoolers when the video went viral reddit raised over dollars for her it was the stupidest thing imaginable this is like that if this rubbish gives you lot faith in humanity youre the reason i hate humanity
UpliftingNews,removed,yes i realise all that and someone standing up and saying this is wrong was lovely and then deciding to buy him jewellery was fucking retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,cancer is gods punishment for the amendment
UpliftingNews,removed,oh because thats what im upset about id have been fine if they gave him money you have properly assessed the situation oh and incidentally a woman made me feel bad once i am setting up a donations page as we speak please gib generously you downs riddled little tit
UpliftingNews,removed,i guess thats fair though the subreddit is called uplifting news either way i think we have exhausted this discussion my friend i hope you have a great day
UpliftingNews,removed,women am i right
UpliftingNews,removed,twattttttt
UpliftingNews,removed,this is part of why people were criticizing the laws that would keep trans people out of specific bathrooms on the grounds that they would assault women statistically speaking women already share a bathroom with the person that is most likely to abuse them this trend probably goes for bothany genders because humans abuse who they know in higher numbers than those that they do not know domestic abuse against any gender is a huge problem and im happy that this woman will hopefully receive the help she needs but my heart still breaks for all of the people that are still sharing a home with their abuser
UpliftingNews,removed,butt rape
UpliftingNews,removed,reminds me of a comedians routine talking about how only men have crazy exs because if a woman has a crazy partner most likely hell kill her whenif the relationship ends
UpliftingNews,removed,youre pretty fucking dumb
UpliftingNews,removed,exactly so them trying to connect women at home being abused by someone they know to what cis women being assaulted by people they dont know who are pretending to be trans in a public bathroom why bring it up if its so unrelated to the points and principles
UpliftingNews,removed,exactly so i fail to see what strangers pretending to be trans women in public restrooms has to do with this or why it was brought up
UpliftingNews,removed,dont these vandals know that muslims absolutely hate money they should vandalize these businesses with a plethora of bills they especially hate it when that money is showered on charities
UpliftingNews,removed,so youd like to abolish trial by jury and innocent until proven guilty as well as no cruel and unusual punishment head right over to isil they will love you
UpliftingNews,removed,one of those things is not like the other
UpliftingNews,removed,whens the wedding uilickanalblood ubloodgushingcock
UpliftingNews,removed,go fuck yourself libtard
UpliftingNews,removed,youre a feminazi arent you you
UpliftingNews,removed,go judge someone else helicopter troll
UpliftingNews,removed,so you are a neck beard or fat chick stalker with no life got it dont you get that the reddit history search is what we want you to do you are snagged hook line and sinker with your nosey neighbor inclinations like a raccoon or nigger breaking into someones home
UpliftingNews,removed,ie women are more likely to use attempted suicide as a form of manipulation
UpliftingNews,removed,i suspect the husband is probably a nice guy probably the wife is a bitch and is just crazy and refuses sex is a pain around the house and is just unfaithful these news articles never tell the whole story of the womans bad behaviour as a woman i know these things
UpliftingNews,removed,california right that came to light after brock turner
UpliftingNews,removed,thats exactly what i intended you to do google it
UpliftingNews,removed,aw r u gonna b ok bud
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre specifying he didnt forcefully stick his penis in her vagina he went next door instead
UpliftingNews,removed,his suggestion was obviously facetious your sarcastic reply was met with more sarcasm surprise yeah fucking google it if youre too lazy or stupid to read up on it too bad its not my job to provide sparknotes for you
UpliftingNews,removed,take your own advice also fuck off
UpliftingNews,removed,whats even more hilarious is that they would have said the exact opposite if he was hurt and tried their hardest to make it so he wouldnt touch a dime for his hospital stay
UpliftingNews,removed,if she didnt make my sandwhich she probably deserved it
UpliftingNews,removed,its apparent youre asking people to pity you or else you wouldnt be so transparent in that comment get over yourself attention whore
UpliftingNews,removed,sweet if i was a robot i could compete marathons too
UpliftingNews,removed,half marathon for a half person i guess at least it will have a painless childbirth
UpliftingNews,removed,guilty conscience
UpliftingNews,removed,holy fuck not only the executioner but he killed three other isis scumbags with that same bullet incredible skill incredible efficiency
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry but im calling bullshit no reliable source and we hear lots of these sas stories floating about all over the place i bet most of them are made up apart from anything a non incendiary bullet wouldnt ignite a flamethrower back pack
UpliftingNews,removed,the source article is completely different from this one and has no mention of flame throwers or torture they both read like plots of an action b movie neither of them use any names they are both tabloid newspapers
UpliftingNews,removed,i tried sharing this exact article on facebook earlier and was informed by fb that it contains content that is selectively being blocked by facebook so i guess this uplifting fascinating story cant be shared there
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder what cocaine is like for this loveable pooch
UpliftingNews,removed,guys guys he turned into bacon no virgins for him hes unclean meat
UpliftingNews,removed,i give him a week
UpliftingNews,removed,dont let that dog near hillary clinton
UpliftingNews,removed,well shes clearly not a jew
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,couldnt reply to you in rpolitics because well quoting trump got me in trouble apparently so i tracked you down here just wanted to say thanks for the big map of the states to show me where all the white people live in your nation i found it interesting i guess its good to know how to dodge the racists in the states for travel so the map helps
UpliftingNews,removed,steady on
UpliftingNews,removed,once of year volunteers are the worst lets just feed them for one day in the meantime get wasted haze the new class and wait days until we do it again
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder if this is the equivalent of green washing by corporations
UpliftingNews,removed,holy hell i misread the title and thought it said peadophillia fraternity cooks thanksgiving dinner for citys homeless i was like what the shit i guess thats upliftingsorta
UpliftingNews,removed,no but thats still the implied meaning of the word to many people saying population implies the entirety of the homeless that inhabit philly i dont like linking a dictionary definition to try to prove things but thats what it says for the first few definitions httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarypopulation
UpliftingNews,removed,fraternities perpetuate rape culture they are disgusting male only spaces that do nothing but promote white privilege
UpliftingNews,removed,i first read title as pedophile fraternity and was very very confused
UpliftingNews,removed,it would be a whole lot better if they did more than just cook them a single meal during the year
UpliftingNews,removed,anyone else mistakenly read paedophile fraternity as they scrolled through the feed
UpliftingNews,removed,lol that and the rape parties
UpliftingNews,removed,so what did you guys do stand around holding signs
UpliftingNews,removed,pc standa for pussy crushing
UpliftingNews,removed,and by thanksgiving dinner they mean keg stands for everyone hey bro there is a sandwich in every meal
UpliftingNews,removed,theres a stigma because of the shit you guys pull dont act like its not warranted
UpliftingNews,removed,its funny when organizations have mandatory charity events to act like these people are ducking saints when theyre told they have to show up
UpliftingNews,removed,oh boy they force you to collect grand once a year and you think that absolves you guys of any guilt for being d bags huh
UpliftingNews,removed,this was literally one of the reason i dropped out of college move to a different state from ca to go to school was overwhelmed by bros living on daddys credit card trying to aggressively regulate who was hitting the blunt frat pat bro did you throw down on this me nah man but those other three blunts you just hit were mine
UpliftingNews,removed,my abusive alcoholic dad once said good job too
UpliftingNews,removed,its good to know thats what qualifies as getting super into it lol yes there are community service requirements that are annoying but its not like everyone loves spending their saturdays planting trees ahh theres those true colors
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah because you were made to loooooooool stop acting like fucking mother theresa when you joined a frat to get girls drunk at a frat house buh bye
UpliftingNews,removed,or the hazing ceremony in the shitty basement with christmas lights
UpliftingNews,removed,i have no problem with the charity work but there is no need for this absurd circlejerk about how frat bros are literally saints dont forget that pc stands for pussy crushing
UpliftingNews,removed,this is a joke right nobody was talking about only his frat we were talking about fraternities do you honestly think he was saying that his specific frat has a stigma that the rest dont how fucking stupid are you
UpliftingNews,removed,lol whoosh guess i shouldnt have bothered youre intentionally being obtuse because you dont like what i said its cool
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah im dick for not bending over backwards to suck their dicks because someone else made them go be charitable yeah hilarious
UpliftingNews,removed,theres a comment id expect from a fraternity member
UpliftingNews,removed,theres a stigma that black people are criminals because some of them are actually theres a stigma that black people are criminals due to the absurd justice system and open racism that this country has harbored for decades terrible example
UpliftingNews,removed,more than the one day a year these guys make some food or do some skits for drunk drivinglol fucking seriously and do you want to know the best part no one is forcing me to fucking do it
UpliftingNews,removed,do i really ahve to spell it out for you then that wasnt intentional and youre just stupid im sorry man i didnt realize you might actually be that dumb good luck with life youll need it
UpliftingNews,removed,riiiiiight its just those bad chapters those other guys never me or my crew
UpliftingNews,removed,he specifically said community service requirements are annoying i dont care if he doesnt have a smile on his face while planting trees but if youre gonna call that shit annoying then im not gonna circlejerk with you about what a saint you are for being forced to do something some people go out and do it without being forced to whether they like it or not imagine fucking that
UpliftingNews,removed,many fraternity chapters do a great deal of good for their communities the reverse is also true many fraternity chapters do a great deal of harm to their communities as well
UpliftingNews,removed,lol i dont have to buy my friends but thats a good one
UpliftingNews,removed,most are upstanding people who will go on to have go on to do great things ahh yes nepotism at work the true american way huh
UpliftingNews,removed,you couldnt pay me to pledge a frat lol i dont buy my friends dumbass
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah im sure guy you were in a frat full of absolute saints that never did anything wrong lol what a joke
UpliftingNews,removed,lol you think i care if you morons agree with me sad
UpliftingNews,removed,i think our record was hours or so how much do you give back is that supposed to be a joke you think hours is a lot
UpliftingNews,removed,making a year and no student loan come at me bro
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah you guys as in frats its why you have the stigma are you fucking retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah i didnt see anybody really learning just regurgitating and living off mom and dads money didnt need a piece of paper anyway make more than most of them now
UpliftingNews,removed,ahhh yes also they collectively do more in a day than you will in your life thats the attitude i expect from you fratty
UpliftingNews,removed,do cities have a pedo church thats known for molesting people because colleges sure as shit have rape frats whether you guys realize it or not the rest of the campus lets everyone know who to avoid like the plague
UpliftingNews,removed,youre a moron i would have to want to join one first
UpliftingNews,removed,for sure which is why no colleges have a rape frat right that isnt a common thing on college campuses right try again
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont have to count my hours on a sign in sheet because its not required but its sure as hell more than hours
UpliftingNews,removed,sure i was more or less disappointed that college was really just an expansion of high school where spoiled bros and hoes rose to the top i mean most folks that have a bs in communication think they have a bs in communicaitons they showed up drank ran mom and dads cc and now wonder why they are sales development reps making a year or better yet you have a piece of paper and a shit ton of student loans and bitch and moan on rpersonalfinance about how your life sucks and how the fuck you over cry me a river i just realized college was a scam and the turds that i went to school with just helped me realize before i spent too much money and wasted too much time
UpliftingNews,removed,then go jerk each other off all you want im out this is just sad
UpliftingNews,removed,i prefer not to name the organisation i volunteer with as that steps into asking for personal info and you trying to find out where i live
UpliftingNews,removed,yea theres a stereotype sometimes its pretty true there you go then thats why there is a stigma its not rocket science that guy acting like frats are misunderstood saints is just sad atleast be self aware enough to realize why that stigma exists
UpliftingNews,removed,its a no clearly but that was cute of you to try and twist my words around like an asshole i didnt pledge any frats or attempt to get any bids still not even sure what that means because frats are stupid i dont need to pay for some friends to hang out with i just made friends instead
UpliftingNews,removed,what
UpliftingNews,removed,youre right it isnt less valuable but i dont have to circlejerk with these idiots because someone made them go be charitable
UpliftingNews,removed,that truly means jack shit asshole go away now
UpliftingNews,removed,i know a lot of people in fraternities who do it because they dont know anybody at their new school fuck them for trying to be social and have friends am i right lol being social and buying friends are two different things do you think most people go to college knowing everyone already cmon dude everyone is at a new school we didnt all run to the nearest place we could buy some friends like pussies
UpliftingNews,removed,sucks college is a douchey crowd but thats the american way i guess us imports a majority of it software engineers its not a mystery why let me guess youre a college graduate worried about american jobs but you dont have a clue what an is thats what i figured go buy another piece of hardwaresoftware and pay my paycheck thanks
UpliftingNews,removed,if you only knew d
UpliftingNews,removed,oh how could i forget you guys are the victims here how dare those evil exs slander you yeah fuck all those girls who are busy making up rape accusations none of them are true please tell me youre not that delusional guy
UpliftingNews,removed,just because there is some good doesnt mean you have to willfully ignore the evil god damn you realize how frustrating it is from my perspective when youre using the same fucking argument and thinking it makes your point more than mine
UpliftingNews,removed,well ive never had someone who wasnt in a fraternity tell me to chug bleach so theres that lol i like how he deleted it though shows some real backbone that one
UpliftingNews,removed,just because you can see some evil doesnt mean you have to willfully ignore the good just because you see some good doesnt mean you should willfully ignore evil
UpliftingNews,removed,god forbid anyone play devils advocate right
UpliftingNews,removed,cool its a mentorship program
UpliftingNews,removed,i know that statistically they werent a group of saints
UpliftingNews,removed,thats what i thought and happy holidays to you as well
UpliftingNews,removed,i can admit fraternities have a systemic problem with sexual assault to tackle can you admit that fraternities are not all identical and that they are capable of doing good absolutely do you think i dont actually know anyone in fraternities or sororities i do i know people in all types from architecture frats to party frats to stoney frats i just dont think mandatory volunteer work really needs to be paraded around like its something special its not least of all on thanksgiving when everyone and their mom is volunteering at soup kitchens and making meals for the homeless all across the country do you know what would impress me a little if they did this on a day that everyone else wasnt doing it already im sure the homeless could probably use a meal the other days a year as well
UpliftingNews,removed,sure
UpliftingNews,removed,where did i say i was at their house brosif
UpliftingNews,removed,mo money mo problem sucks
UpliftingNews,removed,so glad you looked that term up and educated yourself you should stop writing incomplete sentences and show us that you received more than a piece of paper
UpliftingNews,removed,not knowing that your country imports a majority of its sciencemath based professions is kinda critical for someone who thinks they are part of a democracy
UpliftingNews,removed,this sad joke is so tired someone would have to want to be in your stupid club to get cut idiots
UpliftingNews,removed,i have not tried to deny the existence of a dark side to greek life or minimize the experience of the victims of sexual assault no thats just everyone else in this thread the stigma against fraternities affects members every day seriously more playing the victim its thanksgiving cant we just be thankful that these guys took time out of their vacations to make sure the homeless in philadelphia got a hot meal today without assigning character judgments and no its the most popular volunteer day of the year try volunteering when its not trendy and well talk
UpliftingNews,removed,frats arent really hated because theyre drunk and rowdy people hate them because theyre racists and rapists
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah man i dont get why people get so upset over a little bit of rape
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah because college friends pay my bills
UpliftingNews,removed,im good dragon slayer i make more than most of you turds with a piece of paper anyway go waste more time playing video games turd
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe you can write a complete sentence if you can write a complete sentence then perhaps we can get you a decent paying job
UpliftingNews,removed,this website was built by a team with at least one person on a visa fact the phone you are on was built with a team of people who have someone on a visa fact the web browser you are on was built with a team of people who have someone on a visa fact the wifi router you are getting internet was designed and built with a team of people who have someone on a visa yeah failing american eduction is unimportant to a democracy youre right
UpliftingNews,removed,lol yes and you are an unbiased le stemly stem ubermensch yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah the war on white males in technology is really impressive nice work frat boys
UpliftingNews,removed,go do more acid and go to house parties turd
UpliftingNews,removed,no chance
UpliftingNews,removed,lol youre twisting my words around asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,it doesnt make up for all the young college girls theyve drugged and raped
UpliftingNews,removed,keep renting
UpliftingNews,removed,lol again cute assumption but you couldnt be more wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,all this charity is probably gonna get us mad pussy brah bitches love dudes that do gay charity shit all frat guys everywhere
UpliftingNews,removed,but hes a fucking white male
UpliftingNews,removed,then theyll all get shitfaced on saturday and rape a few college sluts
UpliftingNews,removed,they dont need any help
UpliftingNews,removed,im not jesus they call me julio
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont need approval from a housekeeper
UpliftingNews,removed,at my school a frat got suspended for waving dildos at antirape protesters another frat was suspended for hazing that landed freshman in the er with acute alcohol poisoning and another was suspended because they had multiple gangrape allegations against them all of my friends at other schools say pretty much the same stuff about the frats at their school not as bad though i have zero respect for frats and dont think the single philanthropy event that each one does each semester outweighs the bad that comes with greek life
UpliftingNews,removed,a little background there is also these articles which have more info i am a friend of the family whos daughter is fundraising for this cause in the title neighborhood where she teaches many people think that most grow up with all the same toys but shes noticed a huge difference and even though when people of providing they typically think of necessities not a simple pleasure which can change a persons world in which they have access to explore and see beyond their horizons i think this is great and after being featured on steve harvey and national news broadcasts she has received an outpour of support form the community yet she is almost to her goal and not only does this buy bikes but helmets locks and names engraved in them we got this share this post currently goal
UpliftingNews,removed,you must be fun at parties
UpliftingNews,removed,brutal work and toil and sacrifice that goes into making such enjoyable polished finished products and creature comforts possible in the first place work that was mainly done by white men and women in the us not india which is why theres a desi diaspora and indians occupy top spots in our society white people in the west created equal rights and a civil society then extended it to minorities and even other nations we also fought a series of wars to uphold those rights india didnt do that india was modernized by the british empire then they gained independence and have barely struggled above poverty level but hey its important you rename bombay to mumbai because indians have to have something i mean creating zero social progress on the planet youre going to have an inferiority complex which is what you can observe in many nations including india but the us is always bad right aziz ansari hes going home to his champagne bath and foot massage tonight right lol your viewpoint is a joke
UpliftingNews,removed,stupid whore
UpliftingNews,removed,they will just revert to insurgency tactics they still control land in niger and other african nations too
UpliftingNews,removed,i really hope the people volunteering know how to not fuck up a steak while cooking ive seen some delicious meals ruined by people who meant well but just dont know what they are doing with nicer cuts of meat
UpliftingNews,removed,i say slaughter and rape them like they did to all of those helpless people
UpliftingNews,removed,do you have a source for this
UpliftingNews,removed,not to poop on your parade but she is still going to die just like the rest of us
UpliftingNews,removed,dickoh wait sorry up vote u mean hello
UpliftingNews,removed,or hang these bastards boko haram did these things because of their twisted ideology no amount of mercy and kindness will change this ideology
UpliftingNews,removed,i had some sjw cunt comment on my facebook when i shared the news of his death she said people die when i replied how edgy she went on to moan about how people care too much about the rick and famous people they never met and should instead do more about the children who get a rifle butt in the mouth i would post the news of his philanthropism but i doubt it would make any difference i never met the guy just thought he was a dude who sang great reading this earns him some kudos from me for what little its worth
UpliftingNews,removed,unfortunately they did
UpliftingNews,removed,it was a great trump won and nationalism is on the rise in europe more than offsets the terrorism and usual gender politics agenda pushing
UpliftingNews,removed,cuz as fucked up as it was it was kinda funny
UpliftingNews,removed,replace op with umrsjarpx in your username and it still applies
UpliftingNews,removed,was this a fetus or was he sick for a long time ive never heard of someone capturing a heart beat before their child passed also how did you delete it
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe her son should learn to be more punctual
UpliftingNews,removed,no one cares dude its a question
UpliftingNews,removed,who gives a shit really
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah thats why i asked if it was a fetus that would be the only scenario that made sense that also means she didnt actually know the kid so who gives a shit
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont think you can turn it off i think you only reset it i dont think i can grasp mourning for something i never met i wonder if it is a hormone thing or if your husband also mourns as a husband i would hate to face that situation because i just wouldnt be able to empathize with my wife i sympathize with you though emotions are hard
UpliftingNews,removed,is it got your attention
UpliftingNews,removed,i can tell you with certainty that i would shrug it off and just try again though the labor part certainly sucks
UpliftingNews,removed,sure but its like the difference between losing the bid on that house you wanted and having your house burn down sure it sucks to work so hard to get something you want and not get it but dont act like its the same as losing your childhood home
UpliftingNews,removed,so they didnt bother to intervene when the kid was suicidal too late to care they seem to be some sorta religious freaks from the interview
UpliftingNews,removed,holy shit no fucking duh the point was expectations and experience are not the same and should not be treated the same losing a child you didnt know is not as painful as losing a child you did know
UpliftingNews,removed,oh i am willing to bet money that any person that experienced a still birth and the death of a grown child lets say years old will rank the stillbirth experience as less painful unless that year old was a worthless pos
UpliftingNews,removed,i know you didnt know your child because you told me it was stillborn
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean hilarious

UpliftingNews,removed,thank god for posting this seeing all these people demanding reparations is just depressing its obvious that theyre using the very real struggles of their ancestors as a scapegoat for their own feelings this man knows better good on him
UpliftingNews,removed,unzips the first picture will doz
UpliftingNews,removed,go on
UpliftingNews,removed,girls can be firefighters
UpliftingNews,removed,not going to lie this confederate propaganda disgusts me i dont find this uplifting at all
UpliftingNews,removed,i would not stop cracking jokes if i was the black guy lolol mmmhmm we eatin in tha big house tonight massa
UpliftingNews,removed,so why should it matter dont get me wrong its quite good to see how much america changed but why does it get the news im russian and about years ago we had slavery too it wasnt based on race but its quite possible that i had an ancestor who was a serf peasant and from some other family line i may have ancestor who owned that serf peasant but it doesnt matter right now it was almost years ago why does it matter today
UpliftingNews,removed,what no youre a victim take all his money he stole from your people
UpliftingNews,removed,i hoped they banged thatd be the ultimate win for a former slave
UpliftingNews,removed,the martin luther king jr prophecy is coming true
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder which one is better off financially and could that be traced back through the the roots of slavery either benefiting from or being taken advantaged by would be interesting to see the social mobility of each along with their origins and to see just how much of an impact the sins of the father had either positively or negatively on both families
UpliftingNews,removed,mlk is up in heaven fucking a white woman right now
UpliftingNews,removed,the coonery is a strong in this one
UpliftingNews,removed,shit tell that to the rest of they dont seem to know that
UpliftingNews,removed,what a great story i hope blacks dont call him an uncle tom or other derogatory terms they give to nice polite and educated people of their race
UpliftingNews,removed,who does the house belong to now 😑
UpliftingNews,removed,fucks given
UpliftingNews,removed,on the one hand im happy to see the families meeting and enjoying each others company on the other i find the fact that a former slave plantation has continuously remained in the hands of the family a bit disturbing
UpliftingNews,removed,wow it was very progressive for the white slave owner to have a child with one of his slaves at the time they must have been deeply in love or she was fucking raped but the article wouldnt have glossed over that would it
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont see how this is uplifting news a lot of western democracies now sayits all in the past just leave it in the past but its not those slave owners amassed this wealth and its still being profited off of does robert adams have no issue with inheriting a property where people were treated as less than human does he feel no guilt that the spectre of black people being less than human still continues while he was sitting on his fathers knee in this grand house the descendants of former slaves who built this safe haven were struggling to survive that wealth was built off the blood sweat and dehumanisation of others i would certainly feel bad about enjoying the fruits of it knowing somewhere along the line someone was doomed to a life of misery and squalor and their descendants doomed to a life of being looked down upon
UpliftingNews,removed,dude should definitely cut that other dude in on some of the inheritance money he haswill get
UpliftingNews,removed,lets sit this brother in the corner with stacey dash ben carson and clarence thomas fool hes living in a house built on the blood and bones of your ancestors living the good life while your people got nothing wake up
UpliftingNews,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this uplifting this sounds like uncle tomfoolery not something uplifting maybe its uplifting for whites with a healthy fear of black pride and consciousness¿¿¿¿¿¿
UpliftingNews,removed,how logical he is not holding someones dead relatives actions against him too bad most people cant do this
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont see how anything arising out of slavery is heartwarming this guys great grand dad raped my great grandma aint that awesome wtf
UpliftingNews,removed,aaaaand now this is on the front page so here comes reddit into upliftingnews to use this as an example of why black people are wrong and need to stop complaining
UpliftingNews,removed,its nice to see someone determined not to claim offense or victimhood that being said its undeniable that robert directly benefited from that history and that nkrumah is still impacted by the theft of his descendants labor if your father stole your neighbors life savings before you were born and put it into a college account for you you may not have been at fault but when you find out you do have an ethical responsibility to rectify the situation you essentially bought your life with their money its good to get beyond hatred and work towards peace and tolerance but we shouldnt expect peace without justice no one is obliged to be cool with starting fresh now that the damage is already done to put it another way it would be like if after round of a boxing match one party was found to have used steel knuckles for the first four rounds so he takes them off and says okay now everything is fair lets continue what a good chap you are being so willing to look forward and not backwards
UpliftingNews,removed,itt white people whining as a white person listen to this you have no right to complain basically like ever
UpliftingNews,removed,eww still fucking owns the plantation
UpliftingNews,removed,get on your knees boi and apologies
UpliftingNews,removed,robert doesnt own anybody but he owns or has benefited from significant wealth judging by the colonial house that derives from slavery give up a significant part of your wealth and make a significant contribution to the africanamerican community or the fight against racism or modern slavery and ill be able to rejoice with robert and all the other roberts restitution for unjust dehumanizing treatment of fellow human beings
UpliftingNews,removed,no the white guy should really make reparations i suggest in the form of a table it could be such a symbol gesture a black man who rose up from being descended from slavery to own a table demonstrating to other black people that they too could aspire to table ownership one day
UpliftingNews,removed,i suspect that one of these folks is living better off than the other
UpliftingNews,removed,naw nigga fuck that nigga black lives matter we gotta kill dem whites black lives mattuh
UpliftingNews,removed,did he let him in the big house
UpliftingNews,removed,in before reddit chimes in with see now thatsa how i like black people to behave so nice that these guys dont get racial about racial issues this is the way people should always act because it makes me feel good yes downvote my point is that of course no man should be held responsible for the actions of their ancestors but at the same time sites that operate in favor of the majority such as reddit a simple updown vote site that exists in a realm where many minority groups lack access because of the wake of the very institutional racism and slavery referenced above often react unfairly when someone tries to open a discussion about race but champions bait like this
UpliftingNews,removed,im sorry whos the kid here
UpliftingNews,removed,count the number of selfpitying whities in the comments guh i hated slavery as much as the next guy guys but guh i have this unpopular opinion and just hear me out guys
UpliftingNews,removed,robert alright guys you grab the wood and ill grab the gas we have to make sure this thing is burnin somethin fierce for when nkrumah gets here man is he going to be surprised yes honey right there in the front yard i want him to see it right when he pulls up roberts wife oh honey itll be perfect the smell of burning wood will surely shock the entire family turn a walk into a run robert ok everyone theyre here i hope they like it ive work on this beauty for the past hours nkrumah exits car with a look of horror and disbelief on his face nkmurah excuse me robert but why is such a thing burning and in the front yard do you think this some sick joke are you all mad robert with a disapproving frown you assume wrong nkmurah this is part of our heritage its in our blood and will never leave regardless of how many centuries pass nkmurah im afraid i dont approve of this i think its time my family and i return to a safer area robert dont be ridiculous we lit this beauty up just for your family it hasnt been used since our ancestors first built the plantation besides theres little chance the embers will drift to the house nkmurah i still must protest robert nonsense not sit down and stay put pulls out a knife and with a maniacal smile slowly sharpens it nkmurah but buti robert quit your damn stammerin son now opens the smoker and displays a delicious and savory looking hunk of pork tender and brittle to the touch robert now ive been told this is the best pulled pork in counties you and your family enjoy this and tell me what yall think robert nervously awaits the approval or humiliation to come nkmurah my god robert you are clinically insane why havent you opened up your own shack yet this is the best damn pulled pork ive ever laid my taste buds on
UpliftingNews,removed,thats called moral relativism its the idea that morals are based on culture so we shouldnt judge others based on their morals the aztecs used to cut people open and wear their skin to honor the god of the moon they would sacrifice human beings in order to please the god of the sun this is a great example of why moral relativism is bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,black people were slaves for years get over it already that is nothing compared to most other groups
UpliftingNews,removed,trump is one of them too
UpliftingNews,removed,dae sjw lol

UpliftingNews,removed,can we acknowledge how awkward it gets when youre white dont have a supercommon lastname and meet a black guy with your last name
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet rblacklivesmatter would say otherwise
UpliftingNews,removed,the big problem that blacks have is that in many cases a white slaveowner was probably their grandfather removed so many blacks have an internalconflict born from having masters genes in a sea of black slave genes selfhate anger at the world anger at white people unburdened by racial mixing their internalconflict will only be satisfied once every single one of those blacks with the masters genes is a master again the owner of an updated century version of an antebellum plantation in which each sits around all day telling some undermanager to make their illegals work harder problem is those master genes are from ancestors removed so a little part of them want to reach out and get that plantation while most of them is reaching out for the dubs the welfare check and the
UpliftingNews,removed,great finally some of them get it nobody alive owes them anything
UpliftingNews,removed,looks like a plantation
UpliftingNews,removed,i had a mexican friend who claimed that i owed him reparations i told him that first off i know for a fact that my family has been poor as shit up until very recently and second that i never owned him and i worked my ass off to get to where i am and the reason he doesnt have any money isnt from slavery in his past its the fact that all he does is work as a waiter and when he gets home he drinks or smokes himself to sleep apparently me saying that is white privilege

UpliftingNews,removed,haha the last thread questioned but will this new found money mean he will immediately die because of a lack of purpose people are so dumb and someone in this thread is concerned because all old men in paleta are not also taken care of 🙄 people do something nice but it needs to be psychoanalyzed to see fi it was the perfect form of nice pr if this nice is also a bad which could be not nice or if this nice could have been portioned into many small nices
UpliftingNews,removed,and here i was thinking i had this uniquely clever joke that i was going to post about this headline
UpliftingNews,removed,attorney turned out to be scumbag and syphoned all the monies to himself
UpliftingNews,removed,i wanted to make a joke along the lines of the premise of these interracial gang bang videos are getting really extreme i dont feel like you need such an elaborate plot seems dark but it doesnt really feel like its appropriate oh look my toast is done
UpliftingNews,removed,im pro bonor
UpliftingNews,removed,rimgoingtohellforthis
UpliftingNews,removed,wow really helping people not just raising a fist or sitting on his ass good for him
UpliftingNews,removed,hide ur money and status from trump
UpliftingNews,removed,rsoccer would love you
UpliftingNews,removed,tax write off
UpliftingNews,removed,kind of a dumb move but whatever makes you happy he can provide tons of value as a football player he could probably open up farms instead of just if he kept playing football
UpliftingNews,removed,old news
UpliftingNews,removed,why not play till retirement then make double the amount of farms
UpliftingNews,removed,you can buy a lot of canned goods with
UpliftingNews,removed,this should remind you that there are stupid people he can feed far more people much more efficiently with the money he generates from continuing football rather than quitting it and farming
UpliftingNews,removed,itt fuck poor people hungry people or anybody that wants to help them
UpliftingNews,removed,if his reason for quitting football was to donate to charity this was unbelievably misguided sure he can donate his crop as a farmer but if he donated even a tenth of his income as a football player it would do much more good to the recipient of his donations of course everyone is free to live their life as they please i wouldnt be in the slightest bit surprised if jason brown enjoyed his new lifestyle andor felt a deeper sense of contribution from it and that is fine in fact he should be commended for giving to charity in the first place most people dont do much of that but i dont think it is reasonable to commend him for choosing a more virtuoussounding career over the one when he could have actually done the most good
UpliftingNews,removed,keep planning your financial future based on the past years hopefully rfinancialplanning can help you out when things dont go as expected the undeserved arrogance of students that take a few classes and read a few books is as funny as it is frustrating but people like you will always exist im going to get back to my big boy job now
UpliftingNews,removed,conveniently publicized in a week where an yr old black kid holding a sandwich that somehow looked like a gun to a cop was shot at times and killed a black man eating chicken with a pocket knife in his own backyard was shot to death by two cops a year old foot pound black child was killed by cops who claimed he pulled a realistic looking bb gun on them but an autopsy just revealed he was shot in the side while running away and an unarmed black man standing by his stalled car with his hands up was tased and then shot to death by cops who can be heard on the recording saying that looks like a bad dude this story can gfi
UpliftingNews,removed,this is actually terrible for humanity his agricultural output is not going to be worth very much he made a fortune as a football player humanity would have been much better off if he had continued to work as a football player and then donated his extra income to the food pantry
UpliftingNews,removed,were shitting on him because his choice has resulted in less food available for the pantry imagine if he had worked another year or two and then donated that extra couple million dollars to the food pantry that would be worth more than a lifetime of farming
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah and when he spends all his money on cocaine he will be sucking dick for coke
UpliftingNews,removed,people wont work without capitalism to force them into labor
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure colin kaepernik will follow suit and quit to go into law enforcement or community service
UpliftingNews,removed,title makes it sound like he just decided to quit football one day truth is rams overrpaid for him turned out he was a below average player rams cut him no one wanted to sign himhe was asking for too much and he had to retire
UpliftingNews,removed,that dipshit from the could learn something from this guy
UpliftingNews,removed,yes because hes spending his money to basically become an inefficient gentleman farmer he could have quietly donated it to fund food banks or on for example deworming charities in africa by choosing instead to follow this flashy high profile path he is prioritizing his own image and lifestyle over the welfare of others i think he has the best of intentions but he shouldnt be celebrated
UpliftingNews,removed,exnfl player couldve finished his career at a normal age made more money and then retired with more money to buy a bigger farm and donate more food than the wouldve by doing what he actually did exnfl player is an idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,this is uplifting this makes no economic sense hes leaving a job where he could have made millions so he can work as a farmer which makes only tens of thousands so he can donate that to a food pantry it would have made more sense to play for another couple of years and then donate money so other farmers can produce food for food pantries
UpliftingNews,removed,football fucking pisses me off so much
UpliftingNews,removed,he should be good as long as he hired wutang financial really
UpliftingNews,removed,earning million does not mean he has million cut that amount in half with taxes agent fees and other expenses he probably has million still lots of money if you dont do anything stupid not important hes a good person what seems to give him purpose is helping others not materialism
UpliftingNews,removed,hence the acronym nfl the not for long league
UpliftingNews,removed,helping the world awesome
UpliftingNews,removed,huh and here i was feeling good about myself today cause i let a homeless person lick the wrapper of my wendys burger
UpliftingNews,removed,thats awesome but hed have prolly done better just playing football and using that money to buy farms
UpliftingNews,removed,no even from an economics standpoint you still cant say he isnt utilizing all the good he could do by giving up his football career what if he shortly gets an injury that not only ends his career but also prevents him from being a farmer in the first place then add up all the pounds of food he has donated put a to that amount and then evaluate what could have been lost plus doing good is subjective as donating funds can always be mismanaged by organizations where as wholesome produce usually ends up in the bellies of those who need it also if you want to go into relativity who knows if a starving kid he helped to feed later goes on to invent the warp drive we need to be a multi planetary species try to put a value on that
UpliftingNews,removed,no you are uneducated and should stop posting the study was about adjusting the dollar figure for inflation not the percentage i am not suggesting people follow this old school study peoples life savings are at stake and you are spewing ignorance out of your mouth like your head is a latrine delete your post
UpliftingNews,removed,wow society this man set out to help people in need and all anyone can talkjoke about is his money wtf where is everyones head at
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure its been said already but id just like to state it again for emphasis he could have donated several times more tons of food by ten orders of magnitude to the starving by simply continuing his nfl gig and using the excessive amount of money earned say annually on grassroots poverty organisations or straight donations to the food pantry hes either adhering to a very specific philosophy or he really really wanted to be a farmer from any possible metrics if he just wanted to donate food hes now severely reduced his capacity to do so with no return to make of it
UpliftingNews,removed,exactly he got tired of being a sportsstar or he really wanted to be a farmer if he strictly wanted to maximize happiness of hungry people hed his job and donate a notable sum of his money annually hed still be wealthy and he would have reached out to more people faster and more efficiently third option he got influenced by some benign but less optimal philosophyideology
UpliftingNews,removed,is he growing watermelons
UpliftingNews,removed,is he retarded why not just use his money to set up more farms and hire farmers creating work for the very same people hes feeding and being more efficient in the process
UpliftingNews,removed,i wouldnt mind growing sorghum after i retired at with to invest who does this uplift
UpliftingNews,removed,million can buy a lot of food he made a poor choice for poor people
UpliftingNews,removed,i like the idea
UpliftingNews,removed,coming up in canada explosions
UpliftingNews,removed,wait i thought the brits burned their letters to santa
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah deffinitely also i prefer being nice but fuck gulls theyre bastards
UpliftingNews,removed,just cause a faggot puts on makeup doesnt make this uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,so because a place where most people have french as a first language only use french as a main communication language they are horrible people a place where people give you attitude for not knowing their language is pretty shitty imagine this ill go where you live and start speaking french to everyone expecting them to answer in the same language without making any facial expression that i disapprove of are you that fucking incapable of reading i said nothing of expectations other than expecting people not to be assholes dumbass way to project your insecurities that i disapprove of no making universal signs of aggression like scowling inappropriate behavior like staring so yeah if im going to some shithole and decide whoops this place has shitty people im gonna leave and go where the people are not shitty and you know what if the topic comes up online im not going to lie about it just so some whiny bitch like you can feel better about themselves now go fuck yourself and if you want to insult someone for no reason at least have the balls to be direct instead of being a pussy have a nice day youve made me laugh a lot d
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting news im mexican my wife is mexican our whole family is mexican and we thought it was annoying
UpliftingNews,removed,lol who gives a fuck whats with the modern day pandering ohhh latinos need a voice in hollywood too listen im dominican and colombian i dont care if all the actors were white black or latino their race doesnt matter to me nor does it matter to most latinos i wish they would stop this diverse casting bullshit just because they feel like they need to appeal to every race
UpliftingNews,removed,it was just dumb it is like some distant galaxy long ago and their are like robots with british accents and space mexicans and a guy with extreme space asthma it probably stems from the fact that we both fucking hated the movie anyways
UpliftingNews,removed,of course the little cunts stole the watch and the parents are probably the ones that trained them to do it fuck this propagandawerealwaysrightandnooneeverbreakstherulesinourperfectlyinnocent country bullshit and fuck the knob that tried to get the police to identify the tourists as if they were the wrong doers
UpliftingNews,removed,whoa an instagram link you really got me there lol both the butthurt and racism are so strong in you i really a touched a nerve didnt i hapadouche you hapadouches are hilarious such self pity its amazing you havent killed yourself with all the self pity butthurt and lack of penis you got a year old account and practically no upvotes goes to show how much society sees through your hypocrisy keep the bullshit coming hapadouche its the funniest stuff i get to see on reddit everyday
UpliftingNews,removed,lol you keep coming back with the same rhetoric that makes no sense still a year old account still downvoted left right and centre still butthurt still feel the need to try and prove yourself you are so far off with who you think i am its hilarious white teacher is all you got and its not even close to accurate you share an instagram post and type hahahahaha then criticise me about imaginary internet points really do you not see how stupid that is poor hapadouche doesnt understand english let alone reality how do you sit down with all that butthurt im genuinely curious
UpliftingNews,removed,oh cool now lets even make mental health about race because apparently every single thing in is about race
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,til kentucky dentists want to promote white supremacy and classism by promoting dental care
UpliftingNews,removed,dying in front of a bunch of kids uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,took the words out of my mouth i am going to start a petition to have elon musk sent to mars on a cart strapped to a rocket
UpliftingNews,removed,that this is even necessary in the most powerful economy in the world is pathetic glad hes doing it nevertheless
UpliftingNews,removed,the world is a better place because of you
UpliftingNews,removed,is he a bounty hunter as well
UpliftingNews,removed,shii son nigga gon slay dem doe
UpliftingNews,removed,not paralysed from chest down at least not fully hips are moving and supporting self mechanism may support knees but ankles doing work and supporting dont understand why article claims this
UpliftingNews,removed,what if my name is dick eh subreddit what then
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting this is normal i play paintball with a bunch of guys some are muslim a few others are gay never been an issue to eat together or play together or do anything together the only thing is at bbqs the muslim guys usually bring their own bbq to cook with because theyre not like asshole vegans who demand you never cook meat on your own bbq lol
UpliftingNews,removed,lets give credit where credit is due these nonviolent muslims who seek peace with others are very brave because there is a large percentage of radical muslims out there who would kill them for seeking peace with the rest of us
UpliftingNews,removed,he is almost certainly gay too but coming out as a muslim in his position would not bode well for him
UpliftingNews,removed,this story is really so uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,lmao
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck yeah qld cunt wooo
UpliftingNews,removed,double penis transplant when
UpliftingNews,removed,id expect a cubs fan to support bernie
UpliftingNews,removed,or guy with two broken arms story
UpliftingNews,removed,fingers crossed these hands were not from a serial killer
UpliftingNews,removed,no wonder why my order is always wrong congrats though
UpliftingNews,removed,so this is why trump has baby hands now i feel bad
UpliftingNews,removed,or he could ask his mom for assistance
UpliftingNews,removed,they dont really work though do they hell want them gone soon enough
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah so he could hand it over
UpliftingNews,removed,in other news the worlds first hand transplant recipient was doing very well until his penis rejected it
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean dead kid
UpliftingNews,removed,is it bad that my first thought was how funny it would be if they were put on the wrong arms
UpliftingNews,removed,fake and gay
UpliftingNews,removed,why do we have to bring i k and paper into this
UpliftingNews,removed,zion rules he can get a damn pizza pizza himself
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont watch the vids im only here for the top comments and racial slurs
UpliftingNews,removed,quick somebody check and make sure donald trumps ok
UpliftingNews,removed,funny how this is the one time the body cam didnt seem to malfunction
UpliftingNews,removed,and can now give himself a stranger so theres that
UpliftingNews,removed,kaep still sitting
UpliftingNews,removed,im not finna go back in i dont blame you homie
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet this is the first time the footage didnt get lost
UpliftingNews,removed,i love bodycams people think theyre there to keep officers honest when in reality officers are almost more likely to shoot you if theyre wearing one because they know theyll be proved right when the footage comes out and the police department sees how it all went down if youre not wearing one and you shoot a criminal youre more likely to lose your job if some asshole lies to the media and says the perp held his hands up and said dont shoot when wearing one of the times that the officer is in the right to shoot you hell shoot you if hes not wearing one even if hes in his rights to shoot he might hesitate
UpliftingNews,removed,thank god that bodycam wasnt disabled or somehow broken
UpliftingNews,removed,twenilyna noflivlans road
UpliftingNews,removed,so the cops quickly release this shit yet do everything they can to pass laws to block camera footage when it pertains to them killing someone fuck you neckbeards
UpliftingNews,removed,there is ni propoganda the entire problem isnt that every interaction with police is negative that was never the point the problem is the utter lack of accountability when they arent positive they are the most corrupt agency in the country and its not even a close race they have oversight or accountability that isnt internal and histerically under applied
UpliftingNews,removed,im amazed they didnt lose the video or the cam fell off that happens very very often in situations where the officer is in a situation any situation really where the officer is forced to ex neutralize a bla a person from behind
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean a body camera that actually works and doesnt fall off during the event
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry but video has been reversed cop was actually putting him in the burning car
UpliftingNews,removed,this one wouldnt make the cut he died
UpliftingNews,removed,the anti cop blm bs is setting back a real civil rights issue years if not decades only in the eyes of racist pieces of shit who love them some confirmation bias bullshit from the likes of sean hannity and bill oreilly
UpliftingNews,removed,i wanted to come here and say the comment section on that video was fucking shit then came here and its the bloody same
UpliftingNews,removed,amazing how this video of a cops actions are released
UpliftingNews,removed,makes complete sense
UpliftingNews,removed,ozi indian tv channel
UpliftingNews,removed,dont let the media fool you they reversed this footage
UpliftingNews,removed,rcopsputtingbabiesinfires no it was a long shot
UpliftingNews,removed,police are not supposed to protect thug criminals if you cant handle the punishment dont commit the crime i applaud every police officer who puts down a criminal with just cause the idea that police should risk their lives to protect some wannabe gangsters is idiotic if they dont comply the police have a right to put them down to protect the whole community from them the police are the ones being oppressed from doing their work the only thing these communities are oppressed from is oppressed rom being able to commit crimes without any reprecautions
UpliftingNews,removed,i love that all these good things still happen in the world today
UpliftingNews,removed,black lives didnt matter to the black guy who called the cops while he watched anther black guy burn but they blmattered to the white cop nice spin on the old argument
UpliftingNews,removed,how uplifting a reminder that cops can be trusted to wear their body cams when it makes them look good
UpliftingNews,removed,weird to think that body cams only malfunction or turn themselves off moments before something bad happens
UpliftingNews,removed,i mean the body cam worked for once what a surprise
UpliftingNews,removed,only reason this doesnt have upvotes is because it doesnt back the belief all cops are bad if this showed a cop being slightly mean you would get a crap ton of see see they should all wear it
UpliftingNews,removed,thank god im not a cop that guy would have been roasted ham
UpliftingNews,removed,surprised the cam didnt shut off during the moment of heroism they so often shut off during moments of police brutality
UpliftingNews,removed,so i guess officers do more than just shoot innocent black men huh who wouldve thought
UpliftingNews,removed,tomorrow on the young turks if he was black cop wouldnt have saved him d context
UpliftingNews,removed,funny how these things never malfunction when the cop is doing a good deed
UpliftingNews,removed,good cop extra donuts
UpliftingNews,removed,but fuck all police when it fits the reddit narrative
UpliftingNews,removed,you cant equate the value of a franchise with on field success
UpliftingNews,removed,nobody even yelled out worldstar
UpliftingNews,removed,i just cant believe it stayed on most of the body cam videos i see they turn off right before the action s
UpliftingNews,removed,it literally falls off in the video in this post at least watch the video before getting all uppity
UpliftingNews,removed,odd that police body cams never malfunction when theyre doing so me thing right
UpliftingNews,removed,where was the random passerby shouting worldstar as he broke the window
UpliftingNews,removed,hey the body cam actually worked
UpliftingNews,removed,is that why no one volunteered in chicago for the bodycam program prompting a mandatory selection
UpliftingNews,removed,reality isnt pc thats what i hate about pc culture in general for example to learn about islam i read the koran over a period of a few weeks dont do that if you want to remain pc the book is violent as fuck and has zero redeeming qualities
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel bad for laughing at the cop trying to push his head back inhehe
UpliftingNews,removed,of the general population or less kills people in any given year but guess what we still prosecute the shit out of the people who do your statement is worthless and marginalizes the issue which is criminal cops get away with crimes that no other persons except the insanely rich but thats a different story can get away with your comment suggests that we should never investigate any murderer because that would be categorizing people in general as murderers which isnt true
UpliftingNews,removed,good cop have a donut
UpliftingNews,removed,to be fair race is usually a factor when something bad happens it wasnt a factor in this situation
UpliftingNews,removed,entrapped wtf video maker
UpliftingNews,removed,well i will wait for the follow up video showing his partner throwing him back into the car because i know that is what must have happened
UpliftingNews,removed,funny how they never malfunction when heroics are involved
UpliftingNews,removed,all cops are pigs s
UpliftingNews,removed,its so weird how body cams only seem to work when a cop is going their job correctly
UpliftingNews,removed,floridaman strikes again
UpliftingNews,removed,question why use the term racial bias as opposed to racism
UpliftingNews,removed,body cam for everyone peace
UpliftingNews,removed,no jesus in the new testament specifically says not to war amongst peoples to spread the faith peacefully i dont like the bible but the two faiths are not comparable at all
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet he shot them after
UpliftingNews,removed,dragged him out before shooting him in center mass times
UpliftingNews,removed,so the headline could read cop saves black mans life but that doesnt really fit with current social trends and stereotypes
UpliftingNews,removed,do peckers work
UpliftingNews,removed,weird that the heat didnt make it magically switch off
UpliftingNews,removed,convenient that the bodycam works when they help people but not when they murder people for stealing a gatorade
UpliftingNews,removed,very heroic thank you for what you do
UpliftingNews,removed,braking news racist cops almost kills a boy trapped in a car
UpliftingNews,removed,cant wait for this news story to be totally ignored by everyone so they can still imagine cops as complete jerks who kill for fun
UpliftingNews,removed,its crazy how they seem to work fine when good things happen
UpliftingNews,removed,theres probably a lot more of this than bad things but bad cops get bad press also blm wants all cops to look evil
UpliftingNews,removed,bet youre white
UpliftingNews,removed,this was an employee doing the bare minimum of the job they are paid to do of course that doesnt get as much attention as the terrible fucking murders ya shit bird
UpliftingNews,removed,oh so then they work
UpliftingNews,removed,good call youre supposed to fight fire with fire
UpliftingNews,removed,funny how the camera didnt malfunction or somehow turn off on him
UpliftingNews,removed,black lives matter why didnt the cop shoot that white guy racist
UpliftingNews,removed,he remembered to turn it on neat
UpliftingNews,removed,problem is who pays for them they are not cheap especially the storage id prefer local municipalities decide how to do this and if its needed
UpliftingNews,removed,he actually ran back to the cop car to grab the body cam before he saved her
UpliftingNews,removed,well they werent there obviously they pussied out
UpliftingNews,removed,what ever you do dont read world star hip hop comments
UpliftingNews,removed,working body cams say whaaaa
UpliftingNews,removed,and the same amount of them not working just before someone gets shot
UpliftingNews,removed,i was surprised the cop didnt fear for his life and shoot at the flames
UpliftingNews,removed,what if a police officer has to go to the bathroom
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah leave the body cam on when saving a life or a cat or someone drowning first time he pulls over two black malesall of a sudden my body cam shut off i have no idea why
UpliftingNews,removed,but when they shoot a nigga the bodycam just so happens to fall off ot break
UpliftingNews,removed,wait is that a person of color and the cop didnt shoot him i dont believe it wheres the rest of the video
UpliftingNews,removed,this police brutality is sickening blacklivesmatter sarcasm
UpliftingNews,removed,ahí sí que vivan los gringos o no compadre
UpliftingNews,removed,suvlivesmatter
UpliftingNews,removed,just stop talking read more
UpliftingNews,removed,right or the cop who shot and killed philando castille
UpliftingNews,removed,i think the solution will be for the hospital to ban the body cameras and if the police are required to always have them ban the police from the hospital the police have no duty to censor and phi they record thats entirely on the hospital i imagine it wouldnt be much different than allowing a news crew inside the hospital is responsible for what the film it gets tricky since the police have extra powers compared to the news crew so you cant necessarily tell them cameras off or get off the property
UpliftingNews,removed,then he shoots him right
UpliftingNews,removed,im surprised the body cam didnt malfunction
UpliftingNews,removed,essentially saying but sometimes we break the rules in your favour
UpliftingNews,removed,cops are evil cops are pigs okie dokie
UpliftingNews,removed,you sure for all we know the driver may have been drunk and the guy that was saved could be a drug dealer possibly worth it
UpliftingNews,removed,it turns out this was a reenactment as the bodycam failed as they tend to do
UpliftingNews,removed,the officer was amazing he didnt even wait for the ambulance to wait or other police officers to arrive because he knew that it would be too late what i find amazing is how he was so calm when he got there he got that man out alive and he deserve reorganization for saving this man
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont know whats even going on with the borne movies anymore the plot makes no sense and the shaky cam is getting out of control
UpliftingNews,removed,those cameras are so notorious for malfunctioning when the officers actions are questionable its a good thing theyre always working when theres no controversy
UpliftingNews,removed,isnt it funny how the body cameras dont magically just fall off like in baton rouge when the officer is being a hero
UpliftingNews,removed,you should work on your critical thinking skills
UpliftingNews,removed,i would eat any ticket and cameraequipped cop felt he had to give me rather than a warning if that meant he was less likely to kill an innocent black manboy on a subsequent stop thats a pretty simplistic view of things to be honest
UpliftingNews,removed,downvote because no one said worldstar
UpliftingNews,removed,in the words of hillary at this point why does it matter
UpliftingNews,removed,im just amazed that body camera was able to stay on usually they fuck up in firefights
UpliftingNews,removed,worldstarhiphopcom kill yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,well he was a white cop so he was probably just trying to get his monthly saving a black guy from a fire quota its a shame that thousands of officers dont put their lives and safety on the line for other people but instead focus on pointless government quotas
UpliftingNews,removed,why is the guy trying to get out from the small side window
UpliftingNews,removed,the officer was clearly just trying to expedite that mans death because hes black also ill bet the engineers that designed that suv were all white and were hoping this would happen one
UpliftingNews,removed,the black lives matter twats dont really give a shit didnt they just trash milwaukee or attempt to because a black cop shot an armed black felon in the process of doing some general fuckuppery
UpliftingNews,removed,he must have one of the rare properly working body cams
UpliftingNews,removed,surprised the camera didnt malfunction oh wait that only happens when they kill people
UpliftingNews,removed,had a chance to shout worldstarhiphop didnt get it in there otherwise pretty solid
UpliftingNews,removed,seen video of a cop shoot a man in the neck who had flipped his vehicle in an accident and now this balance has been restored to the universe
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe pussies like you should not subscribe to uplifting news does it make you feel special to make comments about the richies donating for tax haven purposes
UpliftingNews,removed,itt a bunch of morons who pretend to understand the climate
UpliftingNews,removed,isnt the name of the team reenforcing patriarchy just kidding
UpliftingNews,removed,because uneducated plebs
UpliftingNews,removed,your nations sport is american football fuck up

UpliftingNews,removed,wow the fantastical bullshit americans come up with is truly amazing
UpliftingNews,removed,usa has a much much higher population and land mass always with the same tired old excuse how does this higher peoplulation prevent you from doing this do you know what per capita means you just offer aws a blnket excuse for everything without expklaining why it be so you have more parents buty you also have a higher amount of taxpayers to provide for them and landmass you are so big that you cant possible even entertain the idea going to the hospital while pregnant no not even to have birth us is too big for that you are all born in the same mudpit uyou were conceived by your cousin yeah who even needs baby clothes us is too big for clothes anyway you are also too big for a postal service like the us postal service which could at least deliver it if yiou cant go to a hospital for neo natal care or iof only there was a way of splitting us up into say smaller administrative regions you cuold call those regions states
UpliftingNews,removed,are you finnish
UpliftingNews,removed,baseball is respectable
UpliftingNews,removed,if you wanna be technical fucking hilarious just after this to be fair you have shared a country since

UpliftingNews,removed,typical american idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,what does
UpliftingNews,removed,funny how americans never cry about their taxes subsidising your free soda refills you arent clever you are just a stereeotypical american idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,i know what socialism enabled both my parents to go to university and now myself so i guess its working me for me mate
UpliftingNews,removed,are you against socialism or something why are you being so confrontational
UpliftingNews,removed,goodness me why are you so insulting theres no point in trying to patronise with me news articles
UpliftingNews,removed,well i would say that i dont have a good understanding of it do you
UpliftingNews,removed,ou deleted your comment instead of being extremely rude why not explain where the funds come from so everyone can benefit from learning something new why not explain where the funds come from or maybe ytou shouldnt be playing stupid to make a backhanded argument that its paid by taxes of course its paid by tax scotland is not a charity and sturgeon is a politician not the head of some charitable organisation same goes for finland everyone can benefit from learning something new if you were interested in actually learning sometyhing you would read the article but it wasnt a sincere question it was a backhanded comment about taxes paying for it so it as if that isnt completely obvious to everybody outside us already you are just trying to be cute
UpliftingNews,removed,i have heard that the clintons got lots of arab money are they donating to haiti
UpliftingNews,removed,fucking moron
UpliftingNews,removed,do you guys have beds are sleeping bags not just for camping serious question here kinda considered
UpliftingNews,removed,these arent the puppies youre looking for
UpliftingNews,removed,prepare for triggered fatties who else misses rfatpeoplehate
UpliftingNews,removed,thats pretty neat i think she should have dropped more before she did this though
UpliftingNews,removed,fat
UpliftingNews,removed,its ok vfatpeoplehate is the real thing though but its not as good since it doesnt trigger as many people simply by existing
UpliftingNews,removed,still quite fat wouldnt fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,its a fucking joke that women worked for decades to show skin acceptably and now people are championing this shite because theyve got a hard one for minorities
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure a male colleague could give her the required permission or just rape her then he basically owns her afterwards and could then give her the gun

UpliftingNews,removed,maybe if you stop being a bunch of pedos or encouraging pedos to enter the country id give you a century and youd still not notice that no other factors were reported on or acted on how much of what is going on is caused by immigration and weak borders you dont give a shit you dont give a shit that your need to tell random strangers on the internet that youre not a fucking racist is more important to you than the safety of these kids the kids you put in jeopardy by needing to say hey stop arresting people on the border why the fuck would you even do that you fucking oblivious evil twat
UpliftingNews,removed,we fight ideology ideas and chaos that will ultimately end in either the total destruction of on side or the entire destruction of all beligerant parties if we continue on the present course i suggest to you that would be dumb should there be any choices lo there are many not simple or simple to implement but a lot easier than dealing with the aftermath of nuclear war no amount of public opinion has changed the situation to its logical conclusion total war thats a problem dont you think because the american people want more war like they want a colonoscopy they wont support it and its unlikely that allies would support that war so the already exhausted troops face green chinese troops conscription to support another war of choice i dont think thats going to fly the debt to china is one of the bright spots they really dont want to set that money on fire archaic as it seems its still a fortification yeah archaic as it is and mexicans running around digging tunnels and firing heavy calibre potato cannons i dont think it would even require official forces to blow huge holes in it that would give mexico plausible deniability but now you have to invade mexico too so instead of the two front war that put the nail in hitlers coffin not that he needed more than a coffee can trump seems to be aiming for at least three one of which at least is a nuclear power does this seem like a survivable strategic situation to you
UpliftingNews,removed,muḥammad ibn mūsā alkhwārizmī was a muslim but its actually a misconception that he was persian he was actually khwarezmian born in chorasmia which is a region in central asia the people there are khwarezmians an iranian ethnic group now extinct due to turkicmongol migration iranian doesnt mean persian like everyone thinks it does but instead it means aryan the ancestors of the modern iranian peoples such as persians kurds afghans balochis azeris tajiks ossetians etc notice how this does not include arabs
UpliftingNews,removed,that would be the case if this were saudi arabia dont listen to us propaganda iran although a theocracy is much more free than oppressive arab gulf states like saudi arabia
UpliftingNews,removed,thats saudi arabia the only country in the world that does that
UpliftingNews,removed,aww the sjw is triggered you attacked me insulted me havent proven me wrong and now youre a victim why dont you prove me wrong and tell me what you do rather than saying i dont know because im pretty confidant you do jack shit
UpliftingNews,removed,i going to keep this conversation going all day you want to claim i threw baseless accusations after you did it first to be a victim prove me wrong and use your words
UpliftingNews,removed,its sad that you dont know the meaning of the word random in a thread about math its pathetic youre a fucking loser
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean when you let your state fill to the brim with people from mexico it becomes just like mexico shocking
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel sorry for the women forced into head scarfs each morning but maybe theyll have a better chance at emancipation here than in afghanistan well unless of course they are thrown into a muslim community here
UpliftingNews,removed,best quality of products are manufactured by us
UpliftingNews,removed,im not surprised the us seems to just be handing out pats on the backs to traitors these days
UpliftingNews,removed,uhshe got fired for not doing her job so they are giving her a participation trophy huh dumb ass liberals absolute wastes of flesh
UpliftingNews,removed,of course so courageous what a load of bs he should of fired her out of a cannon instead
UpliftingNews,removed,liberals are just in the business of handing out participation trophies these days since they have nothing else to do other than name call and riot in the street
UpliftingNews,removed,cool propaganda bro want to bring it to the white house
UpliftingNews,removed,heres a hint the democratic political party has blurred the lines so much between the two its almost impossible to make a distinction the democratic party today has lost their collective minds well what little rational thought they actually had has flown out the window heres another hint id jump ship while you still have the chance if you align with any of these deranged people cheers heres to trump
UpliftingNews,removed,years ago why
UpliftingNews,removed,i would donate a piece of my liver to the nanny because thats the only way a little piece of me will ever be inside her

UpliftingNews,removed,i would be more than happy to provide that baby sitter with some parts of my own
UpliftingNews,removed,that nanny looks like she can suck a mean cock
UpliftingNews,removed,people these days will do anything for attention what a selfish bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,according to their laws its perfectly acceptable to bury her up to her neck and throw rocks at her skill until shes dead no trial think about that
UpliftingNews,removed,little fcker doesnt even look grateful

UpliftingNews,removed,watch hillary show httpsyoutubeuxhldloicy
UpliftingNews,removed,watch hillary show httpsyoutubeuxhldloicy
UpliftingNews,removed,nannys sure look different these days
UpliftingNews,removed,really fucking really it took until now to realize im trolling that doesnt mean im wrong though because in this instance you are the one who is wrong so there
UpliftingNews,removed,you might want to take a moment and slow your roll when it comes to assumptions about people my astonishment at your belief that you somehow know what is best for everyone else really has nothing to do with my username its fine if you want to and are able to reduce your own actions and feelings to simple logic good on you if thats your thing but who are you to decide for anyone other than yourself what is important or unnecessary in someone elses life
UpliftingNews,removed,i apologize for saying this in such a holy land of happiness but that is not the same cat for my personal reference ive done well above average on facial recognition tests and im also incredibly addicted to my cat and stare at him all day long as well as our other three cats in the house who i can distinctly see for their subtleties this woman might even have face blindness or more likely a deep desire to lie to herself after searching for years the cat on the photo on the bed is blatantly not the same cat for a cat thats years old its not going to have a dark orange face turn almost beige the lines above its eyes are also in a very different pattern and the width of the head between the ears in just not the same i admit the new cat is adorable and if thats the only picture of the original one on the bed id say the newer one is even cuter it has a baby face like my baby boy and im sure this new cat will fill a void in her life its just not the same cat ignorance can be her bliss but i prefer the truth
UpliftingNews,removed,i was thinking fuck she found me that bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,this is why dogs are better they run around for a couple hours at most then come back cats just say fuck you food dispenser ill go get my own
UpliftingNews,removed,stupid cat
UpliftingNews,removed,whatever makes you feel good about yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,can the cat even remember her after years shit they give up on their kittens if they cant find them after weeks if they see them weeks later they completely ignore them hard to believe the cat would have any idea who she was
UpliftingNews,removed,did she check the tail for spray paint
UpliftingNews,removed,i fuck her the owner of the cat lol
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah id like to think if it were her dog shed lost the dog would be super stoked to see her but cats gonna cat
UpliftingNews,removed,i swear to god if i hear one more thing about these stupid angel shots
UpliftingNews,removed,ur dog ded
UpliftingNews,removed,he ded
UpliftingNews,removed,what if the girls a psycho and the guy needs help
UpliftingNews,removed,wish they had these for guys the amount of psychos that would catfish online is insane i had one try to follow me home sort of sexist they dont have this for guys too
UpliftingNews,removed,conservatives must really hate this restaurant
UpliftingNews,removed,your an idiot have a great day🤗😔
UpliftingNews,removed,its this sort of misguided common sense thinking that causes so many problems the uss prison system is among the harshest in the first world and has one of the highest recidivism rates almost reoffend within five years most prisoners leave prison worse off than how they came in and have accomplished no personal growth nor attained any valuable skills necessary to reenter society its no wonder they reoffend so often
UpliftingNews,removed,if you go to seaworld in i hope you get cancer on your taint
UpliftingNews,removed,youre right about that but that isnt the whole picture the large majority of prisons are stateowned and operated and prisoners housed in those prisons also have high recidivism rates the problem is our national attitude about acceptable treatment of prisoners and a whole host of factors out in the real world that make it extremely difficult to reenter society in a legitimate manner the fact of the matter is that a lot of excons leave prison bitter lacking any applicable skills connected to a huge network of other criminals and having great difficulty acquiring work housing loans education etc people need to eat so if they cant feed themselves by legally acquired means theyll fall back into crime no surprises there
UpliftingNews,removed,if you had read the rest of his comment youd realize theres more there to respond to he even says that punishment works well as a deterrent for certain types of crimes but far less effectively for others youre intentionally not trying to learn anything to preserve your ego
UpliftingNews,removed,try again at what exactly plenty of other people here pointing out how stupid of a statement you made ill let them have a try eh
UpliftingNews,removed,also drug addiction is spectrum and some addicts can handle themselves without the drug or they are aware of the financial burden and maintain their job as a means of feeding their addiction and leading a functioning life
UpliftingNews,removed,punishment has never deterred crime we have the largest prison population in the world the longest sentencing for drug crimes as well as the largest population of addicts in the world in america this has had the counter effect of deterrence where as countries where it is legal have very few issues in comparison its not even a question anymore its fairly well known throughout the world the fact that you believe what you state can only lead to one logical conclusion you sir are an idiot there is no nice way to say it so have a great day🤗😞
UpliftingNews,removed,if punishment worked for some you wouldnt have the insane amount of recidivism you see in the us
UpliftingNews,removed,oh almost everyone with a brain whose never read statistics related to recidivism ftfy
UpliftingNews,removed,democrats arent trying to take your guns you fucking moron they are trying to enact sensible gun control laws very fucking different
UpliftingNews,removed,i replied to the wrong person my apologies
UpliftingNews,removed,wow spoken like the true racist woman hater you are reddit never ceases to amaze me we are surrounded by bigots like
UpliftingNews,removed,give me time fuck sakes
UpliftingNews,removed,congrats you know how to make screenshots doesnt change the fact youre a fucking moron
UpliftingNews,removed,no different to offering scholarshipsbenefits to minorities or immigrants im just above the income line for medicaid in my state think that doesnt chap my ass that if i was just a little poorer the government would give me more money for school and healthcare
UpliftingNews,removed,and further proof that capatalism that does not support the poor leads to higher crime rates give people an income and a job and they will not have a reason to offend it amazes me that we see proof of this over and iver yet we still seem to scared to tax a few ricb people more in order to help poor comunities get out of the perpetual cycle
UpliftingNews,removed,im for rehab but for things like rape and murder there has to be a little more punishment you cant just ruin someones life or end one and get off with some rehab there needs to be honest evaluation of who is deserving of rehab which imo is of criminals
UpliftingNews,removed,re offending being caught wonder how many boogers are in the food lets be honest if youre unable to control yourself to the point that you get arrested for your behavior then youre unable to control yourself with peoples food
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,find a lawyer and have your it expunged from your record already
UpliftingNews,removed,and stop fucking locking people up for victimless crimes
UpliftingNews,removed,absolutely brilliant restaurant with the finest food and most professional staff and atmosphere we ate at edwins on christmas eve and it was top notch eating here is eating at one of the finest it is not just going because you want to support a fine idea brandon is such an amazing example to everyone of what quality leadership is about he inspires everyone makes all guests feel special and even manages to fill water glasses if he spots a half full one thats leading by example
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,rthathappened
UpliftingNews,removed,op ularryemartinez is a fag
UpliftingNews,removed,yes fuck them
UpliftingNews,removed,you are truly an idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,does no one check usernames im not the same guy youve been responding to so no im not mad at all i just think youre an idiot an impressive idiot in fact
UpliftingNews,removed,exarmy medic ex emt gave years of my life to the army and years volunteering as an emt while working my last years as an emt ive donated more of my time money and life to helping people than you have even experienced yet you sound like one of the people who made me hate working with emts and firefighters you believe your career choice makes you better than others if you want to get a pat on the back for doing something you are doing it for the wrong reason
UpliftingNews,removed,do you have some evidence to show that this is not true its known as being true in cleveland people love to debunk shit dont ya think someone by now would have said something how much are you willing to put on the table im willing to take your why because i have faith someone would have already debunked this
UpliftingNews,removed,so you actually thought i was mad because i called you an idiot lol
UpliftingNews,removed,dicks out for harambe
UpliftingNews,removed,once again proving that cleveland is the best city in america
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah i want people to love cleveland the problem is if they love it they will come here and ruin it that shithead with the til why do we want his kind in cleveland at all
UpliftingNews,removed,no most criminals were just drug users who society has demonized and decided to lock up and they decided to do this for the purpose of destroying the economic power and voice of minorities and the poor they werent trespassing against anyone to begin with they were living life and the nanny state under the guise of public health made war upon them it is a minority of criminals who are actually trespassing against others due to desperation
UpliftingNews,removed,this is truly good it lets so many people see that these people are just people some may have gone wrong but almost all of them want to redeem themselves and should always be given a chance unlike what the government does to them
UpliftingNews,removed,so far applies to you as well can you tell the future do you know anyone can murder in the right circumstances dont talk shit buddy
UpliftingNews,removed,did you really have to make this a race thing cant we all just enjoy that someone is doing something to help better the lives of people
UpliftingNews,removed,just keep an eye on your wallet when dining there
UpliftingNews,removed,youve got to be kidding me well played
UpliftingNews,removed,thank you that was roughly what i was getting at i just couldnt articulate it well and now im drunk and its even more difficult but thanks for getting it
UpliftingNews,removed,ok
UpliftingNews,removed,yes because the body cam video is going to turn hesaid shesaid into definite proof of abuse and thats going to make the payouts higher not lower
UpliftingNews,removed,thats the exact opposite of whats happening so far at departments that have body cams no its not theres no evidence of anything happening yet because of body cams except for fewer complaints about police being called in in the places where the cameras are used and thats a good thing so are the cameras but lawsuits and settlements take years to process this is the sort of number that really wont be available for a decade i still think they are necessary i just think the claims of financial benefits are exaggerated and possibly nonexistent as there is no logic behind them sort of like when we were all told obamacare was going to lower insurance premiums and mine doubled
UpliftingNews,removed,chea fam tbh fyr
UpliftingNews,removed,fool me once shame on you fool me twice you fool me once you cant fool me again bush
UpliftingNews,removed,for whatever reason these bodycams dont malfunction nearly as often when cops do awesome shit
UpliftingNews,removed,its a factor because they make it one just as often as not
UpliftingNews,removed,what
UpliftingNews,removed,clearly you are an expert as you have seen an example of a grease fire
UpliftingNews,removed,to put it in perspective thats the choice that the guy that called the police saidso yeah props to the officer
UpliftingNews,removed,but ive been told everyday by friends family media and everyone that every cop is evil
UpliftingNews,removed,its other than black life it doesnt matter
UpliftingNews,removed,oh the bodycam video wasnt corrupted somehow then deleted what are the chances
UpliftingNews,removed,not the right place man
UpliftingNews,removed,it could be turned off remotely by dispatch surely theres already a for gotta use the can
UpliftingNews,removed,i didnt find it uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,httpimgurcomcqsgnid
UpliftingNews,removed,sure but will they be playing it for the best that the bad apples who happen to be a subreddit dedicated to these acts soon
UpliftingNews,removed,hes the backward pixel hacker jesus we just explained it
UpliftingNews,removed,and then beating him mercilessly after realizing the victim was a minority consistent with his police training at the academy
UpliftingNews,removed,hispanics will slowly integrate into becoming considered white much like the irish poles and others before them the black population however has too much baggage from slaverysegregation preventing something similar from happening
UpliftingNews,removed,you just strongly implied that they were so uh yeah fix your phrasing or own it you cant have it both ways
UpliftingNews,removed,many departments engage in randomized supervisory review when i was a dispatcher my calls were randomly selected for review at different levels
UpliftingNews,removed,wow thanks for the shootout im really glad someone took something away from that
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,more like that cop is a real american hero funny thing is a lot of people say to me that i am their hero i mean the cop is great but he hasnt created jobs i want to see more cops creating jobs and selling real estate like the true heros of america
UpliftingNews,removed,so these peasants can literally shit on your money donald trump next week
UpliftingNews,removed,funny how his body cam didnt mysteriously turn off during this because that seems to happen a lot
UpliftingNews,removed,well this doesnt look good on cops should of quickly sharpie the dude black racist
UpliftingNews,removed,im tired of people giving cops props for things like this hooray you did your fucking job for once
UpliftingNews,removed,the officer wasnt worried he noticed the individual was hispanic as trump said and knew there wasnt enough gas in the tank for it to blow up
UpliftingNews,removed,probably pepper sprayed him a minute later
UpliftingNews,removed,do you think a female cop would have done this well
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel like someone should do a reverse of this video showing the cop somersaulting putting the man back in the burning car and then using his reverso fire extinguisher to make more fire before calmly getting back in his car and reversing away
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah but he shot him in the head times as soon as he was safe
UpliftingNews,removed,yup it dis not malfunction in fire
UpliftingNews,removed,a body can video without only cut seconds of a cop firing his gunnn
UpliftingNews,removed,the poor kid already has autism now theyre forcing him to eat with football players from fsu
UpliftingNews,removed,your own confirmation bias and ignorance
UpliftingNews,removed,being good at calculus is just memorization and knowing basic trig but mostly memorization of derivatives
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry op but he needs to be black female andor muslim to get recognition on reddit a fucking white male succeeding is deemed racist
UpliftingNews,removed,they sure keep their body cams on for shit like this but pulling over a black driver they turn those cams off real quick
UpliftingNews,removed,woah a shocker that this body cam footage made it fine through a fire and a dramatic rescue looks like the only time that the bodycam doesnt work is when theyve killed a black guy weird coincidence
UpliftingNews,removed,stronk pussy
UpliftingNews,removed,when youre you have no life sure you can study
UpliftingNews,removed,this kid is so getting laid
UpliftingNews,removed,white privilege everybody this kid doesnt have it as bad as a black person does
UpliftingNews,removed,couldnt tell from the thumbview but was mildly surprised that the kid wasnt chinesekoreanindian
UpliftingNews,removed,blacksuvsmatter
UpliftingNews,removed,i wasnt that surprised but i was pretty happy it was definitely the final obstacle said dean who received his score in july oh cmon
UpliftingNews,removed,nerd
UpliftingNews,removed,this kid looks like hell grow up to be an entitled gender fluid sjw we dont need any more of those
UpliftingNews,removed,family seems like riamverysmart material
UpliftingNews,removed,good on you kid betcha this kid isnt going to major in anything retarded like anthropology ethnic studies or rtf
UpliftingNews,removed,why are asians at the frontline for nearly every academic achievement
UpliftingNews,removed,the most shocking thing about this story the kid isnt asian
UpliftingNews,removed,intelligence like this is innate not like the kid woke up one day knowing how to differentiate equations he had to work on this too im sure
UpliftingNews,removed,some notes tons of people get i got a really easily as did many in my ap calc class its not like this kid got the best score out of anyone calculus is not even hard at all when it comes to hard math subjects we just teach math at such a retarded rate that when kids learn ahead of the curve it seems impressive calculus is literally the next step after you get a firm grasp on functions polynomials it is memorization of techniques specific examples especially calc is almost entirely focused on rates of change i feel like given the opportunity i could have easily been learning calculus by that age
UpliftingNews,removed,comments on that video are cancer
UpliftingNews,removed,this little punk shat on my cat
UpliftingNews,removed,rpunchablefaces sorry
UpliftingNews,removed,this is just his privilege showing any black child could do this im sure if they werent continually oppressed and what has he ever done for social justice he will be just another patriarch i suspect
UpliftingNews,removed,nerd
UpliftingNews,removed,intelligence is a virtue i disagree and the world does too see i was in a similar boat had to be pulled out of regular math classes and into independent study at age largely because boredom was turning me into a horribly disruptive little shit in my defense i had the maturity of a tenyearold took calc ab around my birthday and should have stretched for bc because the following year was all review again on both fortunately by i had enough maturity to not be a horrible disruptive little shit anymore but but i had made a really bad decision after experiencing extreme hostility from the public school district about my math needs there were certainly no newspaper stories about me i had chosen or at least agreed to transfer to a fairly expensive catholic prep school kids if you think you might be even a little queer dont do that sure the lesbian catholic schoolgirl thing might sound like its fun but it really isnt if you take their moralizing seriously and shove yourself into the deepest closet you can find it was hell there were some good parts i had intellectual peers and didnt have to be the extreme top of the class anymore the top is way more comfortable than top but even so i was so utterly sick of school that i wanted nothing to do with college this has been a bad decision too but much less bad than high school was for one thing my intellectual difficulties are now noticeable enough that maybe i can get some help with them i cant do repetition over an extended period of time it puts me in a daze and causes minor hallucinations this wasnt obvious until after it lost me my first job and then another and another this wasnt a problem in school because school is mostly an extended test of reading comprehension and that strength covered for my focus problems starting at around age i tried really hard to get my parents and teachers to understand that there was something weird happening in my brain they tested my iq and told me to stop bothering them gonna cut it off here because im getting more bitter than id like to be but this has been my experience as a mere borderline genius my iq is somewhere around i feel really sorry for the crowd
UpliftingNews,removed,asian mother
UpliftingNews,removed,islamophobia
UpliftingNews,removed,must be half asian
UpliftingNews,removed,because it was a media ploy by the kids family for attention playing off of school bombing fearsislamophobia he didnt actually make it nor did he have any idea how circuits actually worked as evidenced by his answers in interviews
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and you can do anything s
UpliftingNews,removed,parents played the victim everybody acted like this was an extremely racist event but left out the part where a teacher stopped him and said hey dont take that out of your backpack because it looks really sketchy also he was getting praised as an inventor but he just took a clock out of its case and put it in a briefcase despite all that he met the president got a formal apology from essentially everyone and scholarships
UpliftingNews,removed,ap calculus like most things is really easy if youre willing to just study number one reason i graduated college with a instead of a in engineering i didnt really try that hard if i didnt know the answer to a question it wasnt usually because i didnt comprehend it it was because i just didnt study things enough to remember it when it comes to calculus tests im pretty sure this kid isnt just figuring out complex derivatives and integrals on the spot these tests usually require you to just remember and recognize a rather complex form and say hey this looks like a integral of tanx cosx or something like that and the reason you know it is because you did problems like it already and are naturally expecting and looking for it in a test its not like the kid figured out all of calculus on his own
UpliftingNews,removed,i mean apart from indonesians being the best kind of asian thats sarcasm for all the sensitive people maybe chinese
UpliftingNews,removed,lol how many salty tears did you wipe before slipping in the ad hominem attack at the end because you had no substantive grounds for a response
UpliftingNews,removed,im surprised hes not asian
UpliftingNews,removed,considering that average intelligence has gone down not too surprising most people nowadays are simply knowledgable but not particularly smart or witty
UpliftingNews,removed,i felt like an asshole but httpswwwlinkedincompubdiramycureton petes is from harvard university and amys is from the university of pennsylvania
UpliftingNews,removed,i could give you a list of things you memorize those things and you could probably pass a calculus class with most of them are like sinxcosx and tanxcotx exex chain rule quotient rule u substitution about defintions its literally all memorization yes any year old could learn it if you can memorize a chore list you can do calculus
UpliftingNews,removed,i got a c in a business calculus course i took at a community college fuck this kid
UpliftingNews,removed,any atlanta resident reading this would scoff at this being uplifting news buckhead is a pretty upscale part of the city nice arts district and everything is it uplifting that southerners know how to read or something
UpliftingNews,removed,where will he be in years burned out and a drug addict
UpliftingNews,removed,taking calc this semester fuck this kid congrats to him though i wish i had taken calculus in middle or high school
UpliftingNews,removed,intelligence is a virtue but selfishness and apathy will get you further times or is what you need to make use of intelligence
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder how hard he was beaten honestly good job tho
UpliftingNews,removed,i kinda feel bad for him hell be told his entire adolescence that hes great and special than once he gets thrown into the real world he wont get that notoriety anymore and turn to a life of drinking
UpliftingNews,removed,ditch the glasses nerd
UpliftingNews,removed,cool clock ahmed why dont you bring it to the white house
UpliftingNews,removed,humble brag is humble
UpliftingNews,removed,fukin nerd
UpliftingNews,removed,because indians are the new trend since muslims are getting a bad rap
UpliftingNews,removed,prose before hos
UpliftingNews,removed,he just has so much white privilege s
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah right this kid isnt asian
UpliftingNews,removed,pete works as a private equity investor and amy is a business consultant is a subject of debate in the family pete said yes huge shocker that he falls into math to try and get attention from a careerminded family ha ha ha
UpliftingNews,removed,he was basically prepubescent islamic version of ryan lochte its funny because reddit supports ryan i think its because he isnt brown and has a normal name
UpliftingNews,removed,intelligence like this is innate no its not i could teach my year old nephew to do calculus if he was willing to put in the time and practice that this kid probably does sure the kid is probably intelligent but not to some extreme degree this is an example of spending most of his time preparing for a test and studying calculus
UpliftingNews,removed,we will never hear from him again and in years he will accomplish nothing
UpliftingNews,removed,hes going to make a great employee for the kid in school who is learning street smarts and personal skills
UpliftingNews,removed,dude my hours of starcraft playtime doesnt even match hr of playtime from a korean kid
UpliftingNews,removed,dont worry you never ever hear about these kids later in life it makes a flashy news story and they go on to be normal adults or even low functioning adults you never hear stephen hawking or elon musk was doing calculus when he was eleven kids are really good at memorizing things you ever meet a kid who can name all pokemon how they evolve where to find them etc ive known a lot of children with savant like knowledge on one subject that interests them bugs monster trucks whatever and childrens brains are much more geared for learning than ours this kid just probably really likes math or praise from their parents for doing so well at something and memorized all the rules like its a game
UpliftingNews,removed,hyperwealthy private school in the hyperwealthy buckhead neighborhood not accomplished at an atlanta public school
UpliftingNews,removed,would suck if this kid peaked at years old
UpliftingNews,removed,says a lot poor kid
UpliftingNews,removed,good luck find a job with the degrees that dont require calculus
UpliftingNews,removed,this kid should be an inspiration to redditors not a talking point for bitters to mull over with variants on i couldve done that if i hadnt put my hours into starcraft instead im not as eloquent as yourself but i just wanted to say i despise anyone that claims this its almost insulting to people that spend their time putting the work in instead of playing a video game i remember a friend of mine told me about his hours spent in wow and then he read about the hours it would take to become some sort of medical practitioner and he said something like wow if i took the amount of hours i spend in wow and put them into school id be x profession but thats not how it works wow was a leisure activity he did for fun to blow off steam not everybody in the world takes what they do leisurely and substitutes that time with work im sure there are people that can but id more likely bet that the majority of the world would have found another leisure activity or release rather than pick up a text book and go hard in the paint on becoming a rocket scientistbrain surgeon im confident if he wasnt playing wow hed be smoking weed and watching tv
UpliftingNews,removed,obviously the kid is intelligent but an ap is not crushing it high schools have devalued ap exams to the point where scoring under a in an ap class means either you or your teacher sucked i got a on all of my aps without ever looking at the practice booklets because my teachers were great and those that sucked just required knowing how to game the tests ap euro then ap american had essays where certain graders would hate some essays those were worse than stuff like calc and trig this doesnt mean he understands calc just that he knew enough for the test ap is like a college calc if you memorize you can do it there are kids his age and even younger who can do that but give them vector and multi variable and they explode
UpliftingNews,removed,this was once me same thing i have a iq but that isnt extremely uncommon in itself there are a lot of people in the usa and lots of people with high iqs in short this accomplishment is owed to my parents putting me in accelerated education programs after school and in the summer i liked them and did well i think many other young people would be able to do this if they had similar education and enjoyed the subject matter
UpliftingNews,removed,knock knock whose there fuck off with your smarts and all
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck you kid
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting news was he going to did if he didnt pass the test at the age of
UpliftingNews,removed,eek barba durple somebodys gonna get laid in college
UpliftingNews,removed,hes asian shocker
UpliftingNews,removed,well the kid is half asian
UpliftingNews,removed,as someone who sucks at math fuck this kid
UpliftingNews,removed,intelligence is a virtue i could not disagree more intelligence is a gift there are plenty of intelligent people with very low moral standards their intelligence does not entitle them to higher moral ground
UpliftingNews,removed,i cant do math for shitlack the will to study math at all fuck off kid and yo parents good job and great for you but still fuck you you no life
UpliftingNews,removed,plenty of those kids have way more exciting lives than you
UpliftingNews,removed,lol you sure i took ap calc sophomore year and got a too except my parents were broke immigrants
UpliftingNews,removed,who did minkus bang
UpliftingNews,removed,weak shit
UpliftingNews,removed,i was honestly shocked beyond belief to see what appears to be a white kid with a white sounding name adopted by indians perhaps jews one of the of muslims that excels at math and science rather than shun them this makes no sense either he was adopted or he cheated
UpliftingNews,removed,ive been saying for years that theres no purpose to those lower level maths they were a waste of time and different at every school it should be mandatory that algebra i be taught in sixth grade and then follow the chain of maths up all those other maths are a waste of time
UpliftingNews,removed,yes during this time they should practice conditioning for success and failure cycles and creative problem solving thats what really drives success in the adult world the fear of failure is a big deal and it is the primary reason most people cant go beyond their conventional path like getting a bachelors then working gaining pay a year what i mean specifically is to have the kid do projects that are slightly too difficult for him at first you show him techniques for how to solve problems and overcome roadblocks etc the more he deals with the bad feelings involved with failure and roadblocks the better hell be able to handle that stress as an adult the more he practice skills for problem solving on his own the better hell be later because when youre an adult nobody is going to help you even if they could i would probably start him on electronic circuits and programming since there are tons of ways to refine the resulting product and many many road blocks along the way the kid in op learned calculus so what hes not going to do shit with it grinding academics will create another academic it doesnt necessary create an individual capable of other things the chance of him being a mathematician of note is extremely slim too its not a great path and is almost a waste of natural intellect most child math geniuses dont become terence tao
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah im sorry but buckhead doesnt fucking count as atlanta this title makes it seem like this kid is some sort of inner city math virtuoso
UpliftingNews,removed,hes not even asian or indian impressive
UpliftingNews,removed,i chose too wide of a brush not everyone who goes to westminster or similar schools is loaded my wife and i debated on sending our kids there we opted to have my wife stay home and send them to a strong public school in northern gwinnett county no regrets but i see the difference we have friends who opted for christian private schools public schools home schools and what ill call academic private schools differentiating a lot of what im calling christian private schools are not that strong academically seeking to instill christian values and avoid negative influences so westminster is what im calling an academic private school they are about excellence launching their student to high levels of academic acheivement top colleges etc all fine and good but this is definitionally privelege the privilege of having enough money to afford what is certainly one of the best schools at least as would be considered best by a lot of people with the high tuition they are able to hire the best teachers teachers make a big difference and of course smaller class sizes and everything else the smart people running the school have thought of to help in that mission does this mean the students who excel are somehow less excellent of course not excellence is excellence and is never achieved without a mixture of effort intelligence and opportunity but roughly half the student in the country go to below average schools which are a far cry from westminster would this highachieving student have had so much acheivement if he had gone to a public school in a small town in georgia if his parents no if his only parent worked to jobs and a grandmother kept him the rest of the time the answer is maybe some bright kids do make it despite not having much money great schools or parental support but probably not point is the privileged parents ticked me off by being so completely oblivious to privilege please try to understand what i am saying it took me a long time for me to realize how privileged i am and what advantages i have yes others had more but many others have had less and where you start greatly correlates with how far you rise there are exceptions both directions but the general correlation is strong the parents could have praised the school and excellent teachers they could have said they are so proud of how hard he worked they could have even talked about how lucky or blessed they are to have good jobs and afford such a good school but no they dont know maybe its genetics maybe they are just better breeding stock is there not an element of racism but the hidden racism aside its the blindness to privilege by the privileged that rankles i hope you see in this some food for thought
UpliftingNews,removed,big fucking deal the rate of on the ap calc exam is over s
UpliftingNews,removed,they learn to cheat so young
UpliftingNews,removed,i big boy and made poopie in the potty today
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah no way hes the youngest one of them maybe but were running into exaggeration territory here i myself got on ap chem and ap calc ab at its not that uncommon a percentage of homeschoolers do it on top of students getting extracurricular help from parents like this guy probably did and it adds up
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck that kid i had to struggle through it
UpliftingNews,removed,i think its a combination of talent opportunity and hard work his family is smart and highly educated on both sides inherited innate talent both of his parents are financially well off it seems can provide opportunities and he has the desire ambition to achieve hard work
UpliftingNews,removed,not an asian kid impossible
UpliftingNews,removed,neeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrddddddddddddddd jk gj
UpliftingNews,removed,its cause hes asian and all asians are smart filthyfranktv

UpliftingNews,removed,dicks out for this kid i also just took the ap bc exam and got a and it was hard as fuck props man keep up the good work 👌💯
UpliftingNews,removed,celebrating this is like celebrating how fortunate some people in america are i call it privilege if i had this kids education and resources i would have done the same or better no doubt this is not to take away from the achievement just to point out how stupid it is to celebrate it
UpliftingNews,removed,hes asian right
UpliftingNews,removed,and stretched out jeans from thick wallets
UpliftingNews,removed,why the fuck did they name him dean
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck off kid with parents that have graduated from prestigious universities what is so surprising next we are going to recognize a bunch of youngsters paying their dues trust me anyone with well educated parents can match your success and possible even excel kudos for your work but your minutes are done next
UpliftingNews,removed,throw in lots of doctors therapists psychiatrists and depression and you will be pretty spot on
UpliftingNews,removed,his eyes are a little too round maybe just the excitement
UpliftingNews,removed,fucking nerd
UpliftingNews,removed,if you think it isnt then you back it up when somebody says the sky is blue and water is wet nobidy expects them to back it up its the idiots like you calling the sky technically white that need to back it up education inflation is a real problem for the us the education to cost to value ratios are all screwed up for where they were a generation ago and even further from a generation before that
UpliftingNews,removed,i think this should be uplifted
UpliftingNews,removed,i didnt know cockroaches could get high why is this in uplifting news the only way anything from turkey can ever be uplifting is if its erdogan dying and the kurds being given their land
UpliftingNews,removed,communist pig
UpliftingNews,removed,sure friend yeah ok fatty mcfatface
UpliftingNews,removed,it takes a village yeah if you are a lazy shitty parent
UpliftingNews,removed,kids are so full of shit i use to save my lunch money take the free pb no jelly even sanwich and the free milks and take my to and play street fighter and the guy bob was seriouly a legend at that game he knew how to do the handcuffs with guile and i watched him beat kids with one hand he would use his thumb on the joystick and press buttons with other finers and wreck all these kids when we were kids we had a good life now all these kids are playing pokemon and being robbed so sad anyways in america the school will give you free food
UpliftingNews,removed,most school districts have free and reduced lunch anyways for people who cant afford it
UpliftingNews,removed,just an fyi the us government created the national school lunch program during the truman administration all that kids parents have to do is apply to get free or reducedprice lunches all year long this story is mindboggling
UpliftingNews,removed,thats because theyre poor not because theyre a close knit community thats frankly ridiculous
UpliftingNews,removed,should have given him half a lunch the rest already goes to that other kid and their mother through our taxes
UpliftingNews,removed,how much do you think each person would have if we all shared equally do some people deserve more than others
UpliftingNews,removed,i do as well i think its called faith in humanity well at least part of it
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet you have you could spare what you want is for others to be forced to help them which isnt righteous or moral at all
UpliftingNews,removed,narcissistic assholes breed narcissistic asshole children those children flock towards like minded assholes
UpliftingNews,removed,sweden has a fraction of the population of america american not understanding the consept of per capita shocker
UpliftingNews,removed,shes fat would not bang
UpliftingNews,removed,shes in syria where the veil isnt compulsory assad even banned the veil in certain public spaces shes also kurdish and they generally take a less conservative attitude to religion in several other muslim countries its banned in publicly owned buildings and such
UpliftingNews,removed,shes not wearing a burqa shes showing her face and she doesnt fucking wanna show you her hair so fucking deal with damn
UpliftingNews,removed,on that note about syria muslims and christains and kurds dont wear hijab in cities where theyre mixed my muslim wife is from qamishli and nobody there cares about forcing hijab there are kurds muslims christains and aremnian refugees but go to aleppo and muslims wont talk to a girl with no hijab
UpliftingNews,removed,so no one cared for the poor bastard when he was alive but when he died people wanted to feel good about themselves so they go there it makes me even sadder they should find one that hasnt died instead and cheer him up
UpliftingNews,removed,kinda pointless its not like he cares
UpliftingNews,removed,its great but i dont see the point i mean they are dead its a lovely gesture but ultimately pointless
UpliftingNews,removed,the fuck were all you when this amazing woman was alive for years she was hospitalbound where were the visitors then no birthday christmas get well soon cards but its ok to go to this nice ladys funeral you all make me sick the only people who feel better for this is you you selfish fucks clearly some mother fuckers in murica need to learn to care for the people that have fought to keep your ass free and heres the important bit whilst theyre still around i bet she died thinking that noone gave two fucks go give yourself a pat on the back for showing everyone else that you want them to think you care want to make a real difference want to show these fine men and women we have remaining to us and there are fewer every year just how much what they did means to you and how proud of them you are shit go talk to a vet theyve got some fucking amazing stories to tell i personally guarantee that the only thing youll regret is that youve been so far up your own asses that youve not done it sooner and fuck the dont be a dick rule you were all dicks when you decided to circlejerk each other for pretending to care about probably an amazing and very likeable woman who fought and probably knew friends whod died fighting for your fekking right to be circlejerkingneckbeardhipsterdouchbags and at her funeral of all things for shame rant
UpliftingNews,removed,why does it matter hes dead doesnt know and if he did somehow know on a metaphysical level then he probably doesnt give a shit
UpliftingNews,removed,if you want to have a positive impact on these people before they die volunteer with your local va showing up to a funeral doesnt help anyone but yourself httpwwwvolunteervagov
UpliftingNews,removed,i think the fear of dying alone and having an empty funeral is absurd thats the reason i find this story pointless in the first place
UpliftingNews,removed,for rupliftingnews the comments here arent very uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,how about a program where people come out and do things for living vets who have no family funerals are for the benefit of the living not the dead
UpliftingNews,removed,would have been a lot fucking nicer if theyd showed up before he died
UpliftingNews,removed,bet he would have loved to have one of those people visit when he was alive
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile misanthropes cover their eyes and continue to pretend to be intellectuals
UpliftingNews,removed,speaking as an iraq veteran i dont really have much investment in what happens at my funeralmemorialwhatever or even if there is one in the first place i wont care ill be dead it would sure be nice if anybody gave a fuck about me while im still alive though
UpliftingNews,removed,speaking as an iraq veteran i dont really have much investment in what happens at my funeralmemorialwhatever or even if there is one in the first place i wont care ill be dead it would sure be nice if anybody gave a fuck about me while im still alive though
UpliftingNews,removed,but they only care when youre dead and they can use your death as a way to masturbate about how patriotic they are
UpliftingNews,removed,what a negative thing to say im simply being realistic reality has no bias either way its just reality
UpliftingNews,removed,your talking to a vet who is the grandson of two vetsfor fucks sake trust me they didnt give two shits about who was at their funerals when they were in boxes feet in the ground and neither will i when i am a pile of ashes what i do hope for is that if misfortune takes away everything and everyone i have maybe just maybe there will be people out there kind and selfless enough who can and want to help it matters more how people live not what happens after they dieand that poor lady lived alone and that is the important part not some random folks who showed up too late and for one daybetter late than never is bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,i think the rebuttal being made is that this sort of caring is about as caring as facebook activism
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet they all had big chubby liberty boners and the air was visibly thick with smug murica
UpliftingNews,removed,this is rupliftingnews and there are a lot of shitty cynical assholes posting in this thread how disappointing
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet his corpse is really happy
UpliftingNews,removed,well you have to be nuts to put on a uniform and go on a rampage on innocent people great job bucko
UpliftingNews,removed,if he has no relatives who is this forhes dead and all this did is make the people going feel like they did something good which they didnt
UpliftingNews,removed,lol
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah i spoke too soon i was thinking one of our recent mass killing events
UpliftingNews,removed,hmm well then its kinda weird people say this funeral is for the commemoration of insert deceased here
UpliftingNews,removed,wouldnt call this uplifting news
UpliftingNews,removed,what would be a remarkable demonstration of true patriotism would be if these people spent a few hours collectively leveraging their time and energy pressuring our lawmakers and policy setters to actually deliver healthcare to their returning veterans and sure stolen valor is a thing the problem is that i dont give enough of a shit about your opinion to post my
UpliftingNews,removed,but then again theres many but not enough people volunteering which is why i think its worthless that those people showed up to a funeral instead of showing up to the retirement home
UpliftingNews,removed,youre free to go on believing that showing your patriotism by showing up to a funeral for minutes instead of demanding better care for your veterans actually makes the world a better place ironically you have this freedom because of veterans as for welcome i challenge you to keep me out ban me and ill only roll a new account
UpliftingNews,removed,to bad people could not have shown up before she died when it would have mattered to her
UpliftingNews,removed,it was the veterans choice to join the war and no vets are heroes absolutely fuck every single vet and every single war tehyve ever fucking been inexcept maybe fuck the troops fuck the vets fuck the usa
UpliftingNews,removed,okay mr red white and blue what have you done for your country in your lifetime besides sit around on reddit shitting on veterans that is
UpliftingNews,removed,im kinda curious but why do people think this is a huge deal the person is dead they dont care whether someone shows up or people show up they have no opinion because theyre dead for me its the same as people blowing stupid amounts of money on funerals and coffins theyre dead they dont care
UpliftingNews,removed,people in the military are poor and stupid my two least favorite attributes
UpliftingNews,removed,you value male lives less than female lives
UpliftingNews,removed,like damn i came here to feel upliftednot to be teleported over to rpolitics
UpliftingNews,removed,am i the only one that thinks that this fucking makes no difference there should be people visiting her or at least some when she was alive not when she died it makes no fucking difference now
UpliftingNews,removed,bet that really meant a lot to him
UpliftingNews,removed,not like he cares
UpliftingNews,removed,it is a way for them to feel good about themselves so no not pointless definitely selfish
UpliftingNews,removed,this isnt an uplifting article this is sad and depressing here this college graduate went and served during for some time and by the end of her life she was homeless with no family and little to no friends the va cant even tell where she served and in what capacity so much for semper fidelis this nationsocietyva has let ms vine down in a big way
UpliftingNews,removed,doubt the dead guy cared that much
UpliftingNews,removed,why bother then funerals are for the living
UpliftingNews,removed,im actually really sorry to hear that that sucks i understand your anger i actually study marine biology so i would like to show you how sharks are actually an essential part of the marine food web but i dont think youd like to hear it as an aside i can assure you that fishing is already doing a great job of eradicating the fish we eat beyond the point of recovery and that would happen with or without sharks
UpliftingNews,removed,i was just thinking about how can this be hidden from china is that bad
UpliftingNews,removed,in other news the chinese have found a new hectare fishing spot
UpliftingNews,removed,people kill far and above more people than all alpha predators combined are you implying you think people should b extinct do you like food from the ocean stop advocating destroying the ecosystem them
UpliftingNews,removed,they just want to protect the area where they hid that plane
UpliftingNews,removed,thats racist charlie
UpliftingNews,removed,do you not know what a joke is
UpliftingNews,removed,nice blanket statement there bro
UpliftingNews,removed,are you really that dull or are you just being a dick it was clearly a joke cry about your downvotes some more
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre important to the ecosystem its that simple
UpliftingNews,removed,that was emotional you gave no reason and the explanation marks imply emotion also
UpliftingNews,removed,the arms of the baby come out first and grab onto the mothers source my ass
UpliftingNews,removed,httpeuoceanaorgenimportancesharks
UpliftingNews,removed,until they start sinking criminal fishing boats in large numbers i will just assume this is another donothing pr campaign just like with whale protection
UpliftingNews,removed,just a slight brown on the nose
UpliftingNews,removed,hes gonna be very popular with the boys in middle school
UpliftingNews,removed,rwarcrimes
UpliftingNews,removed,or alternatively a nice nudge towards suicide
UpliftingNews,removed,derp
UpliftingNews,removed,what a giant waste of money keep feeding money into individuals who will never be anything more than the current drain they are infuriates me
UpliftingNews,removed,grader is a brown noser
UpliftingNews,removed,as somebody who was once a grader i can confirm this kid will be bullied by his peers in a verbal manor
UpliftingNews,removed,wtf no dog is worth
UpliftingNews,removed,all female smart move would do the same if i had parents which could pay for the dinner
UpliftingNews,removed,what happened why does he need a dog couldnt find what conditionetc he has
UpliftingNews,removed,this guy fucks
UpliftingNews,removed,the look says ill never contribute to society throw em off the ledge like the spartans did
UpliftingNews,removed,this image looks like a really fucked up version of the bachelor
UpliftingNews,removed,he took of his last teachers looks like we know the molester of the bunch
UpliftingNews,removed,have you seen like this
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah george soros those indians get their oil via pipelines but are such special snowflakes they agitate against a deal legally approved by their leaders to provide oil to nonindians we should massacre all nonindians yeaahhh except for blacks and jews and muslims and mexicans and asians of course they need oil too
UpliftingNews,removed,not uplifting it only reminds me how stupid were all getting
UpliftingNews,removed,i would have aborted my child if i knew heshe had downs if my normalquotations because shouldnt have to be said child had a teacher with down syndrome i would petition so hard to get her removed from her position
UpliftingNews,removed,so easy a retard can do it
UpliftingNews,removed,what if she was given the degree out of pity
UpliftingNews,removed,i would be a lot more cautious at them becoming muslim fuck that
UpliftingNews,removed,do you own a cleaning company pretty sure anyone is qualified to be janitors
UpliftingNews,removed,am i didnt realize being concerned with my childs education makes me a bad person do you know who is a bad person down syndrome peoples parents for even bringing them into this world
UpliftingNews,removed,typical downer couldnt even get a bachelors
UpliftingNews,removed,great that she didnt let her disability keep her downs
UpliftingNews,removed,i mean yeah education is what degree stupid people get this is well known
UpliftingNews,removed,i mean she couldnt have picked any other major education is the major stupid people get because its so easy
UpliftingNews,removed,in their defense i dont think anyone wants to get taught by literal retard
UpliftingNews,removed,stop the presses i know reddit is all smiles and giggles or perverted but this comment said if your kid no i want my kid to have the best education they can possibly get im sorry but a person with downs is not exactly what id call normal they have a severe disability that impairs their brain function i know this is all about warm huggy feelings and being positive but seriously folks you really want your year having these crucial years of education being taught by somebody who has a severe mental disability of their brain function i know it makes me a jerk here on reddit but this stuff is just bologna im sure she is a great person kind etc im sure her degree was totally normal and not at all curved for her disability okie i mean you know college math to a downs person algebra seriously anyway im not knocking her or her dream im sure she is a fine person she is welcome to hang out all she wants with my children and even be an assistant but this comment said the teacher having downs nope
UpliftingNews,removed,when it comes to influencing children your rights dont matter shove your feelings up your ass
UpliftingNews,removed,if someone has downs syndrome but is still highly intelligent thats the biggest oxymoron in the history of oxymorons that tard cant teach thats just the breaks
UpliftingNews,removed,she wont be on her own you didnt read the article carefully the woman with downs has better reading comprehension than you
UpliftingNews,removed,what always bothered me about all of this is a question i always have how can somebody go into the teaching profession get there and realize they dont have what it takes and not do something to get themselves up to speed in todays world you can go out on the internet and learn all about pedagogy how lazy can you be about your profession especially one that impacts so many other people
UpliftingNews,removed,and if you really need a range offroad car very few people do just keep it the hell out of the centre of paris you mean like a taxi owner that wants a more efficient more reliable and less polluting diesel jetta or insert similar midsized car here yeah lets keep those peugeot out of paris

UpliftingNews,removed,yeah how dare him speak the truth when it offends your childish and whiny sensibilities it is literally a globalist propaganda hopeless team none of the athletes on the team will win any medals the team was created to help people like george soros can funnel refugees into countries in order to destroy them i know that in your world there is no such thing as politics that are too kind but you are ignorant and unaware so thats not very surprising
UpliftingNews,removed,to safety means an eu country where they can freely leech welfare of course these boats are intentionally sinking because they drill holes in them so they have to be picked up as rescues instead of the normal fair immigration method pathetic shitbags for humans abusing systems that are meant to help the weakest and people in true distress not people looking for an easier living
UpliftingNews,removed,how many of those were terrorists i am goign to try to find their names and keep a cross reference future terrorist attacks
UpliftingNews,removed,muh refugees much wow very uplifting

UpliftingNews,removed,yaay more muslims in my country ill have to pay taxes for truly a hero
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure it was just an oversight but you somehow neglected to capitalize the personal pronoun i or perhaps youre merely yet another narcissist that puts their personal convenience ahead of the conventions of writing conventions that make it easier for the ʀᴇᴀᴅᴇʀ if you think im just being a meanie i suggest you scroll through the comments and see how many follow your example youre publishing dude not texting someone close to you learn the fucking difference and that there is a difference
UpliftingNews,removed,uhh no what happened in the coup was the democratically elected government was upheld
UpliftingNews,removed,how about you let me determine that thanks
UpliftingNews,removed,not so safe for the people getting exposed to potential terrorists
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,europeans have raped the entire worlds cultures for hundreds of thousands of years so its only fair play that the rest of the world gets a chance now
UpliftingNews,removed,soyou cannot be blamed for the actions of white racists lynchingbut you are making a racial statement a bunch of people you dont even know how does that make sense i am exactly what is wrong with the world ftfy

UpliftingNews,removed,osman you have to go back to your country
UpliftingNews,removed,delta fell for the classic nigerian olympic soccer team stranded in atlanta scam
UpliftingNews,removed,thats nice of the airline but holy shit the team sounds like a bunch of morons
UpliftingNews,removed,delta thank for sendng us to rio please send a mooney order to pay for the airfaire after we receive the order we well send you more than the price of the tiket nigerian prince
UpliftingNews,removed,from the articls the problem according to the founder of united soccer africa was that the team had assumed it could simply buy plane tickets to rio at the last minute — just like nigerians do in their home country to book travel the associated press reported they then encountered a crush of travelers and lack of flights at the busy atlanta airport anyone else buying this biggest event in the world that week and busiest airport in the usa and the thirty of us will just walk on because you know the plane is surely going to be empty what in the actual fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,the nigerian prince strikes again
UpliftingNews,removed,unfortunately this isnt as feel good as youd think basically the sports ministry in nigeria is a disaster and hadnt paid the charter company they use so the charter company said nope not flying you to rio nice delta stepped up but its a mess of nigerias making
UpliftingNews,removed,id love to know how the ol nigerian prince talked his way into that one
UpliftingNews,removed,i heard they were trying to pay for their tickets with phony checks
UpliftingNews,removed,they talk a lot about them on
UpliftingNews,removed,how were the peanuts
UpliftingNews,removed,how were the peanuts
UpliftingNews,removed,how were the peanuts
UpliftingNews,removed,how were the peanuts
UpliftingNews,removed,dammit africa get your shit together or do you need some help with that
UpliftingNews,removed,how many were princes
UpliftingNews,removed,lol this new is hardly negative
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah im a bit cynical on this as well good publicity for delta to bolster their public image
UpliftingNews,removed,well when their prince is always giving people million how do they not expect to be broke as a country
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope none of them are muslims
UpliftingNews,removed,after giving that prince so much money youd think hed send his own damn football team to brazil
UpliftingNews,removed,wouldve been funny if a flight attendant stranded the entire team again by deplaning them because theyre muslim leaving the christian nigerians in
UpliftingNews,removed,this guy fucks
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope none of them participate in the swimming competitions theyd actually be better off crashing in the ocean at least theyd have a chance of surviving
UpliftingNews,removed,yall realize this happened because the nigerians thought they could just buy their fares off expedia a day before leaving some basic organization skills are needed these guys couldnt even put together a flea party on top of a rabid dog
UpliftingNews,removed,the only way this gets betterif delta can lose their luggage take that scammers
UpliftingNews,removed,httpimgurcomajkbxy
UpliftingNews,removed,delta does nothing for free delta will demand a pound of flesh from them
UpliftingNews,removed,was the team made up entirely of princes who needed help cashing an inheritance check
UpliftingNews,removed,did they kick the muslims off first
UpliftingNews,removed,good stay there
UpliftingNews,removed,they could take a boat like they did years ago
UpliftingNews,removed,how were the peanuts
UpliftingNews,removed,more gibs for the blacks yay
UpliftingNews,removed,why didnt the nigerian prince pay
UpliftingNews,removed,there is no bad publicityunless its nigeria
UpliftingNews,removed,oh suresome athletes need something lets bend over backwards and do everything we can to support them what about me when i was stranded go fuck yourself delta you only are doing this for good publicity this kind of preferential treatment reminds me of highschool so many athletes got privileges for what cause you can kick a ball go fuck yourselves too
UpliftingNews,removed,whole nigerian soccer organisation should be banned from the olympics cheaters
UpliftingNews,removed,so basically youtube youre okay with this site turning into fucking youtube im not
UpliftingNews,removed,i mean yay its good they made it but its not really worth celebrating the nigerian team are the ones at fault here should have planned ahead instead of waiting last minute like that other peoples stupidity should not constitute an emergency on someone elses end good on delta to go out of their way to accommodate them last minute but they should be so lucky to have that extra privilege bestowed on them
UpliftingNews,removed,the problem according to the founder of united soccer africa was that the team had assumed it could simply buy plane tickets to rio at the last minute — just like nigerians do in their home country to book travel so what this article is saying is the nigerian team is retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,nigeria is one of the richest countries in africa why the hell is delta not treating them like any other group is it because they are black is it because they think that black people arent capable of managing their own affairs fucking racist assholes
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile delta remove a muslim couple off a flight from france
UpliftingNews,removed,why is everyone there so cynical
UpliftingNews,removed,lol niggers
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder why the nigerian prince didnt help them out i mean he is millionaire
UpliftingNews,removed,so nigeria just scammed delta is that the story here
UpliftingNews,removed,they were going to compete at the olympics didnt bother to make sure they could get plane tickets in advance it never occurred to them that maybe a bunch of other people might also be flying to the olympics at that time
UpliftingNews,removed,this isnt uplifting corporations never do anything altruistic out of their own hearts this was a smart business move for altruistic publicity
UpliftingNews,removed,lol because thats all i said sorry i just dont need my hand held as i walk through a new city im a big boy and i tie my own shoes theres no problem having a great vacation mommy didnt hand you the itinerary for
UpliftingNews,removed,so badly mistreated what is this mistreatment of muslims that you are talking about give me one case
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting no this is pure marketing would they fly a grieving person for free if their parents lived abroad and they couldnt pay to go to fly to the funeral i doubt it im cynical but its true these companies are not charities they dont care about anybody they care about making money not losing it marketing is costly so when they can get it cheap they jump at it
UpliftingNews,removed,laws dont determine the morality of an action we all break laws at one time or another they dont but then you arent a law abiding citizen it means you only follow the laws you care about so i dont want to hear this whole law abiding citizen argument in fact a huge number of laws are immoral i disagree with them and if necessary will break them if i need to even if breaking that law jeopardizes the safety of our nation you think these guns that criminals get just magically appear out of no where theres a reason that essentially of crime guns in the us of crime guns in canada and by some measures the majority of crime guns in mexico all originate in the us its our weak laws and our gun culture high gun ownership rates i dont think the state should have the power to deny a person means of self defense
UpliftingNews,removed,white people sheeesh

UpliftingNews,removed,can you imagine how hard it is to waste your time going back for a degree when you dont need it uop paid him pretty well for all the commercials he has done for them over the years
UpliftingNews,removed,me providing you with factual evidence since when is telling me to do a google search an example of providing factual evidence please stop you sound silly
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont understand why you are getting down voted sure a degree from the university of phoenix isnt the best degree but larry doesnt even need a degree he is already a millionaire and set for life this is just another example of him being a great role model and all around good dude i dont know how anyone can hate on him
UpliftingNews,removed,he aka we should be doing this for all retards
UpliftingNews,removed,ah ok so he is a shill for them makes sense agree that employers do care

UpliftingNews,removed,great story and amazing generosity only thing i wonder because i live in ohio is that most people from detroit that are staying in ohio is because they are selling drugs such as heroin google it if you must but oh ky and wv is having a lot of drug problems and majority of those drugs are coming from detroit just wonder if this is his reason for being in the state

UpliftingNews,removed,a lot of cops die in car accidents and its more than likely because they are constantly speeding and driving reckless or drunk themselves i dont get why your feel good story about one cop has anything too do with the crazy incidences of police shooting unarmed people there are countless videos of police shooting peoples dogs or harassing people for just not completely kissing their ass if someone has a gun pointed at me i should comply with their wishes whether they be a cop or not what kind of pathetic servile mentality is that even if they told you to start sucking their dick id rather fucking just get shot and die im not gonna let corrupt cops get away with injustices just because there are a couple of good ones who do things any normal citizens can do to help the world who gives a shit if a cop is doing a nice little deed when the institution is corrupt are you gonna suddenly start supporting extremist religious bigotry just because they donate to charities and orphanages

UpliftingNews,removed,anyone else see the irony in this story he complains about his sister dying in a car accident caused by a young punk he who has no license proceeds to break the law speeding in essence being a young punk also the police officer didnt do his job whats his definition of a petty warrant

UpliftingNews,removed,the extremely rare good cop
UpliftingNews,removed,why be out and about when you know you have an outstanding warrant just go turn yourself in and get it over with you look better before the judge when turning yourself in anyway good story
UpliftingNews,removed,and then he shot him just kidding there are tooooooooooooooooooooons of amazing cops out there theyre people after all not robots
UpliftingNews,removed,what does that have to do with shootings i didnt even down vote you so sensitive
UpliftingNews,removed,white guilt
UpliftingNews,removed,but im white i can talk shit about white people
UpliftingNews,removed,so wait his sister died in a car crash so he goes out speeding
UpliftingNews,removed,what i hate about the man in this story is that his sister died in a car accident so he started speeding
UpliftingNews,removed,and then shot him times
UpliftingNews,removed,lol i was going in a on the way to the hospital because i got an emergency call from my brother about my dad having heart problems told the officer when he asked why i was speeding he said you shouldve been driving safer and then maybe you wouldnt be stuck here now still got the ticket too
UpliftingNews,removed,man whos sister may have been killed by tired driver persuades other guy to drive tiredand speed
UpliftingNews,removed,sister was killed in a car accident first reaction is to hop in a car and break the speed limit getting home
UpliftingNews,removed,well i know from reddit that all cops are scum so
UpliftingNews,removed,even when we help were still wrong lol the thread on the front page is a train wreck
UpliftingNews,removed,cops must draw straws to decide which one has to do something nice that day so that the world doesnt think theyre all bastards
UpliftingNews,removed,cop better take a selfie to commemorate this man shouldnt i wipe my tears first cop nah fam gotta reap dat karma
UpliftingNews,removed,wow an indiana state trooper that isnt a flaming bag of shit
UpliftingNews,removed,both have out standing warrants and were driving recklessly everyone knows how much i dislike cops probably because youre a piece of shit hoodrat
UpliftingNews,removed,plot twist his family are in prison
UpliftingNews,removed,however touching this is you have to admit theres some irony here sister gets killed by dumb punk in car accident and immediately after youre speeding yourself possibly risking others lives
UpliftingNews,removed,before or after he shot the black guy
UpliftingNews,removed,all white peoples iz fuckin devils man
UpliftingNews,removed,this is sweet and all i have heard of cops giving a ride for school kids that are late and doesnt seem to be cutting class but is it okay for a police officer on duty to drive miles to help with non emergency o
UpliftingNews,removed,im confused so when did the cop shoot him
UpliftingNews,removed,so he drives him to his family and then he hits him with the stun gun
UpliftingNews,removed,i shared this on facebook and some asshat said i was racist wtf
UpliftingNews,removed,your story sucks
UpliftingNews,removed,fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda fake propaganda
UpliftingNews,removed,rats
UpliftingNews,removed,but is it kindness or a result of the times does that make it less genuine questions that should be asked as simply being uplifted without purpose is inane
UpliftingNews,removed,and then he shot him after the funeral
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting indeed why have i never heard about this girl before still cant help but think illi be seeing her obituary on rnottheonion when she dies of an overload of staph e coli or hepatitis though
UpliftingNews,removed,everyone calm down look at his post history hes infertile
UpliftingNews,removed,let me catch some fucks first
UpliftingNews,removed,im a german and im fucking sick from refugees especially that like are men are they to coward to defend there kids women and elderly
UpliftingNews,removed,american health care is shitif you mention that here though you will automatically be a socialist
UpliftingNews,removed,she should be executed for aiding a foreign invasion fucking bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,survived syria just to die in the shit infested waters of brazil how sad
UpliftingNews,removed,but for real why is usa healthcare so bad i thought that state should care about their citizen
UpliftingNews,removed,nineyear old raises dollars working at a sweatshop to feed his five brothers
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah i would totally refuge her any time
UpliftingNews,removed,common redditors we can help only left to go
UpliftingNews,removed,its true and can confirm some things are alittle unnecessary and tacked on or even excluded devoid its sad that its in this state i give credit to the kid though hes got hope
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,ive heard that there is no war in turkey to escape from as a syrian or have i missed something when did being a refugee give anyone the right to pick a country in the world and live there while everyone else has to undergo strenous visa applications or capability tests being a refugee isnt a free for all but finding safty somewhere you arent killed im sorry if this offends you but that is actually how international law was written
UpliftingNews,removed,he probably just wanted to help and his parents wanted him to feel like he contributed to make him feel good about himself
UpliftingNews,removed,i thought that too
UpliftingNews,removed,not to mention his is a moot point its not going to mean jack shit in the final total bill
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre not raising money for the procedure they are raising money to get to the place they are having the procedure a place thats miles away the part i am trying to figure out is why they need to go to houston and cant go somewhere closer there are several major cities that are closer than houston
UpliftingNews,removed,upliftinger some countries dont make their children raise money to pay for heart surgeries
UpliftingNews,removed,good job billy with all the money you raised we were able to walk into the er and buy three whole bandaids
UpliftingNews,removed,jesus christ a nine year old has to resort to a lemonade stand to get some help for a sick family member what in the everloving fuck is wrong with this country
UpliftingNews,removed,serious question i know health care is expensive in the states but i was also led to believe that if you had health insurance it was alright or is it still expensive regardless
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah unfortunately pays for like regular strength ibuprofen in a hospital its disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,read the article the money was for getting the family to houston
UpliftingNews,removed,itt murica sucks circlejerk
UpliftingNews,removed,people just need to work harder and not expect the system to take care of them when i was given a medical bill i just worked harder and ended up fine my boss actually payed me more when he saw me tightening my boot straps and working harder s
UpliftingNews,removed,nice effort but isnt this another great example of why we need single payer coverage i wonder if littler girls in canada and germany have to hustle lemonade would be nice to read years old plays with little brother as kids should do
UpliftingNews,removed,something doesnt add up here surely insurance should cover a significant surgery such as this either they are poorly covered or they dont have insurance at all even medicaid would cover this case
UpliftingNews,removed,american right we should be threatening everyone with jail or death unless they hand over money so government can squander it on dollar hammers
UpliftingNews,removed,i find it sad and depressing that the most powerful nation in the world makes their people do this to pay for healthcare
UpliftingNews,removed,how to know you live in a third world country when your country devolves responsibility for saving a childs savable life to his brothers unlicenced roadside juice stand
UpliftingNews,removed,only in americaand third world hell holes
UpliftingNews,removed,til hitler was also a child molester
UpliftingNews,removed,thats adorable and all but in any other first world nation this wouldnt happen because taxes cover healthcare this is not uplifting this is tragic
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder if the gov will come after them for their taxes
UpliftingNews,removed,this isnt uplifting its depressing what sort of world healthcare would force a little girl into having to resort to doing this i cant for the life of me understand how healthcare isnt covered as part of your taxes
UpliftingNews,removed,you know whats more disgusting is that a cop can shut her establishment down because she doesnt have permits happens all the time
UpliftingNews,removed,sanders for president wait what
UpliftingNews,removed,the hospitals dont charge
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel the same way this isnt uplifting its depressing
UpliftingNews,removed,wealthy is just an opinion most wealthy nations are trillions in debt the bubble will burst at some point just look at greece
UpliftingNews,removed,im going to say both the nhs has a great deal of knowledge about trauma and limb replacements due to the troubles canada likewise because of affordability and france due to well french things
UpliftingNews,removed,its a shame that in the united states land of the free a year old selling lemonade to help pay for brothers heart surgery is illegal without a license also the us doesnt have wealth and recourses its people do
UpliftingNews,removed,for fuck sake just get free healthcare already something is seriously wrong with the priorities in the us open your eyes
UpliftingNews,removed,the fucked up part is that dollars is a shitload of money to a year old and wont cover much of the cost at all
UpliftingNews,removed,shouldnt howabout we recognize that our progress in the last years may not have included this but soon might lets keep it going lets encourage cool utopian things and lets chill on the negativity
UpliftingNews,removed,murica health system
UpliftingNews,removed,id say the uplifting part is that no cops came to bully her and shut down the stand
UpliftingNews,removed,i am happy to live in europ than there are jusy simple rules for this and you dont need your brother to raise money
UpliftingNews,removed,its not for the procedure though its for travel expenses for her grandmother to get to houston for her brothers heart surgery
UpliftingNews,removed,i love reddit the article is literally about an owl whisperer and is the head of a bird sanctuary
UpliftingNews,removed,its a shame you didnt read the article and felt the need to shitpost because of it
UpliftingNews,removed,health care shouldnt be free its not my job to pay for someones health here come the down votes
UpliftingNews,removed,itt a lot of shitty people who didnt read the article but decided it was best to bring rpolitics to this sub for no good reason
UpliftingNews,removed,did they eliminate the mother or the child
UpliftingNews,removed,hospitals write off millions of dollars of dollars each year that patients owe but cant pay so nobody pays the full amount that originally shows up on a bill
UpliftingNews,removed,are they fixing broken arms
UpliftingNews,removed,yea sure lets just bring a bunch of deformed people into the world to suffer for a lifetime if they live that long but hey at least noone will get their feefees hurt or feel left out
UpliftingNews,removed,no fuck you
UpliftingNews,removed,if big pharma sold medicine that cured diseases then how can they make money off years of continuous treatment their best interest is their stakeholders not their customers
UpliftingNews,removed,i was going to point out that the us almost certainly has stricter guidelines for getting medicines approved then thailand generally for good reason but after looking the information ive found indicates that httpsenwikipediaorgwikihivandpregnancyindicationstostartmedications reading the article again it is careful to say first country in the asiapacific region there are definitely things to complain about in regards to medicine but this doesnt seem to be one of them
UpliftingNews,removed,but dont people go to thailand all the time for the hookers anyways
UpliftingNews,removed,wow good job thailand taking a drug other people made years ago paying for it with other peoples money and making a tiny dent in your homegrown problem keep up the great work
UpliftingNews,removed,loser
UpliftingNews,removed,i disagree with this if the nasty slut mother has aids oh well you should not have been a dity cunt so i hope this does not catch on
UpliftingNews,removed,absolutely not cancer is a very serious thing but i think if a woman is having sex but she aggrees to it and gets aids thats is her fault so i hope the baby wont have aids
UpliftingNews,removed,dad of the year more like annoying asshole of the year
UpliftingNews,removed,i like to read on a plane or chat with my loved ones to take my mind off things i dont like to sleep or listen to music on a flight i also dont want to talk to strangers and i dont like kids its manipulative what do you say or do sure you can say no thanks or alter your behavior to appear busy and not be bothered but if you try to opt out of that somehow of course everyone would act like youre the asshole anyone here saying they wouldnt like to partake in that is being attacked imagine if they were on that flight and told the dad sorry i just want to sit here and not talk to your child or you i want to talk to my fiancé and read my book
UpliftingNews,removed,lol im just here like i speak english et le français viens sur mon niveau pute
UpliftingNews,removed,this is news
UpliftingNews,removed,mic dropping suave president if if if if if if if if okie doke

UpliftingNews,removed,yea i feel like im at a frat party its im slowly passing out on the couch fairly certain ive been roofied and now im just wondering which one of these assholes is going to sexually assault me whos idea was it to come to this party anyway
UpliftingNews,removed,all we can do now is just pray for an assassination
UpliftingNews,removed,being a financial planner means giving financial advice to people and its never an easy job if you happen to be one of those people who arent ready to take all the risks and responsibilities that this job carries with it you should consider some other options
UpliftingNews,removed,although i am not a republican george w bush if he votes for hillary will gain my respect and likability percent the gop has let a bunch of imbeciles take over their party sounds like george is still able to think for himself unlike trump supporters who are worse than trump
UpliftingNews,removed,i think scalping is illegal in chicagoso she might have been saying that just because she didnt want to admit to trying to procure a ticket illegally
UpliftingNews,removed,nope
UpliftingNews,removed,but its full of slums and wild dogs and people who shit in the streets its not like most peoples preconceived notions are that far off
UpliftingNews,removed,cool can they pickup theyre trash now
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry pajeet but india is still slumdog millionaire a large portion of the country mexico has the largest gdp which sounds nice but that doesnt describe the poverty and drug wars its suffering from
UpliftingNews,removed,the news is uplifting the comments here not so much
UpliftingNews,removed,by what metric are you basing that off of because by india is still well below the us china and the eu if were talking about nitrogen pollution id wager most western countries are the worst offenders there heavy metals again countries with long established industries you might have a leg to stand on calling india a major polluter when concerning ocean plastic but they are responsible for less overall pollution than western countries
UpliftingNews,removed,poo
UpliftingNews,removed,now if they could stop shitting outside theyd be going places
UpliftingNews,removed,i didnt even know hippopotamuss had drivers seats
UpliftingNews,removed,well india is also the only country to have an active thorium reactor project
UpliftingNews,removed,since the economic power electric grid and military might of a country are all pretty closely linked i dont see why not
UpliftingNews,removed,has there been any progress on how to effectively store that energy overnight for morning use last i checked was years ago and here in the us we were still having trouble finding good cost effective energy storage elements
UpliftingNews,removed,just like the movie sunshine
UpliftingNews,removed,i am belittling people who have bought into the rightwings decades of propaganda against a good person you sound like a moron your vote might as well have been the fart it smells like
UpliftingNews,removed,class act i love stories like this

UpliftingNews,removed,prince the closet junkie
UpliftingNews,removed,ol billy blue apron
UpliftingNews,removed,what you call marriage equality i call tyranny of the minority
UpliftingNews,removed,shit i wasnt even aware of this i voted trump and would have tossed in thats more than a lot of lefties would have im sure
UpliftingNews,removed,its sad that a sports team means this much give it a few years all these players will bounce for lucrative contracts elsewhere and forget they were ever on the cubs
UpliftingNews,removed,my dad and i bonded over the raiders he passed away when i was love the team and watch them every weekend but im also realistic he ded worm food
UpliftingNews,removed,downvoted cause gay
UpliftingNews,removed,i know this is uplifting news and all but i really dont think the dead guy cares
UpliftingNews,removed,to busy grabbing pussy to proofread
UpliftingNews,removed,so obama found a clone and time machine to save the future cheeky
UpliftingNews,removed,well weve seen how reddit reacts when white guys get elected
UpliftingNews,removed,hes black man where you been for the past years black people in this nation are fuckin oppressed they dont get elected president reelected president attorney general attorney general congressional appointments senatorial positions wardensdo i need to go on the fact that a black man got elected to a shit ass district by people who loved his fucking mix tape is hopelessly lost on you how dare you sir how dare you
UpliftingNews,removed,who in their right mind would vote for a black women
UpliftingNews,removed,liberals are super depressed right meow so anything like this is uplifting news but i find it hilarious that michigan is totally capable of electing a young black man yet at the same time they are apparently racist white males who are too sexist to elect a woman
UpliftingNews,removed,black college student jewell jones makes history as youngest lawmaker in michigan ben wyatt wasnt a lawmaker in michigan dude
UpliftingNews,removed,sell your principles to the highest bidder
UpliftingNews,removed,im in your district as well im pretty pissed she was elected most people i talked to only voted for her because she is a right wing evangelical for gun rights i dont want guns to be banned either but wtf the woman voted yes for fracking wants to ban gay marriage etc shes a liberty u grad google it and was elected in at after being homeschooled her whole life its not like she had some relevant degree for the job how does someone get elected with no life experience i think the minimum age of is a better idea you should have a couple years of work experience under your belt in the real world so you can relate to the people youre representing apparently she was living with her parents when she was elected it sounds like shes lived in an echo chamber her whole life
UpliftingNews,removed,haha every white person deserves to die for tolerance
UpliftingNews,removed,blacks are known as violent apes they need to show this to the blm to see they can change
UpliftingNews,removed,just what we need more fucking niggers
UpliftingNews,removed,piont to one specific person that is being oppressed all youve done is tried to make yourself feel superior by insulting me and acting like im unaware of some information youre a parrot and have likely been made to feel guilty for existing its a shame and i would pity you if you werent such a little smug shit
UpliftingNews,removed,troll harder
UpliftingNews,removed,downvote me
UpliftingNews,removed,you cant prove something doesnt exist go stick your finger in a dyke
UpliftingNews,removed,he said walnut passed away this morning at the family and our three whippets monty nelson and charlie were also in the room i understand the sentiment but lets be honest the dog didnt pass away a veterinarian euthanized him
UpliftingNews,removed,totally this is why i think hitler gets too much shit
UpliftingNews,removed,she did not know what the meds were doing
UpliftingNews,removed,you say something is possible then use that possibility to state what you call a fact im stating that no one could know whether the dog knew the effects of the drugs or not and therefore cannot say that with certainty it probably feels good to pretend that you know what goes on in the mind of an animal but you cant back it up with anything more than your opinion which is dog shit pun intended
UpliftingNews,removed,whats your neighbors phone numbers or address
UpliftingNews,removed,in china they eat the dogs while theyre still alive
UpliftingNews,removed,i disagree ive eaten pets before chickens cows i think people get too emotional miss woofles get another same with friends hobbies kids get another parents get a pass but im sure you can find a surrogate if you really try not to suggest apathy not at all but if anything should supposit nihilism its that contrary to what you think the sun rises tommorrow even sans whiskers
UpliftingNews,removed,oppression doesnt exist how would you know have you ever been oppressed stfu white boy
UpliftingNews,removed,shut the fuck up
UpliftingNews,removed,im a race realist you sound like a race apologist you cuck i do have many stories i can relate about witnessing numerous blacks attacking single whites in a jump scenario but i have never seen a bunch of whites attack a lone black and i live in a major city
UpliftingNews,removed,your neighbours were right your best friend was in agonizing pain and you didnt put him out of his misery in time instead he had to die a painful protracted death because his owner couldnt do the right thing
UpliftingNews,removed,youre only making us feel worse you ass
UpliftingNews,removed,if putin wont respect a nofly zone in allepo and hillary said shed implement a nofly zone and shoot down any russian air craft the only thing thatll catchon after election day will be the atmosphere after nuclear blasts level cities
UpliftingNews,removed,how the actual fuck is a person getting killed uplifting news yay lets celebrate the warmongering and maintaining the dominant narrative i joined this sub for some actual uplifting news occasionally as the rest of it is just bs doom and gloom
UpliftingNews,removed,just a thought but maybe people are no longer nice because they are tired of getting the shaft by the ruling elite
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe they should read make america kind for once there really isnt a time in our history when we were kind to one another just my ¢
UpliftingNews,removed,when has america ever been kind slavery racism illegal and nonsensical wars extremely corrupt political system very fucked up legal systemwhat america do you two live in again
UpliftingNews,removed,seriously in the history of the world when was usa ever kind their entire basis of existence is stealing land and oil from people
UpliftingNews,removed,am i the only person who thinks politicians being as rude and aggressive as they want is better for the process than everyone being polite and buttonlipped about what they really think uptight people like that make me ill and i dont associate with them
UpliftingNews,removed,the salt after this election will be strong no matter who wins best thing that can happen is the winner is impeached no matter who it is
UpliftingNews,removed,am i supposed to clap or something
UpliftingNews,removed,shes not the first woman on the frontline a woman is a biological female human she isnt she was a biological male in the army who then decided to become female while still in the army its not an accomplishment many people choose to change their gender its not an accomplishment because the person transitioning has a certain job
UpliftingNews,removed,how the fuck is this uplifting op you fucking fail go back to goddamn tumblr and take your garbage with you no one here gives a shit
UpliftingNews,removed,thats a man
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck the police though right i really dont understand all the people that hate the police and classify all of them as evil its quite insulting to those who want to make a difference in the community
UpliftingNews,removed,it is interesting that they would post this right after a year old was shot by police in columbus earlier this week
UpliftingNews,removed,imagine this but with the guy who saved hitler
UpliftingNews,removed,it is but i never said that all police are good cause there are obviously evil ones that abuse their power im talking about the people that see a police officer and immediately shows dislike for them because they think back to the evil ones and generalize that to every police officer
UpliftingNews,removed,did he shoot him
UpliftingNews,removed,no its not im preeeetty sure that a majority of policemen arent scumbags that most really do care about their jobs and helping others its just the bad ones that get most of the attention as is usual its nice to see some news about a good cop for once anyhow
UpliftingNews,removed,they never claimed all officers were good and even if they did it would be closer to the truth than all saying all of them are bad most officers are good people but in any sample of over million humans youre gonna have some bad seeds
UpliftingNews,removed,middle class working people how do you feel about pulling over the working poor
UpliftingNews,removed,spoiler then sloots him
UpliftingNews,removed,its times like this im reminded that police officers truly can do no wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,most of them are probably dead
UpliftingNews,removed,it looks like the officer is regretting it did the guy turn out to be a dick
UpliftingNews,removed,did they fuck afterwards would totally buy that sex tape
UpliftingNews,removed,til in a police officer managed to avoid fucking up and killing a black kid
UpliftingNews,removed,this was taken seconds before the police officer fired warning shots into his back
UpliftingNews,removed,mate i forgot to reenable my adblocker disabled to support youtubers and holy shit i forgot how bad the internet is without adblock shit popped right in my face covering the whole page
UpliftingNews,removed,great story good thing the kid wasnt on the ground with his hands behind his back because the cop would have shot him
UpliftingNews,removed,the city of columbus was wise to make sure this made the paper this week year old saved by cop however long ago certainly is better to see than year old killed by cop days ago good to hear regardless just an observation
UpliftingNews,removed,then he shot him cause hes black
UpliftingNews,removed,call me racist but i thought that was a screenshot of key and peele
UpliftingNews,removed,so basically still a man but with a womans mentality
UpliftingNews,removed,every exposure forests a blast
UpliftingNews,removed,that website gave my phone horrendous cancer
UpliftingNews,removed,thats a man who feels like a girl performing the job males have commonly filled for generations by men that may or may have not felt like women but it wasnt socially acceptable to talk about it amongst men or women so not news
UpliftingNews,removed,the police officer was later fired for not shooting the man in the head s
UpliftingNews,removed,down vote this
UpliftingNews,removed,but its a man not a woman i dont get this story if i decide that i identify as a porcupine and am a pilot will there be news stories about the first ever porcupine pilot
UpliftingNews,removed,large lot of selection cheap prices
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder how many kids will get jobs in the future because their mom got offended and complained publically the philosophy of i or my child dont deserve to be treated any differently than anyone else so give me or my child special recognition for being different is perpelexing to me
UpliftingNews,removed,genetic defects are beautiful now
UpliftingNews,removed,pure cancer if you ask me hurr durr evceryobne needs attention my downie son is just as good looking as yours go neck yourself dumb bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,im getting tired of this shit hire a potato baby to model your brand and they will focus on the model and not the brand this entitled country is bullying their way into fulfilling their little feelgood needs also imagine the difficulties working with someone who is mentally and emotionally challenged
UpliftingNews,removed,his mother should be put in jail for stupidity he should not be a child model either
UpliftingNews,removed,its not uplifting that another bully got their way by making a big enough stink this would have been truly uplifting if instead of bitching on the internet to all the sjws that her special baby didnt get a modeling career due to a genetic birth defect that makes them unattractive she had tried other agencies or even petitioned for her child to be the poster child to some sort of down syndrome agency that promotes the well being of the children with this defect instead some mother got her way and is now pimping out her mentally challenged child into a mentally trying field this is uplifting to you you have serious mental problem of your own if it is
UpliftingNews,removed,how is being realistic toxic to you again you are only promoting this bullshit special snowflake business
UpliftingNews,removed,looking through this comment section i am no longer so uplifted
UpliftingNews,removed,after nasa snubed adorable astronauts because they her down syndrome people around the world reacted and now he has as job bagging groceries at ralphs
UpliftingNews,removed,oshkosh bgosh is a retarded name anyways
UpliftingNews,removed,yeps model agencies reject of kids most are just too ugly dont look perfect enough for the job models are people others aspire to become people others would like to be or have as kids but ugly people cant complain via the press these parents abuse the handicap
UpliftingNews,removed,people who have a child with downs syndrome have by default shown themselves to be self absorbed pieces of shit this is just more of the same
UpliftingNews,removed,thats fucking disgusting getting a job because you have a disability and you have a fucking crying crybaby piece of shit of for parent i want to throw up i dont belong here this isnt real
UpliftingNews,removed,he only got a job because people reacted and this was an opportunity for oshkosh to get good marketing and look like the good guys this probably would never have happened otherwise
UpliftingNews,removed,yay for public shaming sarcasm why cant people just be told no anymore without having to run to the internet screaming bloody murder and whoa is me im sory your child has this horrible disease but he cant be a steel worker either you gonna cry about that to the world also
UpliftingNews,removed,can we all just be real for a second and admit that downs babies look weird
UpliftingNews,removed,he works for a klingon modelling agency
UpliftingNews,removed,mommy stomped her feet and cryed discrimination until a company saw a opportunity to look like they care about her cause for the publicity
UpliftingNews,removed,his mom is a bitch for trying to whore out her son no your baby doesnt want to be a star thats not his dream thats yours you selfish bitch your kid just wants to be a kid ugh some ass holes should not have children
UpliftingNews,removed,that is one ugly baby what makes his parents think hes model material when hes clearly not and never will be attractive
UpliftingNews,removed,the victimhood minus reality is so strong with this one its sickening
UpliftingNews,removed,girl get a fucking manikin and let babies be babies fuck all you bad narcissistic parents your kid doesnt wanna work they wanna be kids
UpliftingNews,removed,lol listen to yourself your actually advocating baby labor are you fucking kidding
UpliftingNews,removed,wow he made a statement on an annonymous internet forum this guy is a regular hero
UpliftingNews,removed,no one wants to be the kid with down syndrome i fucking laughed
UpliftingNews,removed,the kid has downs and is a model great so why is he entitled to a modeling job because of his downs can i be entitled to a modeling job bc im irish or that i have freckles this is so dumb he may be a shit model and the internet freaked out bc has downs and the world told him no
UpliftingNews,removed,im not sure you quite realize how arrogant this sounds this fellow works in this specific industry you just came along and told him that he and all his colleagues are doing it wrong given that there are big bucks at stake do you really think these people dont do controlled research on what works and what doesnt i understand that many people like to sound nice and caring by saying positive things about the disabled but when that urge to signal virtue translates into giving people bad advice then those who take it can be hurt worse yet those who are intelligent or knowledgeable enough to avoid taking become vulnerable to public character assassination like this modelling agency for example perhaps we can make a deal if those who like to virtue signal would agree to refrain from messing up working processes by doing so and to just shout i am a good person instead then i and others like me would agree to support that claim before we get back to the business of getting stuff done
UpliftingNews,removed,fucking potatoes will never buy tard brand clothing
UpliftingNews,removed,ummm yeah so no one wants a kid with ds there will never be a situation where someone will look at a kid with ds and say i want that acceptance is one thing but to try to sell a product based on the desires of parents and having a defective kid for the poster child doesnt really fit the bill id also like to nip it in the bud a kid with ds is defective sure the are high functioning kids that might one day leave their parents care for the care of someone who only has to check up on them once a month but that is not the human standard and if it were we would cease to exist
UpliftingNews,removed,hooray for social media outrage culture how uplifting that we can force people to do things against their will by forming a mob
UpliftingNews,removed,and then theres people like you who romanticize mental illness ive worked with families who have disabled children and their lives are hell campaigns like these treat ds kids like a cute puppy when the reality is that a family that chooses to keep a ds child have resigned themselves to caretaking until the day they die they get no vacations and no retirement the reason people on this sub are so against disabled children is because theyve heard stories from people like me people whove actually had to work with families of disabled children and have seen firsthand what having a disabled child does to a persons life
UpliftingNews,removed,i think the mom may just be jealous of that cute ds kid in the target ads
UpliftingNews,removed,downies are gross
UpliftingNews,removed,im sorry you feel so hurt by people who like to virtue signal it sounds like these are issues in your own life though and not something i could help you with you purposefully give others advice that will harm them in order to boost your own standing and then try to insult them when they call you out on it i dont think you understand how transparent this image of kindness and empathy youre trying to project is to others youre blatantly a sociopath
UpliftingNews,removed,alright his kids still fucking ugly though youre kidding yourself calling it adorable
UpliftingNews,removed,id have paid for her abortion
UpliftingNews,removed,you require an apology check your privilege youre literally demanding me to do something against my will this is rape
UpliftingNews,removed,much like every parent acting otherwise is dishonest
UpliftingNews,removed,get off your high horse ravvan he is right
UpliftingNews,removed,the kid looks fucking retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,was it really because the child has down syndrome or because the child has the facial features which denote severe fetal alcohol syndrome perhaps they didnt want to have a child who is the victim of his own mothers alcohol abuse as their marketing campaign its pretty sad do you want your product to make people think about alcohol abuse and all of the child victims who will have to live with their parents bad choices for his whole life this wont make me buy a product it will just make me sad for a few minutes
UpliftingNews,removed,but what about retard strength thats a real thing
UpliftingNews,removed,what is wrong with you genetic testing for down syndrome is done via a blood test of the mother no one does amniocentesis unless the blood test is inconclusive for some reason
UpliftingNews,removed,flip story medical staff at childrens hospital using sick children to level their pokemon go character has gaming gone to far
UpliftingNews,removed,that must suck to be the kid that cant get out of bed watching all the other sick kids running around catching them pokeymen

UpliftingNews,removed,childrens hospital down the street from me is requesting they be removed due to the game attracting unwanted visitors im leaning more towards the massive slump on productivity theyve seen

UpliftingNews,removed,how does your mom get out of the house
UpliftingNews,removed,why does the thumbnail look like someone shoving a long stick up an elephants ass like some interspecies dominatrix porn
UpliftingNews,removed,scrolling through the comments i am disappointed by the lack of jokes about ops mom
UpliftingNews,removed,not mentioned the elephants were also into sm according to thumbnail im glad to see elesadists finally have a safe place to share their fetish

UpliftingNews,removed,came here to congratulate ops mom and her friends
UpliftingNews,removed,not yet but were working on it
UpliftingNews,removed,i take it back maybe you are delusional keep parroting that programming kiddo
UpliftingNews,removed,you think shes fuckin that kid
UpliftingNews,removed,you sure thats a lady racism only exists because governments like to force different races to live on the same land
UpliftingNews,removed,we are one race black lives matter hey all lives matter no black lives matter you racist
UpliftingNews,removed,its not just the pigment of the skin brain volume is different skeletal structure is different
UpliftingNews,removed,its not bigotry to point out that someone doesnt understand basic facts theyre simply mad that their ignorance has been pointed out so they fight it with claiming that the other side is actually worse because they wont just accept that trumpers have no grasp on reality they actually think its bigotry because we wont listen to them and simply accept their ignorance
UpliftingNews,removed,ah yes the classic im not an x youre an x elementary school technique sorry buddy but when you fucking vote for a god damn bigot you have to prove that you arent one dont try to fucking turn it around like youre all the sudden tolerant after years of blaming literally everything you could on democrats and refusing to listen to facts or reason because you didnt like that a black man was president
UpliftingNews,removed,well statistically speaking yes this is the same excuse as it is racism when you call me racist no this is altright logic that we have to against fight daily in some twisted up logic the fact that denouncing racism is seen as an attack against fairbalanced where all viewpoints must be viewed as equal but it isnt bigotry is morally wrong racism is morally wrong and thus they are not valid viewpoints saying that trump supporters are bigot does not make the one saying that a bigot it makes him a douche and a liar but if we say that there is stronger correlation on bigotry and votingnot voting for trump we are not lying anymore nor are we accusing all of them just stating a fact much larger portion of trump votera re bigots and racist that hillary or those who voted for any major third party candidate those are the facts you may not like them but you have no counter argument either that proves me wrong right
UpliftingNews,removed,someone got stuffed
UpliftingNews,removed,it was perfect because she wanted the dark meat

UpliftingNews,removed,part of me wants this to be a lighthearted story that shows how nice people are what i really think is since this went viral they got together and said we can get on tv and get some money if you really come over
UpliftingNews,removed,yooo he actually did it
UpliftingNews,removed,why did it have to be a nigger
UpliftingNews,removed,that is a awful headline took me too long to understand there should be a comma after text or a period
UpliftingNews,removed,the person she originally meant to contact is still such a mystery to me
UpliftingNews,removed,so what who fukin cares why is this even news worth mentioning all news these days are so irrelevant why would we need to know this shit
UpliftingNews,removed,itll be uplifting at first but then stuff starts going missing
UpliftingNews,removed,so she had dark meat and light meat for thanksgiving
UpliftingNews,removed,you make it sound like the tensions are about the election process in general and not the white supremacist as chief advisor or the nazis celebrating the outcome
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe he went to multiple dinners 😮

UpliftingNews,removed,brazzers
UpliftingNews,removed,this is like the longest story for a interracial porno
UpliftingNews,removed,am the only one who thinks this is weird

UpliftingNews,removed,nearly everything that is posted to this sub is depressing in its own way how is the fact that someone had to pay to protect wilderness uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,too bad trump is going to grab her by the pussy and murder her right thats what the media left wants me to believe right right
UpliftingNews,removed,until some swine decides we need to build a pipeline through it and theres absolutely fuck all you can do aboutthe treaty ahhhhh that old thing

UpliftingNews,removed,how about you dont fucking put words in my mouth i literally meant referring to her as african is identity politics idgaf what trump said hes probably right ive had it with every non white country not going out of their way for white people but whites have to go out of their way for non whites multiculturalism really is only practised where white people are

UpliftingNews,removed,the title implied it and the title is bullshit there are plenty of countries on the continent of africa who have launched satellites other posters have mentioned south africa but its not alone here or did you think al jazeera was broadcast using tin cans and string
UpliftingNews,removed,god wants her to rip xd
UpliftingNews,removed,pointing out that the article has a misleading and also incorrect title is not being a dick it is saving the other readers of this post from thinking this information is in any way true also read rule because that has anything to do with his comment s
UpliftingNews,removed,i had no idea dirt aids and violence could propel a continent to space
UpliftingNews,removed,its pretty simple you asked if it matters if the launch doesnt take place from africa and the answer is yes it does couldnt care less about what you see or dont see also he actually said he was not notpicking
UpliftingNews,removed,theres probably a line for this sort of thing the ultimate feel good charity go read to mean smelly old blind nursing home patients then ill give you a nod
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah but if the baby is retarded then the suffering is extended eternally and leaves a mark in society whether we consciously notice it or not it will ruin many peoples days for years to come the kid is still a baby so im not sure this was really a good thing to survive even if the child is safe stigma and delusional assumptions aided by confirmation bias of the parents or peers will drown the child in selfanalysis and selfrejection nothing seems good
UpliftingNews,removed,instead of reading to homeless kidswhy dont you feed them instead some people in this world are stupid as fucksmh 😒

UpliftingNews,removed,how the fuck is this uplifting news if he wins and tries that nonsense hell fail
UpliftingNews,removed,those unsung mom and pop places werent a subject of a lbgtq rights boycott so the story of their donation isnt as compelling no less noble just less notable you are punishing cfa for goodwill because of media coverage that you have no facts that they coordinated i guess it would have been better if cfa didnt support those giving blood to help the victims of this tragedy those greedy sobs how dare they show any compassion or support sjw unite
UpliftingNews,removed,that doesnt change the fact that their largest victim is still muslims the question isnt whether or not they believe theyre muslims that theyre killing intentionsreasonings do not change their actions
UpliftingNews,removed,lmao acts of violence done under the guise of christianity over the past years cant even begin the touch the numbers of murders done by islamic extremist
UpliftingNews,removed,im going to find a kidney wanted list it ought to be worth at least months of guiltsex

UpliftingNews,removed,someone rich is paying him that money
UpliftingNews,removed,how
UpliftingNews,removed,and your reasoning is surely it is incredibly naive to think that tens of thousands of years of evolution in vastly differing climates and environments results in no differences among races lol according to this fellow we are all the same one race the human race eh ive bet youve said that unironically at one point in your life face it at the end of the day we are the product of evolution and nature humans were forced to migrate and subsequently adapt and change new environments result in new species
UpliftingNews,removed,mexico is in central america no it isnt retard
UpliftingNews,removed,yea thanks for proving my point africa and the middle east is less evolved and less civilized than our european counterparts the british to be specific are the most superior they understood long ago what was stupid while africans still chop up whitey today they created the best countries best it was the best empire
UpliftingNews,removed,persecution
UpliftingNews,removed,lol do some research before you call me ignorant you fucking uninformed hippy both sides have broken the law but if you claim the protesters are innocent then you my friend live a sheltered life now get back to making starbucks drinks
UpliftingNews,removed,wow the same people on upliftingnews attacking people for language skills why am i not surprised from a ideologue cult
UpliftingNews,removed,these comments make me want to filter this subreddit
UpliftingNews,removed,its russias fault dont forget to vote early
UpliftingNews,removed,dont mention those theyre from russia they dont count ignore them vote early
UpliftingNews,removed,ffs fuck uplifting shit
UpliftingNews,removed,im glad that they are celebrating diversity its such a fantastic step forward these poor people go through a lot living in africa i applaud their courage and i wish them all the best but in certain parts of africa if you are a red head you may end up on the dinner menu they believe that you have some sort of magical powers which of course is ludicrous if i had magical powers you wouldnt be able to catch me to eat me in the first place you moron my friend took a trip to climb mount kilimanjaro and has bright red hair she was advised by the tour operator to dye her hair black or face problems in uganda tanzania they have special reserves for albinos where they can live without being hunted although this does not mean they are safe as even immediate family members are willing to lure them away and kill them for a price you would be shocked what can get you in kenya and dont expect help from the police every level of government is just as corrupt as the crooks on the street when the westgate shopping mall in nairobi was bombed and the police got on the scene the very first thing they did was loot the place i dont think i could live in africa again sure every country has corruption but not as in your face as the majority of africa so when you see positive news like this it is an uplifting step forward
UpliftingNews,removed,here you go retard if i have to fight off your goddamned pit lunging at me by doing a rear naked choke strangle with my jacket and possibly losing a finger or two you can bet your ass im going to your house next to return the favor stats dont lie pitbulls are responsible for most dog violence and fatalities period thats not because theyre the only breed thats abused its because their owners are fucking retards and the dogs are bred for violence thats literally the only reason to get the breed not because its cute
UpliftingNews,removed,while id agree that the above poster is extreme in his prejudice it is not irrational to have a fear of a dog breed that is responsible for most dog violence
UpliftingNews,removed,im gladdened that youve had positive experiences with your pets thats wonderful it does not however override well known numbers
UpliftingNews,removed,the cognitive dissonance is strong with you
UpliftingNews,removed,no keep that thing on a tight leash if i even sniff that you lack physical control over your pit and it runs at me im emptying my pistol into its skull you will sued shortly after i dont blame the dog for being the animal it was bred to be i blame dipshit owners like you
UpliftingNews,removed,ive found this is the common argument pro pit bull owners can provide pit bulls were originally developed as fighting dogs from cross breeding bull baiting dogs and terriers furthermore evidence points to inherent violence in the canines ive listed since they have such low of total dog population whether or not they have a good owner may have less to do with it than many people think my opinion is of the nature that these dogs are not as active as they once were and instead of living on farm land being used to intimidate and work they are found in places like apartments where they might have the best owner in the world but the environment is not the best choice for the breed
UpliftingNews,removed,you dont need to breed them for violence they have already been bred for violence if a pit gets off its leash or i feel the owner lacks control if i see a pit running at me im emptying my pistol into its skull i dont have a fear of dogs i do dislike pits its almost like seeing a mountain lion walking down the street its simply dangerous and owned by pussy owners for some illconceived selfdefense of sorts you dont need to be tough to own and operate a firearm i dont seek trouble i just try to live my life unharassed the worst are the fucking morons with unleashed pits walking around id really like to boot them in the face not just for my sake but because those things approach small dogs and may eat them whats the other owner supposed to think dont murder my dog in front of my eyes please fuck pits blast their skulls in first pay the other owner to get a new mutt later
UpliftingNews,removed,its assholes like you why i carry keep that dog on a tight leash or locked up in your house and you have nothing to fear of course if you had a normal dog like a golden retriever or something not fuckheaded we wouldnt even need a conversation about your dog
UpliftingNews,removed,exactly the post i expected your original comment was nothing more than an appeal to emotion and anecdote that when confronted with the realities of the situation folded itself into a trite response
UpliftingNews,removed,im afraid the data findings from to disagree as pit bulls only make up under of the canine population furthermore people were maimed by the animal which can sometimes be worse than death if we want to start throwing opinions about
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder what is it about the words pit and bull that make you think this dog isnt eventually going to eat your face
UpliftingNews,removed,facts are in the us pitbull breeds kill more people each year than every single other dog combined not a dickhead im just saying things you wish werent true
UpliftingNews,removed,ok so then which owners are responsible for these dogs attacks than all other breeds hmm which owners why this breed
UpliftingNews,removed,you can cherry pick news stories to fit your agenda all you want the statistics dont lie chart breed bodily harm child victims adult victims deaths maimings of total dog population pit bull rottweiler husky wolf hybrid bullmastiff presa canario german shepherd pit bullmix akita chow doberman unidentified boxer german shepherdmix
UpliftingNews,removed,they are though its common to see that response from proponents of the breed they can be good dogs i get it they are also more aggressive by nature not simply by nurture and it can be measured throughout the pit bull population they have an inherent disposition to certain traits theyre loyal loving stubborn athletic and often times aggressive
UpliftingNews,removed,yep and they are all waaaaay more dangerous than any other dog regaurdless of breed
UpliftingNews,removed,id do anything that keeps a fucking year old from screaming on an airplane
UpliftingNews,removed,when someone starts a kidsfree airline thatll be true uplifting news
UpliftingNews,removed,even if that were true which it isnt it still doesnt cover the fact that when certain breeds do bite the results are much more vicious ask those vets which dog theyd least like to be bit by and then ask a doctor which dog theyd least like to be bit by and the bullshit comes to the forefront real quick without a doubt molosser breeds not only bite more often but also stand unmatched in their viciousness
UpliftingNews,removed,animals dying is never uplifting if you somehow find this to be happy news maybe you should keep it to yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,we had a girl bring her newborn to class last year it was quiet for a week and then it started screaming the professor was pretty resigned but a bunch of students got up in the middle of lecture and asked the girl to leave she was all offended too we were like lady we literally cant hear the prof talking
UpliftingNews,removed,you must have not had to watch someone in your family die from an obesityrelated illness being fat is not ok
UpliftingNews,removed,hey pigs get what they deserve this makes me even happier because it is in my home state also ladysmith is a shithole
UpliftingNews,removed,this is the last thing i would need some attention seeking dadict inflicting his little womb rat on everyone else when did everyone get so self obsessed
UpliftingNews,removed,oh i get it becuase hes a cop his death means more i stopped feeling sorry for them when they stopped working for us
UpliftingNews,removed,child trafficking is good business and good business is cutting your overheads
UpliftingNews,removed,youre the exact reason pits have such a bad reputation naw the reason they have a bad reputation is because they are worse than other breeds so if you own a breed known to be dangerous within miles of a child fuck you and if you choose to own a breed grouped as a pit and refuse to admit its damgerous fuck you to then you arrogant and ignorant peice of shit
UpliftingNews,removed,geez these comments are awful whatever happened to rule
UpliftingNews,removed,what kills me is that people use the dad of the year phrase like dads dont do great stuff for their kids when they can we all parents do what we can go the extra mile when we can we all have off days we all have inspirations but this dad of the year thing is usually used to imply that men are usually shitheads to their kids kinda pisses me off
UpliftingNews,removed,yes it is sociopath to not want to play the fathers halloween game what a perfect example of an entitlement attitude
UpliftingNews,removed,wow all cops must be great then
UpliftingNews,removed,nah i agree i hate flying it makes me nauseous it makes me anxious i just want to close my eyes and get through it as quick as possible someone coming up to me hey stranger feel free to make my kids day no thats rude dont talk to me on a flight sorry everyone knows its common courtesy to ignore everyone else unless youre giving them free candy to say happy halloween sorry you have to listen to a toddler your whole flight

UpliftingNews,removed,it could do minor burns in some areas
UpliftingNews,removed,hey if you cant do math thats not my problem but you dont have to be a dick about it and its also not my fault you have absolutely no grasp as to how kasich and dewine turned an opiate problem into a heroin epidemic because of their draconian laws and kneejerk reactions regarding the dispensing and prescription of narcotics in ohio absolutely no research whatsoever was done as to how these new laws would effect past present and future patients with chronic painhealth conditions aside from offering nothing but opinions people that deal with chronic pain are almost always better off without opiates there are all too many other viable options out there that will work better as far as i can tell you have no personal experience in this topic of discussion anyway plus your posts history comes across as some hostile douche who seems to think hes an expert in everything he decides to comment on
UpliftingNews,removed,whoever commented youre probably shadowbanned since we cannot see your comment
UpliftingNews,removed,and thats why there are no hand written sucide notesoh wait

UpliftingNews,removed,oh and lets not forget that most of them are there because of a lack of health care and community support no offense but this is just about the most naiive thing i have ever read in my entire life most homeless people are homeless because of either drug addictions or severe mental health issues most not all
UpliftingNews,removed,they were probably trying to steal the bags when they noticed there are bombs in there but i dont fucking care
UpliftingNews,removed,you know the elderly homeless although slow and dangerous behind the wheel sometimes aggressive can serve a purpose
UpliftingNews,removed,just tell the local meth user community there is copper wire in the pipe bombs and theyll have them all found dissembled and stripped in a matter of hours
UpliftingNews,removed,immigrants supposed to be deployed but instead got citizenship im not surprised expect more of this
UpliftingNews,removed,from the article rahami a naturalized citizen from afghanistan had lived at that address in elizabeth which is above a fried chicken restaurant reportedly owned by his father i now understand why ahmad rahami did it he lived above a fried chicken place years ago cosmo kramer demonstrated what that will do to a person
UpliftingNews,removed,going to guess this was the deleted comment will find out momentarily the article even says they looked in the backpack hoping there was something valuable in it i mean if i was in need i would too i think a comment in rnyc summed it up well terrorist meet petty theif
UpliftingNews,removed,these bums literally stole the bomb cant make this shit up
UpliftingNews,removed,thank the lord for bomb sniffing bums
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this uplifting the fbi nsa and cia have budgets in the billions of dollars per year collect all of our emails phone calls and text messages and homeless people are more competent than they are this is not uplifting news
UpliftingNews,removed,hillary rewarded them well
UpliftingNews,removed,they found a bomb reported it what else were they going to do not report it its not they were running late for work and didnt have time
UpliftingNews,removed,islam is a religion of peace

UpliftingNews,removed,being homeless in burlington vt or seattle is not the same as being homeless in the rest of the country bunch of no good drugged out able bodied males sitting around doing nothing
UpliftingNews,removed,they should do something great for him like put him on a one way bus to sunny san diego
UpliftingNews,removed,i shall thank the homeless twentyfive cents at a time
UpliftingNews,removed,so a bum found a bomb
UpliftingNews,removed,and while the homeless stay homeless and we pay the refugees when theyre the ones planting them there
UpliftingNews,removed,hes the hero that nobody wanted but we needed
UpliftingNews,removed,headline should read homeless man steals backpack then discovers its full of bombs

UpliftingNews,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit homeless men find bombs save lives in footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
UpliftingNews,removed,who planted the bombs there it seems like there is just going to b more of this happening in america we keep letting more foreigners in our country that want to harm us
UpliftingNews,removed,he finally did something to earn his ssi payments
UpliftingNews,removed,stumble upon something and report it to police be praised as heroes pretty luck based to be a hero i guess lets not praise the people who had to deal with the bombs
UpliftingNews,removed,looks like a pit so itll have to be muzzled if it goes out in public cheers little one
UpliftingNews,removed,so im not usually a violent man but shit like this makes me want to reign fiery vengeance down on the monster that would do this to a puppy
UpliftingNews,removed,honestly people do much worse some people if their dog gets pregnant they will just drown the puppies sometimes they wait till the moms done weening but nost the time its soon after birth i had a neighbor who did that exact thing openly admitted to it as well we ended up taking the mother dog just before he moved away as he was abusing her as well we ended up naming her lucky so honestly abandoning a live dog is so so much better than what people actually do and thats the truely sad part
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel like i should have been born with a straighter nose and pretty blonde hair therefore i am entitled to plastic surgery and a personal hair stylist and colorist in prison i shall be awarded these things that i need ahead of veterans who were horribly mutilated while defending our country because my feelings are my feelings and therefore they are the most important thing in the entire universe
UpliftingNews,removed,stupid fucking australians truly a disgusting people the only good australian is a dead australian
UpliftingNews,removed,ill be downvoted to hell for pointing it out but of the people posting here are fine with eating meat dead animal flesh have you seen the hell those animals go through just because the puppy is cute doesnt make its worth more then any of these other innocent animals
UpliftingNews,removed,its retarded because they are so damn valuable in seattle its so damn responsible that like everyone spays and neuters and is responsible with their pets and there are huge long lists to volunteer at the humane society to adopt any animals here you have to have a fenced yard and all this shit plus pay out the nose you could sell any puppy in seattle for a few hundred bucks in a day if ur just willing to take cash on the spot without the whole run around im seriously considering just doing puppy runs to like idaho or something places where you can get a dog no problem where i grew up puppies were free you would just go to the grocery store and there would be a box of puppies outside if i could find a decent source for cheap or unwanted puppies i could make so much money flipping puppies downtown id just stand on the corner by all the drug dealers and slang puppies yo man you need a puppy i got this cute little guy cash right now dawg
UpliftingNews,removed,if you throw a puppy in the trash you are truly and unequivocally a piece of shit
UpliftingNews,removed,let me tell you a story my relatives own a garbage disposal company while on a route a male relative of mine found a litter of kittens in a dumpster what did he do tossed them into the back of the truck and crushed them with the trucks hydraulic compactor oh then he told the story later while laughing about it some people dont have the ability to feel feelings
UpliftingNews,removed,my mother told me a story about her grandmother this was in communist europe and how whenever her cat had a litter she handdrowned all of them in a tub newborn baby kittens fucking brutal but either that or they would die on the streets she couldnt afford to keep em all
UpliftingNews,removed,unlike at reddit where the saviors are banned from expressing their perspective you actually like reddit its like hillary parasitic
UpliftingNews,removed,a song about my
UpliftingNews,removed,this summer a coworker of my cousins girlfriend was going out for lunch during the work day she heard some meowing went searching for the source found a tiny kitten in a dumpster with its paws tied up with string so she rescued it brought it into the office then home some people are fucking disgusting how can anyone basically commit murder like that
UpliftingNews,removed,if you want to risk your own life thats your business but stopping traffic especially under those conditions can get other people killed all to kill a cat thats dying anyway youre an asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,i once called the rspca to come and pick up a dog that had obviously been mistreated damn it was skin and bone looked starved and half the flesh on its body was torn away i could see bone in a few places i rushed home and called the rspca and advised them of the situation and asked if they could send someone around to help capture it as i was scared of catching something as there was blood and puss all over its body the rspca said there was nothing they could do unless i brought it in and they were closing for the day this was at in the afternoon when i returned to the area the dog was at it was gone and i could not find it again from that day forward i always tell people the story and i have not donated a penny to them and anyone that does i get every angry with also when telling my uncle this story he said he once had an rspca representative knock on the door and ask for minutes to explain what the rspca does and basically beg for a donation when he was finished minutes later he was verbally abusive when my uncle gave him as a donation and said that he felt that he had wasted his time and effort in speaking to them he took back his donation and told the guy to get off his property yes there are some decent people that work for the rspca but the fact that there are so many people that are obviously only in it for the money is very clearly showing where any donations go to salaries that are very big and to buy new cars for employees to use only for personal use and not in any way for use to help animals unless called out by the police or other large organisation
UpliftingNews,removed,seriously a post on facebook or just text few friends and a lot of people will come running to get it or give to an animal shelter or somethingfucking asshole went to extreme length to make sure its not found rather than just drop it somewhere to be taken care ofhow could people be so cruel
UpliftingNews,removed,its a dog there will be more later whether something is precious is subjective rather unfortunate and perhaps a little cruel that someone would leave it on a rubbish heap but they could have just killed ithad it euthanized
UpliftingNews,removed,what is this shithole
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,the idea that there is something wrong with wondering where your money is going is pretty ridiculous
UpliftingNews,removed,i probably wouldve just tried to run em over the rest of the way
UpliftingNews,removed,i prefer to donate my money more wisely such as to the clinton fraudation s but no really direct giving is the way to go most of the bigger charities are all just money holes red cross im looking at you
UpliftingNews,removed,so like capitalism works because of the occasional uplifting news fuck that shit unsubscribing from this shit sub
UpliftingNews,removed,check your trisexual gender priviledge you neckbeard i am an attack helicopter
UpliftingNews,removed,my previous employer did a small social experiment once we live and work in a smaller town and there is a population of homeless natives here they used to hang out in the alleyway behind our shop one day he decided to give one of them a legit job with the company and offered him wages he accepted the offer and my employer even set him up in a one bedroom apt and bought him some work boots gloves etc this went ok all the way up to payday once he got that money we never saw him again and him and his buddies trashed the apartment i dont believe you can help anyone who doesnt want to be helped in any way shape or form
UpliftingNews,removed,did you read the article its literally in the first paragraph your comment is completely invalid
UpliftingNews,removed,it could very well be that one group of people is really inferior to another just because you dont like a conclusion doesnt mean its automatically wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,wait so you bought this bus for me yes erm ook thank you i dont really know what to do with a double decker bus though get in the bus no thank you get in the bus margaret oh my god why do you have a gun oh jesus get in the fucking bus or i will rape you right here in the street sobbing gun shots corpse raping laughter cannibalism

UpliftingNews,removed,u give a nigga in extreme poverty here in the states and he gonna buy himself a pair of air jordans xd
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting huh gosh yes tossing endless money into a bottomless pit known as africa we have spent billions trying to rescue them from themselves and have yet to see a return meanwhile actual americans are starving and homeless and the streets and you lot just cant get enough of your exotic pet minorities
UpliftingNews,removed,they buy a bunch of corn
UpliftingNews,removed,its funny how negros literally live off white mans inventions they literally cannot survive decently without some type of white mans intervention in most of africa the negros are living in mud huts and eating eachother and voodooing it up got to love christians though they think they are in the right doing you cant help people who cant help themselves folks that could have been used to help local communities homeless or project people put some negros miles away first before their community friends and even family
UpliftingNews,removed,ok ive gotta ask am i the only one here who notices that she is wearing a dress with rey mysterio on it
UpliftingNews,removed,her shit is gonna be pure corn
UpliftingNews,removed,tfw when uneducated kenyans use welfare grants better than american blacks who waste their govt incomes on malt liquor fast food baby mamas and drugs
UpliftingNews,removed,its such a waste of money to send over to these countries you know your investment will never be repaid and shes apparently spending it on corn and bananas like apes
UpliftingNews,removed,i love how you call it a stupid quesiton but gave a dumb fucking answer doing your own research isnt an answer to the question its a stupid question not because its invalid but because its already been so conclusively answered that doesnt make a question stupid but go ahead and carry on being a huge asshole lol
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre just going to waste it or get robbed being in poverty isnt about having a lack of resources at ones disposal its about being too fucking stupid to figure out how to use what theyve got
UpliftingNews,removed,didnt read the article just looked at the picture apparently what happens is they buy a whole lot of corn
UpliftingNews,removed,how niceheres a grand for a new roofkid down the road is dying in agony for want of dollar meds its just westerners playing god
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah every person in extreme poverty will react exactly the same nice premise
UpliftingNews,removed,wtf to a homeless person
UpliftingNews,removed,my wife adrienne and i are longtime supporters of unconditional cash giving i think this is really wonderful except for the fact that people like this usually advocate the unconditional cash giving of other peoples money
UpliftingNews,removed,general angst about the savior barbie complex where western people go out to save people in poor countries by telling them what they should do — often a selfserving endeavor since we currently travel abroad fulltime and kenya is an incredible country we decided to head out for a field visit and take a real peek under gds kimono k
UpliftingNews,removed,i could get way more corn then that for she got ripped off
UpliftingNews,removed,poverty is always relative to the society somebody lives in those people are not poor also that first sentence my wife adrienne and i are longtime supporters of unconditional cash giving lol
UpliftingNews,removed,throwing money at africa is not a solution weve been doing this for years with little real result a solution is building infrastructure support organizations which build china has actually lead this development
UpliftingNews,removed,they used the money to setup a scam call center
UpliftingNews,removed,why has nobody mentioned her awesome rey mysterio luchador shirt
UpliftingNews,removed,no jackass its not systemic suffering they are incapable of fixing themselves not due to the system but due to themselves the average iq of africa is they somehow magically forget how farming and house building works and somehow you bleeding heart cunts think that the only way to help them is for the white man to jump in and toss a few bucks their way then theysurprise buy drugs and stupid shit and then never get better you keep feeding a disease because it makes your tiny little ego grow ever so slightly because you think tossing endless money at a minority is somehow noble that makes you a dip shit not a savior nothing more how many fucking wells have we dug for them only to have them shit in the holes how many fucking houses have we built only to see them burnt down or bull dozed a year later metal pulled out of the homes to salvage in exchange for drugs fuck that fuck africa and fuck you end of story fuck your white guilt and your self hatred fuck your ignoring of your neighbors in favor of whatever exotic minority that some shit tier actor told you that you should care about fuck you and fuck your bleeding heart savior of the world system
UpliftingNews,removed,we should really help these guys instead of those muslem terrorist refugees
UpliftingNews,removed,oh look at mr fucking fancy pants over here making us all look bad
UpliftingNews,removed,no offense but these are the nuances that are a given that dont really add anything to the discussion other than to be selfserving

UpliftingNews,removed,unfortunate thing is that this kind of exposure will bring all the wrong people to this page rip ofsds
UpliftingNews,removed,me too im hoping doesnt care
UpliftingNews,removed,how many miliseconds after ir was posted here did someone post on their site that mr leo was literly worse than hitler
UpliftingNews,removed,i almost want to downvote this just so that it isnt seen by trolls

UpliftingNews,removed,and then someone wrote an article about it thereby exposing it to millions of unwitting internet denizens oh well im sure the site will enjoy its new home on a farm in the countryside
UpliftingNews,removed,you sure as hell shouldnt put this on reddit
UpliftingNews,removed,well congratulations itll be ruined now
UpliftingNews,removed,i have the feeling that now that someone is pointing out the lack of trolls and drama that people will invade that site with the specific purpose of removing that distinction
UpliftingNews,removed,now that you posted this people will go ruin it good job
UpliftingNews,removed,you dont realize this yet op but youve just unleashed the gates of hell upon this peaceful internet haven the trolls will soon roll in barricade the doors
UpliftingNews,removed,and then you post it on reddit
UpliftingNews,removed,dont encourage
UpliftingNews,removed,who cares
UpliftingNews,removed,unfortunately of them were considered not fit for adoption and were euthanized hopefully not but its what tends to happen in most animal hoardingneglect stories i cant help but think so they had a rough life but your rescue killed them
UpliftingNews,removed,hes saying that if most of the dogs were euthanized then being rescued is actually what killed them
UpliftingNews,removed,fake news
UpliftingNews,removed,personally this doesnt seem uplifting its depressing
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting man i hate this subreddit since it just makes me depressed instead
UpliftingNews,removed,this is uplifting news they died
UpliftingNews,removed,so one of them got to watch the other one died then lingered in emotional agony for a few more hours before they died that sucks
UpliftingNews,removed,there is nothing uplifting about this
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting lel
UpliftingNews,removed,im not subscribed to this sub but it seems like every time i see it on rall the stories arent all that uplifting its usually just depressing stuff with a hint of silver lining
UpliftingNews,removed,rdepressingnewswithsilverlining
UpliftingNews,removed,interesting and impressive but im not sure learning that our country was even more racist than originally thought is uplifting news
UpliftingNews,removed,i wish i could steal it and get away with that

UpliftingNews,removed,n e r u o k
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder how this went for all the female annies out there
UpliftingNews,removed,no
UpliftingNews,removed,this its just another christmas where people pretend to care because its expected of them i would rather people make their own ruok day where they just call people they havent spoken too in a while on any random day the idea is nice but if i got a call from someone just because some calendar told them to it would probably rob the event of any meaning kind of like when people use calendar reminders for birthdays
UpliftingNews,removed,ah yes i presume that would be black history month
UpliftingNews,removed,when will toys r anus come to international womens day
UpliftingNews,removed,if you dont buy people an r u ok card and a customary piece of almost out of date food then you are a monster
UpliftingNews,removed,its a pile of nonsense and everyone involved should kill themselves
UpliftingNews,removed,really could have the opposite effect if you think you are doing good and all of a sudden everyone you know starts calling you worried
UpliftingNews,removed,for best results slit vertically not horizontally all your problems will disappear

UpliftingNews,removed,arlington coat factory
UpliftingNews,removed,came for uplifting news left mad at red tape and inflexible bureaucrats
UpliftingNews,removed,her small contribution to the war effort is noted and appreciated however i wouldnt tout her own personal efforts as signifying that the service of female pilots in world war ii equaled that of the men who fought seeing as an overwhelming majority of pilots were actually men
UpliftingNews,removed,xpost from rnoonegivesashit
UpliftingNews,removed,in the news today beautiful blonde blueeyed girl who is a high school cheerleader with a perfect body and a carefree life finds herself facing a curable but very dangerous illness like millions of other people but unlike them she is showered with love media attention and support becoming even more popular and wellloved awwww so sweet
UpliftingNews,removed,outrageous wonderful victory sick to my stomach that its coming in i mean really possible xpost to wtf
UpliftingNews,removed,women arent equal because they dont have penises the penis is extra high density body mass which shows gods holy preference dont you fools see
UpliftingNews,removed,dont give them ideas
UpliftingNews,removed,it was a joke also yeah in middle school sheesh how dare i like a music that doesnt agree with your opinion
UpliftingNews,removed,so you think everyone who contributed in any manner to wwii should be buried at arlington national cemetery a military cemetery
UpliftingNews,removed,ridiculous that this is news there are plenty of people who are not fuck ups that run triathlons who deserve articles written about them
UpliftingNews,removed,so she saw no combat and shot down not a single nazi not equal
UpliftingNews,removed,youre making stuff up they got credit and they could be buried in other vet cemeteries too just not arlington because of certain rules which also affected hundreds of thousands of men
UpliftingNews,removed,mchughs memo which terry harmon obtained under the freedom of information act says army lawyers reviewed the rules in and determined that wasps and other world war ii veterans classified as active duty designees are not eligible for inurnment placement of their urns in an aboveground structure at arlington the largest group affected by the memo is the merchant marine nearly of whose members served during world war ii the wasp program was much smaller just over women were accepted into the program which ran from to in a statement army spokesman paul prince said the cemetery superintendent in had no authority to allow wasps remains into the cemetery under federal law he said wasps are eligible only for burial at cemeteries run by the department of veterans affairs not arlington national cemetery which is run by the army
UpliftingNews,removed,does this mean gw bush was not a coward for being a jet fighter pilot in the national guard during the vietnam war
UpliftingNews,removed,the rare case of antiwasp discrimination in the us ok ok different wasp
UpliftingNews,removed,no they shouldnt be veterans same can be said for women personal on deployment they dont go into the firefight
UpliftingNews,removed,so whats your suggestion then let the kid leave and just walk the shoes off his fucking feet thatll sure show nike
UpliftingNews,removed,his new drug of choice steroids p i kid good for him i hope hes able to keep it up
UpliftingNews,removed,insyeaf of railing a line eat an apple 😂
UpliftingNews,removed,their service was far from equal in no way is a support role equal to a combat role i think it is disrespectful to veterans and fallen military personel to even suggest so
UpliftingNews,removed,this nigga is just trying to get laid let him do his thing
UpliftingNews,removed,what a joke
UpliftingNews,removed,while in america they been equals
UpliftingNews,removed,now reading how this problem was finally fixed makes me proud to be an american
UpliftingNews,removed,are you talking about this specific situation or not he had an opportunity to help someone and he took it was he supposed to leave his work with this kid to find him some crueltyfree shoes thats just not realistic for this situation do you think the people who downvoted you are denying that nike factories use child slave labor no your comment is just useless and irrelevant youre just making an obvious point that literally no one disagrees with so you can pat yourself on the back or get mad or whatever your thing is
UpliftingNews,removed,she was in the army during a war time period a firstofitskind army unit these are false statements clear and simple no that is not the same as actual combat you are not only trying to twist history you are trying to twist reality if this is the uplifiting subreddi and truth doesnt matter okay you just won a million dollars get uplifted
UpliftingNews,removed,i guess they didnt get as much credit as fighter pilots did because they didnt risk as much
UpliftingNews,removed,seriously thousands and thousands of male pilots died in wwii to say their service was equal is absolutely absurd literal bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,the article is false otherwise this whole news and ruling wouldnt make sense and the wikipedia page doesnt claim that and is carefully construed to be correct maybe you should read it before linking it the bill gave them va benefits as active duty members of the military it didnt make them suddenly a part of the army all deaings were with the air force it was all carefully construed and what you claim is false
UpliftingNews,removed,really you think its much more dangerous than actual combat how many wasps died in training because over pilots died in combat theres a big difference between live ammunition and live ammunition trying to hit the target
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean the units that actually went risk their lives and die in combat
UpliftingNews,removed,your gay son on the other hand
UpliftingNews,removed,yay puppies were found i mean never mind that actual humans are still burried alive and all butyay puppies
UpliftingNews,removed,its not about jobs its about maintaining energy scarcity coal can be controlled and kept in the hands of a few people how do you monopolize sunlight
UpliftingNews,removed,a majority of planned parenthoods budget is spent on treating stdstis and birth control the group literally spends most of their money on letting people have sex and fixing the mistakes caused by the sex
UpliftingNews,removed,this is the chick who sings the terrible verse on that terrible chainsmokers song right
UpliftingNews,removed,thats fucking bullshit it might happen someday which is fine so long as it is market driven but it is a fake news factoid for today
UpliftingNews,removed,i see absolutely no religious data in that report what i do see right away is highly latino concentrated areas are the highest infection rates sanctuary states a majority of latinos are catholic i see a pattern here
UpliftingNews,removed,can we not have partisan bullshit in upliftingnews that kind of defeats the point of this whole sub
UpliftingNews,removed,like it or not planned parenthood is a partisan group in addition to whatever medical care they give they provide and encourage abortions and this sub claims to be an escape from the controversial news claiming that a proabortion stance is not controversial is fallacious and you know it
UpliftingNews,removed,there are people who are literally alive right now because of plenty of controversial people that would not be considered uplifting would the story about trump saving someone from a mugger be uplifting even though millions of people hate him saving a life does not make you universally uplifting the entire point of this sub is to have articles that are noncontroversial and have widespread appeal do you really think a proplanned parenthood story fits that bill there is literally an antipp march on dc next weekend
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this for uplifting the roots of planned parenthood are dark httpwwwdianedewcomsangerhtm
UpliftingNews,removed,agreed what the hell is uplifting about more dead babies
UpliftingNews,removed,people who encourage suffering and fight against education are not welcome here
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah get with the times murdering babies is fine now
UpliftingNews,removed,killing babiesgood deed got it
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting planned parenthood is corrupt to the core httpsoversighthousegovinteractivepageplannedparenthood
UpliftingNews,removed,this a clarification of the definition of consent not a totally new law youll already be guilty of rape if you have sex with an unconscious person here it the courts have had to set the definition instead of legislation because the legislation wasnt specific enough
UpliftingNews,removed,their population will plummet
UpliftingNews,removed,intracranial
UpliftingNews,removed,there will be no sex in ireland then
UpliftingNews,removed,and the birthrate plummets
UpliftingNews,removed,this is probably how most of ireland breeds anyway
UpliftingNews,removed,iv seen two girls lie about being raped one of them was drunk and regretted it so she got the whole school thinking she was raped i ended up eating the poor fellows ass because of her lies the second got drunk totaled her car so she said a bunch of black gang bangers gang banged her at gun point then wrecked the car
UpliftingNews,removed,does law include guys who are drunk and fall asleep during or does it include guys who get wasted bring a lassie home and pass out before it happens only for the girl to have sex anyway and if thats the case and the lassie gets intentionally pregnant is there any safeguards that protect the guy due the rapist raping him
UpliftingNews,removed,or you could just ban altar boys from serving alcohol
UpliftingNews,removed,im pretty sure this is already a law where i live i fell asleep drunk before and now no one ever has sex with me
UpliftingNews,removed,you dont need to lash out at the world there are people willing to help if you just ask
UpliftingNews,removed,have you thought about drinking bleach and not replying to me
UpliftingNews,removed,a lot of rape laws require penetration you dont know as much about this as you think you do
UpliftingNews,removed,where did he touch you
UpliftingNews,removed,were his fingers coarse on your delicate anus did you bleed afterwards
UpliftingNews,removed,you must be american nobody else can be this stupid
UpliftingNews,removed,you sjw cucks are easily offended next time you are raped i hope it is with a jeroboam of wine
UpliftingNews,removed,then how they are going to reproduce
UpliftingNews,removed,isnt that all irish sex
UpliftingNews,removed,how is it not discrimination that almost nobody will hire someone with a felony record they deserve to be discriminated against so other people will see them and go damni better not break the law
UpliftingNews,removed,shouldnt you be getting drunk and watching wrestling no one would miss you if you killed yourself

UpliftingNews,removed,fuck off with the clickbait title op eat a bag of dicks and die

UpliftingNews,removed,today i walked out of a pizza shop a fat black woman was walking towards the entrance i looked her in the eye and asked if she was going inside she ignored me i held open the door for her anyway she walked around me and rudely said that she wasnt going in
UpliftingNews,removed,hey hold my public defecation for you
UpliftingNews,removed,as a male i stopped holding doors for random women years ago i felt like many women feel as men should hold the door and many never thanked me so i only hold doors for bros now adays sorta funny
UpliftingNews,removed,the was black
UpliftingNews,removed,i like to play clash of clans and i use httpmaxclashgemscom everybody uses this now yxpxe
UpliftingNews,removed,black women in a row bad results strike that were downright negative results with one simply huffing at me the other two snarled like the wildebeests they were i dont hold doors for wildebeests anymore
UpliftingNews,removed,call me a cynic but i suspect the black people just wanted a free paint job on their house
UpliftingNews,removed,youre allowed to say blacks
UpliftingNews,removed,people were white try this in chimpcago or any asian city anywhere in the world
UpliftingNews,removed,this is why i try not to hold doors open for people you hold it for one and other cunts come straight after and youre stood there waiting
UpliftingNews,removed,call me an asshole but this sort of stuff didnt happen as frequently before trump started his campaign hes unleashed a lot of vile filth into society imo
UpliftingNews,removed,in my experiance if you usually hold the door for the same people eg girls in the class at first they express the gratitude then they get used to it and latter on they start to rely on it and when youre not there to hold the door for them they get lostangry
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder how many millions she makes without this sacrifice
UpliftingNews,removed,congratulations she did what any normal feeling human being should do
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,why like i get its a nice thing to do but when youve worked harder then the janitor to reach a position with lots of competition that takes education knowledge and talent to do well then why should you have to take a massive pay cut for someone who needs a high school education for their job
UpliftingNews,removed,socialist
UpliftingNews,removed,how the hell does she get paid millions what does she even do
UpliftingNews,removed,no ordinary woman on the planet would have done such a thing that is unthinkable but apparently shes not like other women
UpliftingNews,removed,so the person once dubbed the worst journalist in the history of the world is still making million a year
UpliftingNews,removed,so sweet the should take note
UpliftingNews,removed,how generous good thing she can still keep her out of her she makes a year
UpliftingNews,removed,til katie couric is a person and not just a measure equal to approximately two and a half pounds of excrement
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe the problem with the shows budget is that theyre paying someone million a year to read a teleprompter
UpliftingNews,removed,man you are one hell of a condescending entitled asshole someone does something incredibly generous and all you can say is see that wasnt so bad fuck you man
UpliftingNews,removed,she should have been fired after that edited video honestly
UpliftingNews,removed,does this mean well need to adjust the couric scale
UpliftingNews,removed,about a year she can afford this
UpliftingNews,removed,this is why women make less than men most men would not have done this
UpliftingNews,removed,somebody is jelly
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope you go around giving a few grand a year to others ya tosser
UpliftingNews,removed,this might be more impressive if she were an actual journalist instead of a thoroughly dishonest propagandist
UpliftingNews,removed,here is a crumb back for the little people see how cool i am couric
UpliftingNews,removed,given that she doesnt care about facts it would seem her news would be very inexpensive to produce just edit a story to fit her narrative save millions
UpliftingNews,removed,she also cut the gun interview but lets not talk about that
UpliftingNews,removed,million but how much is she paid she probably asked to keep it quiet cause million is probably not enough to save jobs and didnt want people asking how much are you paid why didnt you give up more all she does is read from a teleprompter
UpliftingNews,removed,how much was she making to lie about the news
UpliftingNews,removed,tomorrow on reddit studies show women make less than men for same position s
UpliftingNews,removed,good on her but she still needs to be fired for that manipulative piece she did on that gun control story for yahoo
UpliftingNews,removed,i just took a shit and it was at least courics
UpliftingNews,removed,wow what a fucking hero a true american champion i hope she can make due on the remains of her pittance of a salary
UpliftingNews,removed,people out there feel angry entitled and miserly and love to project their own selfhate outwards bernie bros
UpliftingNews,removed,shes so brave
UpliftingNews,removed,shes still a liar and no amount of good pr stunts will change that
UpliftingNews,removed,a salarythat can sustain a hit and still be fine is one you should have felt bad about accepting in the first place or even denied in exchange for other equity optionsnot even ceos of large companies take a salary of that amount
UpliftingNews,removed,were seriously praising this woman for dropping from to that salary is obscene
UpliftingNews,removed,hit piece about gun control lied about a bunch of stuff i think a producercommitted a felony during the filming
UpliftingNews,removed,she had million how about cutting it until its not a aberration of affluence riding on the backs literally everyone else im not talking about communism here people just a system of capitalism that isnt unregulated and completely run amok
UpliftingNews,removed,because she is a lying cunt
UpliftingNews,removed,so just to be clear here youre not jealous of someone who makes million a year or even better why not take of your earnings and give it out if i ever have an figure salary i surely hope thats the least that im doing
UpliftingNews,removed,cbs should just cut couric completely
UpliftingNews,removed,welp time to stop using her name to measure shit
UpliftingNews,removed,while it is truly a good deed one has to ask why was katie couric making that kind of money to begin with what exactly does she do for it only thing i know of is she had a husband who died of colon cancer and garnered the sympathy of a few people as a journalist she iswas mediocre at best i have read in multiple places over the years she isnt a very nice person and she isnt very attractive imo none of this justifies a salary so high she can just take a mil paycut please someone tell me what she does to deserve that kind of money she doesnt defend our country our streets nor teach our youth she isnt a mentor nor a leader many whom have worked her have said she is just a plain bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,what a hero s
UpliftingNews,removed,shes ugly
UpliftingNews,removed,oh wow what a saint she is probably if she hadnt done that then her colleagues wouldve reported on it live by the sword die by the sword
UpliftingNews,removed,why because of that story she straight up lied about she lost all respect
UpliftingNews,removed,way to contribute to the wage gap katie
UpliftingNews,removed,haha what a sacrifice
UpliftingNews,removed,katie couric the biggest cunt the world has ever seen this one act wont save this bitch from hell hope she rots in the fiery depths of satan
UpliftingNews,removed,why its obvious just bullshit stop being so naive and retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,wow what a powerhouse for news integrity she is a woodward and bernstein for all time truly what makes america great is katie couric
UpliftingNews,removed,katie couric is not a journalist and gets paid to be pretty and talk
UpliftingNews,removed,oh yay the overpaid limousine liberal gave up some of her millions isnt she wonderful
UpliftingNews,removed,because cbs is losing money give me a break
UpliftingNews,removed,because reddit loves hating anyone more successful than them with damn near zero exemptions
UpliftingNews,removed,gender wage gap right here
UpliftingNews,removed,how is she going to buy groceries on a million salary though talk about slummin it
UpliftingNews,removed,the most impressive part is that this is the most upvoted shillary post of the week
UpliftingNews,removed,oh well what a fucking hero
UpliftingNews,removed,oh wow she gave up million of her million net worth wow what a hero fuck the rich c l a s s w a r n o w
UpliftingNews,removed,katie couric is really good at cutting things just ask the virginia citizens defense league
UpliftingNews,removed,there are many people in the world who can never pay rent in an actual apartment so would you think its perfectly reasonable if you saw the thread of people complaining about how rich you are and how it discuss them and how you should be donating money to them jealousy never helped anyone all it does is create negative hateful emotions its one thing to want to be like someone is another to hate someone for what they have someone always will have it better than you and someone will always have it worse
UpliftingNews,removed,the being bravewell okay then
UpliftingNews,removed,lol what an idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this exactly uplifting news this is just a reminder of how much the rich are hoarding resources she shouldnt even be making so much in the first place
UpliftingNews,removed,lol no programmer early in my career which wasnt too far back i realized that working for others is only going to get you so far broke off and started my own business serving smaller companies im on call and whenever i get a new project you might not see me outside for a few days while not getting into exacts i earn enough in a year that i can afford to buy a lastgen ferrari
UpliftingNews,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfkwwepriym
UpliftingNews,removed,i took a bowel movement once that weighed about of her it was quite fantastic
UpliftingNews,removed,i think this is more telling of the old dinosaur media than her i mean she married a rich old guy then he died so its not like shes really going to be missing much million that isnt much she should try harder
UpliftingNews,removed,in she cites this as being a wage gap
UpliftingNews,removed,bitch look like a fish xd
UpliftingNews,removed,jesus just taze that retard into submission and be done with it
UpliftingNews,removed,your mum has a history of swallowing
UpliftingNews,removed,taking it home so he can shoot it
UpliftingNews,removed,i can only assume this will end badly for him
UpliftingNews,removed,do you think this would have happened if the roles had been reversed i think not
UpliftingNews,removed,it would rarely happen the other way around
UpliftingNews,removed,getting tested for hiv and not fucking everything that walks
UpliftingNews,removed,and it will change absolutely nothing just a whole lot of burned calories for nothing nothing sadder than a sore loser
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting all they did was march
UpliftingNews,removed,difference is that was a legitimate cause this is just a bunch of idiots throwing a tantrum for note getting their way like children sad
UpliftingNews,removed,oh please it is definitely anti trump the protesters even littered all around trump tower with their signs afterwards what rights do men have that women dont this was a march of white privileged women who were upset that they lost for the most part
UpliftingNews,removed,trump isnt a misogynist only an idiot would think that his campaign was run by a women and he hired tons of women in high positions in his company stating that they are often better at the job than men and so what if he said some things in a private conversation every guy talks like that welcome to the real world this is just a tamper tantrum by special snowflakes who didnt get their way
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean the islamic terrorist who ploughed his car into a crowd in melbourne australia yesterday killing several people yeah thats pretty damn sad
UpliftingNews,removed,hes been in office for a single day now what has he exactly done wrong to these people ill answer that for you nothing this is just a very childish overreaction by people who cant control their emotions and whove been told their entire lives theyre special and can have anything they want well too bad little snowflakes the sun has risen

UpliftingNews,removed,i like that other people have noticed how easy it is to trigger those who call you a snowflake or sjw and how much of a safespace is required for people who mock others for needing said space weve come full circle and see the troll for who he is
UpliftingNews,removed,the person wearing the shirt only owns that one shirt he spends all of his money on his gun collection ammunition and a nra membership hes saying that youd have to kill him before hed give up his favorite shirt his underpants also sport the same pic and text
UpliftingNews,removed,well they have their own blonde lunatic to worry about i suppose
UpliftingNews,removed,denver isnt full of murderous conservative psychos so yeah its pretty shocking
UpliftingNews,removed,so go suck some cock fucking cuck
UpliftingNews,removed,what the hell do they want seems like another crybaby trump is president protest kind of undermines whatever women issue they have which im not really sure what the hell they want seems like more hate mongering of women voted trump i thought i see signs for free tampons abortion killings things like that hard to take this seriously
UpliftingNews,removed,to my knowledge france has bigger domestic issues than the puppet running america no
UpliftingNews,removed,so is reddit just going to be nothing but antitrump posts till no sub is safe from this bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,bye dont come back
UpliftingNews,removed,the largest aerial firefighter ever used is a boeing aerial firefighter known as the global supertanker that can carry us gallons l fed by a pressurized drop system would personally support filling these with gasoline and using them to fight the left one sweep and it would be wall to wall crispy critters its time we fight leftist violence with violence of our own and simply end them
UpliftingNews,removed,countries have borders and walls for a reasonmexico has a wall on their southern border but they dont want us to have the same securityif you are coming here illegally then you are a criminal
UpliftingNews,removed,its sad when you cant even look at rupliftingnews without seeing a comment section filled with vitriol about trump
UpliftingNews,removed,marching for what first world women arent being persecuted or mistreated they have the same if not more rights as men
UpliftingNews,removed,shameful
UpliftingNews,removed,huh who did the fighting and dying in those revolutions
UpliftingNews,removed,im sorry the guy who hired steve bannon and other racists is now upset that we are labeling the racism dont wanna be called a racist stop supporting racists
UpliftingNews,removed,i love when a donald poster forgets hes using his alt
UpliftingNews,removed,im not lying im not subscribed to any partisan subreddits like thedonald only to subreddits that are supposed to be neutral but all i see recently is a lot of hate and nastiness towards trump and his supporters
UpliftingNews,removed,these women are protesting lies propagated by the clinton news network i feel sad for them
UpliftingNews,removed,and in every war in american history we have documented proof of women fighting in disguise by god several whole divisions of them im sure also just because women werent physically fighting doesnt mean they didnt help the effort yeah thats a good point working in a factory dying on omaha beach
UpliftingNews,removed,i think that this is what you meant since you apparently believe that the most murderous military machine in the world is apparently tumblr feminist utopia and only your orange dad will save it
UpliftingNews,removed,im not ignoranti love when a liberal disagrees with youinstead of just saying it in a civil manner they chose to call you names ie caricature of ignoranceracistsexisthomophobicredneckgun toting rednecketcetcetcits on par with a child saying i know you arebut what am i

UpliftingNews,removed,never underestimate the will of a middle class white woman to vaguely preen about her moral superiority
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah this subreddit sucks
UpliftingNews,removed,good to hear that theyre out burning some calories god knows american women need it
UpliftingNews,removed,then you shouldnt have posted your views in the first place your felt compelled to share your theories but wouldnt engage in the discourse if you really wanted to keep things uplifting you probably should have just told people to see your post history like you did when you deflected legitimate questioning you should probably get off your high horse thank you
UpliftingNews,removed,we need to ban politics from this sub
UpliftingNews,removed,you need to get out of your own house
UpliftingNews,removed,haha loser this isnt uplifting its sad that people are so dumb
UpliftingNews,removed,they better be marching their asses back to the kitchen
UpliftingNews,removed,it would be great if we can keep politics out of rupliftingnews its just too divisive for this sub this article is propaganda pure and simple these womens march protests were astroturf organized by liberal political action groups and are being portrayed as some kind of spontaneous organic movement by mprnpr who is also funded by the same groups this is what they mean when they say fake news
UpliftingNews,removed,why are men from mn such sad pathetic cucks

UpliftingNews,removed,besides free stuff and entitlements what was the march about
UpliftingNews,removed,i said fuck this lady and fuck anyone trying to remove choice from a families life when dealing with circumstances that are private and none of your business do you want women to go back to coat hangers

UpliftingNews,removed,his is this uplifting is because idiots join lonely idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,see this is why i dont take any of you idiots seriously you didnt provide me with one actual instance of oppression you just gave me a bunch of emotional drivel why dont you educate yourself then come back to me because i know for a fact anyone marching right now wouldnt know real oppression if it smacked them in the face
UpliftingNews,removed,bunch of idiots protesting democracy
UpliftingNews,removed,some people are garbage they dont realise what they are doing is harming others when they litter litter doesnt disappear people have to clean it some people volunteer their free time to do it too
UpliftingNews,removed,this whole thing was a bloated shit showmadonna saying she wanted to bomb the white houselock er up
UpliftingNews,removed,ive seen some trumpanzees try to spin this as a riot despite zero arrests with this many protesters smdh
UpliftingNews,removed,minnesota is a libral cesspool
UpliftingNews,removed,fakestnews
UpliftingNews,removed,its amazingly easy to google womens march mission and if you do there will be a page pull of information on the womens march website i did that exact thing when i thought wait why are women marching
UpliftingNews,removed,if nobody was arrested i guess that means litter laws arent being enforced or litter is legal in dc
UpliftingNews,removed,to be able to make more sandwiches
UpliftingNews,removed,imagine how much progress could have been made for their causes if they had all voted makes me smile inside
UpliftingNews,removed,still not sure i know what they a protesting for as far as equality goes how is there no equality between sexes
UpliftingNews,removed,many of those litterbugs were marching to protect the environment somehow
UpliftingNews,removed,most of them were out for solidarity meaning just following the herd
UpliftingNews,removed,year account with karma i bet youre awesome at parties
UpliftingNews,removed,hmmwomen minorities et al always marching for themselves not everybody they are always assuming and trying to penalize white men most white men have no control over issues affecting other groups self interest ahead of others is not a trait of good people delusional professional victimhood is not a good thing either burdening others with your consequences is theft where is the personal responsibility of these groups is nothing their fault at all
UpliftingNews,removed,shame should have punched some of the trumpets standing around
UpliftingNews,removed,thats the issue people like to protest and yell fuck this shit even when they dont know why or what they are rallying against
UpliftingNews,removed,they are mad hillary lost
UpliftingNews,removed,bunch of pussies
UpliftingNews,removed,her march was about as useful as her former occupation
UpliftingNews,removed,or the trash that was on the mall during the inauguration
UpliftingNews,removed,yes of course there was no police violence or arrests police tend to be more gentle with white women
UpliftingNews,removed,i still think this protest was quite dumb were these women protesting for the women in third world countries for the single mothers working jobs for the women with no rights or are they just protesting in a nation where women are equal to men and have the same opportunities
UpliftingNews,removed,and still pointless
UpliftingNews,removed,the most privileged group of people on the planet decide to protest for some reason and noone can figure out why
UpliftingNews,removed,a lonely old cat lady a feminist who could have guessed
UpliftingNews,removed,got a lot accomplished with this march i tell ya
UpliftingNews,removed,you do realize that these marches were organized by a woman who adamantly supports sharia law
UpliftingNews,removed,you didnt hear the potus can brag about sexual assault publicly call on a foreign entity to hack our government and ask his followers to assault critics being a dick is now called being presidential try to keep up
UpliftingNews,removed,i am fully aware that you carefully hedged your position when you posted that in no way make it okay you are on the internet to use reddit you could and should have very easily checked the info before posting instead of deliberately and i suspect intentionally muddying the water sticking to a well i did say maybe defense in later replies instead of editing your original post is just a spineless way of allowing the disinformation to continue my reply however was not to your comment but to the link which on the surface appears to supportconfirm your statement people who want to agree with you will see what they want to see he had the good grace to update his reply
UpliftingNews,removed,and without a well defined purpose eitherhaving a vagina is not an argument
UpliftingNews,removed,womens march is autism
UpliftingNews,removed,well thanks for confirming my original impression of you
UpliftingNews,removed,nobody fucking reads anymore huh everybody stops at the title and source
UpliftingNews,removed,its whiny liberals feeling like they are accomplishing something
UpliftingNews,removed,i was there yesterday i am a resident of the longville area it was a gathering of people unified in their desire to express their first amendment rights all signs were positive build bridges not walls love it was not whiny or a proabortion rally it was more of a quest to express desire that those who represent us in government do so by hearing all their constituents concerns by representing our country in a dignified and compassionate way by telling the truth and being transparent by uniting us and not dividing us there were men and women and young youngest years and old in their there were native americans and disabled and people from all walks of and stages of life teachers and social workers and business owners and retired professionals and grocery store clerks this is not an area full of people who are extreme in beliefs or actions in either direction it is an area full of friends and neighbors who deeply care about each other and that was the prevailing spirit yesterday and that is the prevailing spirit all the time i for one think that we all need more of this type of thing we all have so much more in common than differences and the only way to realize this is to gather and talk to each other face to face there is so much good in all people we just have to draw it out of each other

UpliftingNews,removed,so why arent we all dead million people is times more people than the us has in the military hell why havent there been hundreds of terror attacks in america after the orlando shooting clearly the fbi cant keep tabs on everyone they think is a threat there are million muslims in america using your bullshit percent radicalization number that means here are muslims in america ready to kill anyone who doesnt adhere to sharia law and there would be plenty of targets and plenty of ways to get your hands on firearms legally hell lets give you the benefit of the doubt and say that people who come to america are more prowestern so only percent of that percent are actually radical enough to kill someone thats people there havent been attacks by muslim terrorists in america since the its not even close about muslims committed terrorist attacks in since the and im approximating but there were foiled attacks so lets say people per foiled attack comes to plus equals muslim terrorists that committed an attack or were foiled from doing so thats not even close to you are so unbelievably mathematically full of shit get out of here with your hateful racist intellectually dishonest bullshit fearmongering and fuck off to stormfront actions speak louder than words if all the words radical muslims were hatefueled murder barbarians world society would collapse under the weight of a worldwide conflict that would make genghis khan look like a red cross operation youre talking hundreds of millions ready to do battle by any means necessary there are serious human rights concerns with a lot of muslim countries but by demonizing every single muslim as a hateful terroristinthemaking all you do is create distrust foster alienation and make recruitment by al qaeda and isis all the easier i mean jesus that was bin ladens whole plan commit a terrorist attack get america to attack muslims and reap the recruitment benefits and we walked right into it like fucking morons i bet youve never had a single muslim friend in your life if you had youd know that theyre just people people like us who want what we want to live our lives in peace and prosperity there are serious conversations education and outreach to be done about how some muslim countries treat women lgbt and religious minorities but turning them all into racist caricatures doesnt do any of that

UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,probably to be killed fuck those terrible people who want to hurt our fellow humans
UpliftingNews,removed,only ones side of the story because islam under any interpretation does not approve of lgbt lifestyles muslim who openly accept homosexual lifestyles can best be described as jack muslims who are fully westernized and would never be accepted as muslim if the central caliphate were ever reestablished because western democracy and culture is fundamentally incompatible with core islamic teaching many people dont realize that the caliphate was only brought down years ago during wwi and the vast majority of muslims would like it to be reestablished asap
UpliftingNews,removed,admiral ackbar might have something to say about this
UpliftingNews,removed,its a trap
UpliftingNews,removed,lol this is probably how it goes down in the countries practicing sharia since homosexuality is to be punished by death under basic islamic law round em up saying its an outreach effort and free dinner then throw them off the roofs

UpliftingNews,removed,when im thinking bad thoughts i like to read smart kid i noticed that just lately
UpliftingNews,removed,id keep the dog definitely wouldnt advertise i found him
UpliftingNews,removed,sure seems like a puff piece to promote police getting drones the article is obviously not about the woman that was lost
UpliftingNews,removed,have you have a semblance if a point but your attitude seems faulty
UpliftingNews,removed,the misguided souls who downvoted my joke i know doin good things is good
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont know i figure a girl whos a if shes got a good personality or better is pretty

UpliftingNews,removed,man i forget how racist reddit is then again the majority of the users here are young white males
UpliftingNews,removed,asians are odd i once objected to eating seahorses and they asked why i let them know seahorses would be extinct within thirty years due to the dry seahorse trade they seem to think that was a good reason to eat them before theyre all gone wtf
UpliftingNews,removed,neat
UpliftingNews,removed,you can tell its chinese by the eyes
UpliftingNews,removed,sensitive much
UpliftingNews,removed,yet we allow tens of thousands of refugees in from a place clinton de stabilized and we give them approx in benefits a piece while we let usa children fend for themselves hillary sucks
UpliftingNews,removed,this is not uplifting at all if he needs a service dog one should be provided by the healthcare system
UpliftingNews,removed,i am going to break the one rule because i am sick of negative nancies on this stupid fucking sub and to lay on top of that people who dont read the god damn article in april when aiden was about from his goal news coverage of his story helped bring in donations from across the us raising more than almost overnight literally states in the article he didnt have to pay out of his goddamn pocket maybe you need a service dog that can not only guide you but also help you read once in a god damn while ill gladly fork out a tenner for you to start it off
UpliftingNews,removed,seems pretty useless imo when i get an hypo the symptom are so easy to spot that i only check to be sure im going to die if you go low too often or keep your average sugar levels too low you get what i now have hypoglycemic unawareness basically the symptoms just stop since your body is used to it so i dont sweat anymore i dont shake i dont get dizzy my vision is fine etc i can literally not notice at all and think im functioning perfectly normally and then check my sugar and see im at or whatever so it can be very dangerous since the dangers are still there
UpliftingNews,removed,everyone on this thread needs to do some fing research most of you are dead wrong dont know what your talking about and are making people who do furious show some respect they can detect high and low blood sugars theyre trained to alert paw dig scratch at the owner as soon as they sense a change in the humans breath the second they sense the change which is usually faster than the human can feel it they alert omg like wait they have these meters though nah you dickholes how about when im sleeping and i wake up with a blood sugar or and i can barley move and im sitting in a pool of sweat while disoriented and passing out how about then should have felt it right yeah happens more times than you think its scary as shit and really not something id like to experience any more they are trained to alert based on treats meaning they like to work they love it my diabetic alert dog is getting trained as we speak i am using the same service this kid did hes months old and already times smarter than most people on this thread they alert to high and low theyre more than just a diabetes dog its for support as well seeing as managing the disease is pretty difficult having a companion in my every min of every day battle well thats pretty amazing im a year old diagnosed in is and i dont care what you think you know or what you think
UpliftingNews,removed,nope worthless little shits
UpliftingNews,removed,my costs still fundraising wwwmasonsdreamdogcom
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe they wont run away this time
UpliftingNews,removed,as a type the first year or so it was easy to detect when my sugar was low but now i can hardly tell and when youre sleeping is the really scary part ive come close to death times in my sleep its only a matter of time before it kills me a service dog would definitely increase my chances in living a longer and healthy life the dog is a must for many type but sadly they are very expensive i may be a luxury to you but for me i would give almost anything to have the reassurance and to not be scared being alone and know one finding me when i go into a coma i would be nice to not be scared to go to sleep and im only sadly i have to deal with this for the rest of my life i dont want your sympathy i just want you to understand what a service dog would mean to me
UpliftingNews,removed,according to the ada regulations there are absolutely no breed restrictions for diabetes alert dogs for training programs they tend to pick breeds that are known to have an acute sense of smell these breeds are golden retrievers labrador retrievers mixed sporting dog breeds and poodles sometimes smaller sporting dog breeds are trained for families who have a need for a smaller size dog these organizations select potential service dogs based on temperament trainability and superb scenting ability there are also programs that will allow any breeds of dog to enter the program as long as they meet all the requirements for the training and if a family has a dog they wish to train they can request a testing to determine if the dog has the temperament and scenting ability required to become a diabetes alert dog httpswwwthediabetescouncilcomdiabeticalertdogseverythingyouneedtoknowbreeds
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,my dog detected my friend was about to fit she went crazy whineing and pawing him seconds before had a grand mal seizure he had no history of fitting
UpliftingNews,removed,im an orthodox jew as well please dont say things that apply the actions of few and make it sound like the whole community does ie spitting on girls
UpliftingNews,removed,what
UpliftingNews,removed,the bird was promptly shot and removed
UpliftingNews,removed,in other news freddie gray gets no justice and murdererours police get away with it again
UpliftingNews,removed,and then they went on to shoot five blacks dove lives matter
UpliftingNews,removed,local teen given as hush money after elderly man touches him more at eleven
UpliftingNews,removed,honestly im surprised he didnt shoot it being innocent and doing nothing wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,i will never understand why people think god exists or is involved in something like this cant one person just be awesomely cool and caring to another person
UpliftingNews,removed,is there proof of straight as from his shitty school scholarships and a decent college ed would be much more valuable than just giving some kid on the street with anecdotes figures
UpliftingNews,removed,i gave to that other crowdfunding site the internal revenue service youre welcome
UpliftingNews,removed,to be born black so that doing a thing any decent person would do is seen as some magical proof of my goodness the times
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe someone should tell them to apply for food stamps ssi and various other social welfare benefits available to them instead of throwing money at the problem just to feel good
UpliftingNews,removed,that kid seems borderline retarded the money will be gone in a year and he will have nothing to show for it
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont ok good for her
UpliftingNews,removed,it would be interesting to see the response if she wasnt attractive
UpliftingNews,removed,so brave how are gays underrepresented at this point you hear about them doing something all the time arent they less than of the population
UpliftingNews,removed,im not saying she shouldnt compete because shes gay but shes so ugly if she wins its more american emotional pandering to anyone who feels different maybe im wrong and some people find her attractive but she looks like shes in her to me
UpliftingNews,removed,this isnt uplifting this is in the i dont give a shit section
UpliftingNews,removed,because we all know that straight women get totally excited when theyre in a room full of guys swinging brain right this tired bigoted stereotype of gay women needs to die already
UpliftingNews,removed,they need to remove these bus lines
UpliftingNews,removed,honeslty wtf i worked as a carryout for a local grocery store my job was literally to carry out groceries all day all i ever fucking made was minimum wage
UpliftingNews,removed,she looks like shes from missouri
UpliftingNews,removed,too bad she looks like shes
UpliftingNews,removed,aside from the lgbt thing isnt attractiveness part of the miss america contest she doesnt seem to fit in with the other contestants is there an lgbt affirmative action thing in beauty contests now
UpliftingNews,removed,unpopular opinion i hate this stuff every time someone is first to do something because of race gender etc it irks me not because of their race gender etc because its still such a problem that people are celebrating when it finally happens why havent we moved past this yet why is this still an issue makes me wonder if weve ever actually grown as a species
UpliftingNews,removed,what is it about people from missouri being flaming faggots
UpliftingNews,removed,excited to be first openly gay basket weaver excited to be first openly gay game show contestant excited to be first openly gay janitor excited to be first openly gay fast food server excited to be first openly gay plumber excited to be first openly gay train conductor excited to be first openly gay lumberjack excited to be first openly gay chess champion excited to be first openly gay glass blower god this shit is getting old get over yourselves already would ya
UpliftingNews,removed,im going to need video proof for verification because what if shes just saying that shes gay for media attention
UpliftingNews,removed,shes going to win because her special talent is eating pussy
UpliftingNews,removed,sexual orientation not being any part of my opinion of her my first reaction to the photo was thats the best missouri could do
UpliftingNews,removed,once you get past lgb everything else is pretty much a mental illness
UpliftingNews,removed,lol who cares
UpliftingNews,removed,if youre a woman your raised up if your a man youre knocked down if your gay your raised up if your straight your straight your neither raised up or knocked down if youre a mother youre raised up if your a father youre knocked down if youre white your knocked down if your a poc your raised up basically in the west if youre a straight white manfather your the most to be considered unneeding of support or empathy even if your been raped or are homeless nobody cares because of your privilege not convinced a petition to validate male rape victims and stop them being discriminated against by laws which refuse to acknowledge them as victims of rape received signatures whereas a petition to stop high heels from being enforced in the workplace got people care more about womens foot comfort than men who are raped equality is only for specific groups now im not denying that high heels are uncomfortable and i believe they shouldnt be enforced but its a matter or priorities male rape victims have a tiny amount of support compared to women laws are sexist and discriminatory perpetrators recieve less scorn as the word rape isnt used even if a boy was statutory raped by his teacher the word rape isnt used and she serves less time than a male rapist in that position so high heels should be an issue but bigger issues should take precedence
UpliftingNews,removed,yea not going to even take a stab at that but speaking of stab do you guys scissor
UpliftingNews,removed,the real issue is who cares what she chooses to do behind closed doors is her business shoving her agenda into everybodys face is just annoyingobnoxiousshould have her title stripped
UpliftingNews,removed,whats so exciting about being a mentally deranged twat who sucks on some other whores face just to get mens attention pathetic and stupid
UpliftingNews,removed,actually i have been told it was for hiv positive people
UpliftingNews,removed,this story didnt uplift me in any way shape or form
UpliftingNews,removed,this identification shit is getting out of hand why do you need a label for your sexuality no one else fucking cares what youre into sexually unless they want to fuck you so just explain it to them when they ask its not like people wont need an explanation for genderqueer anyway how many people were actually gender fluid before they heard of the concept some im sure but how many people heard about genderqueer and decided they would be that because it sounded unique quite a few more im certain im sick of people trying to define their sexuality and put it in a box and then telling you what their box is for their sexuality and then being upset that people only worry about their sexual orientation
UpliftingNews,removed,wow she is rather ugly must have given her the crown because of the gay thing
UpliftingNews,removed,cant wait for the first openly pedophilic whatever
UpliftingNews,removed,oh man the muslims are gonna hate this gay and unburrkaed double harram lol good for her
UpliftingNews,removed,ok im all for her being gay and its awesome that she made history but am i the only one who thinks she is straightup unattractive i mean thats the best missouri has to offer ill probably be downvotes for this but dayummmmmm
UpliftingNews,removed,wait you dont have to be a flaming faggot to be proud of your sexuality this changes everything
UpliftingNews,removed,why some mediocre girl like this become a miss something i see better looking girls pretty much everywhere ps dont want to be harsh and im sure she a fantastic girl but arent those beauty contests its like giving someone a math prize for their fantastic sense of humor
UpliftingNews,removed,pretty poor choice imo this will no doubt impact the local economy
UpliftingNews,removed,how stupid diamonds can be used to buy food and shelter tigers are murderous monsters who leave whole families weeping when they dive through the window to snatch an old person or child serious business tigers are a walking nightmare for anyone who lives anywhere near them or knows a goddamn thing about life on earth knows that there are few things in the real world worse than a tiger
UpliftingNews,removed,the cats love to kill people all of them always do your own research the rocks can be traded for food books whatever the tigers are lb murder machines fuck you first world retard let the kids die because you like stripy cats
UpliftingNews,removed,the cats love to kill people all of those diamonds in their own pockets
UpliftingNews,removed,giant pound beasts with razor sharp claws that will run out from the jungle in seconds grab you with one paw like you are a piece of paper and proceed to eat you for dinner or stimulate the economy
UpliftingNews,removed,diamonds are artificially scarce due to a few major companies stockpiling and hoarding them while diamonds have some industrial use the average person only cares about diamonds for jewelry and aesthetic reasons virtually only women so i dont give a fuck about diamonds
UpliftingNews,removed,the british swines stole all our pearls
UpliftingNews,removed,please say he was also super hot
UpliftingNews,removed,so she was there just watching her dog frantically swimming for over an hour
UpliftingNews,removed,mexican summer camp isnt that border crossing remedial
UpliftingNews,removed,how many days has it been since a catholic attack
UpliftingNews,removed,dogs anything else
UpliftingNews,removed,i think the dog was playing the long con was hoping for a good few meals
UpliftingNews,removed,the dog was probably waiting to eat him
UpliftingNews,removed,i know about other dogs that would just roll in deer shit and hightail after a squirl this dog list have been special with such skills the average dog is great no doubt but theyre dumb as dirt lol
UpliftingNews,removed,wait till he is dead and
UpliftingNews,removed,just another reason why dogs better than cats
UpliftingNews,removed,they mean like fine fine ya know a grade a panty dropper
UpliftingNews,removed,nice meme do u know any good ebaums world ones
UpliftingNews,removed,that wasnt even his human and he still did all that dogs are the best seriously think a cat is going to save a childs life like that psh
UpliftingNews,removed,if you put peanut butter on your balls and let your dog lick it off its not cheatingbecause its your dog
UpliftingNews,removed,idk but fuck cats
UpliftingNews,removed,reddit pet circlejerk like always
UpliftingNews,removed,eat your eyeballs asshole and genitals theyre a soft parts kind of animal with empathy lol
UpliftingNews,removed,allcatsmatter
UpliftingNews,removed,did he die in the hour
UpliftingNews,removed,did he eat the labrador
UpliftingNews,removed,mexican summer camp sounds like the kind of sex move you have to look up on urban dictionary i think it would be like a dutch oven but after you eat burritos
UpliftingNews,removed,reason why cats are obsolete because dogs
UpliftingNews,removed,plot twist he ate the dog
UpliftingNews,removed,if this was a cat it wouldve ate the damn kid after he dehydrated to death
UpliftingNews,removed,mexican summer camp sounds like a wrestling move
UpliftingNews,removed,alternate title hungry dog denied when meal refuses to die
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck that website
UpliftingNews,removed,dogs cats unconditional loyalty
UpliftingNews,removed,mexican summer camp that sounds terrible
UpliftingNews,removed,thank god you got rid of that annoying kid
UpliftingNews,removed,he was fine except for the fact that he was dead
UpliftingNews,removed,hes mexican of course he wouldve survived
UpliftingNews,removed,so dogs are smarter than teenagers in us of a
UpliftingNews,removed,guess what folx the wall just got feet higher
UpliftingNews,removed,i think he meant gringos
UpliftingNews,removed,we made them nigga
UpliftingNews,removed,plot twist he was just fattening up the hooman so he could eat him in a few weeks
UpliftingNews,removed,if reddit has taught me anything if it were a cat the boy would have been dead and the cat probably would have eaten his remains cats are assholes
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile where im from there was a story of an yearold woman who was stranded on a dirt path on her car with her cat she was there for days and the cat left her
UpliftingNews,removed,this is a story you will never hear about a cat and its owner dogs save lives cats check to see if youre still breathing at night and will eat you if youre not dogs cats
UpliftingNews,removed,look at methats my dog now mexican boy probably
UpliftingNews,removed,cry about it
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah the dog breastfed the kid hugged him at night and led him to find water he even hunted some rabbits for him and invented fire and cooked rabbits for the kid
UpliftingNews,removed,but do they actually appreciate you and are they loyal to you
UpliftingNews,removed,set that bitchnigga straight
UpliftingNews,removed,cats dont let him rub his penis in them and lick it
UpliftingNews,removed,at the risk of sounding a little bit racist the words mexican summer camp conjure up all kinds of images none of them good but a near death experience or three are definitely in there
UpliftingNews,removed,i like hows its phrased mexican summer camp and not summer camp in mexico as if this is some sort of special type of summer camp where you get lost in a ravine you know mexican summer camp
UpliftingNews,removed,dog was just waiting for kid to die so he cant eat him either that or dog knew its only chance for survival is to stay with the kid
UpliftingNews,removed,waiting for lunch to die
UpliftingNews,removed,plot twist he ate it
UpliftingNews,removed,good thing a cat didnt find him
UpliftingNews,removed,he was lucky he wasnt sent to migrant farm workers camp in florida
UpliftingNews,removed,kid has worst two days of his life goes through unimaginable trauma uplifting news
UpliftingNews,removed,build the wall higher
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean muslims taqiyya is what its all about just remember those whose are killed might not have been you but they were a real person with lives and loved ones trump
UpliftingNews,removed,taqiya
UpliftingNews,removed,you fell for it
UpliftingNews,removed,uninformed people should get to know the taqiyya integral part of islam that allows muslims to lie to the kuffar in order to pursue islamic agendas
UpliftingNews,removed,dailymail link downvote sorry but dailymail sucks ass
UpliftingNews,removed,sad so many young ignorant foolish socialist fall for this bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,for instance i hope for politicobotcom to become an important tool for exposing bot usage to influence elections i bought com even though i envision it to be open source venture
UpliftingNews,removed,i understand
UpliftingNews,removed,many places like amsterdam dont have legalized drugs perse but they do have decriminalized drug systems basically the difference is that possession of large amounts of take your pick here is still illegal but you cant be sent to prison or something for having a small amount i believe though i dont have data on hand that many of the countries that have done this have suffered no ill effects as a result thats also speaking of countries that dont have nearly as many people in prison for small drug crimes as the us so proportionally i would think that america would benefit even more if only in the drop of people being sent to prison
UpliftingNews,removed,theres already tons of children up for adoption or in foster care already and birth control in any form is not effective so youre saying if you use bc and still get pregnant tough luck if youre ignorant of birth control third world perhaps or birth control is inaccessible to you tough luck that to me seems like trying to punish women for having sex by taking away their last resort worse the people most likely not have access to birth control or that dont know how use it properly uneducated teenagers third world are typically the least suited to raise children so youre telling women that basically they cant have sex or at the least theres no such thing as safe sex for women because even if they dont want kids and try their best not to use bccontraceptives but that small statistical chance that they still get pregnant happens to them then theyre stuck with this child that they didnt want andor cannot care for having sex even with protection becomes a gamble with liferuining implications for women if elective abortion is illegal
UpliftingNews,removed,so then it has nothing to do with the murder aspect and more to do with women accepting consequences
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah because you know youre wrong as pointed out below
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this relevant
UpliftingNews,removed,i disagree with christians but you dont see me voting away their right to marry each other or advocating for letting people fire them or refuse to rent an apartment to them for being christians that is hate
UpliftingNews,removed,historically or so of all tv novel movie etc characters are straight considering of people are gay i dont think thats such a bad representation
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah you go gurl so brave mmm shove that gay pride down my throat
UpliftingNews,removed,when did she win gold
UpliftingNews,removed,what duz this have do star wars
UpliftingNews,removed,yeahgo talk to your invisible sky fairy im sure that will make it all better
UpliftingNews,removed,if you use the story of sodom gomorrah as a moral compass then you are an advocate for incest rape seriouslyhave you even read the bible you bigoted fucking moron
UpliftingNews,removed,last time i checked bigot you didnt get to dictate marriage for the rest of us so fuck off
UpliftingNews,removed,i didnt even know it was still on tv who said it was
UpliftingNews,removed,they look like lesbians
UpliftingNews,removed,holy shit glad my girlfriend is in the in the
UpliftingNews,removed,im so hard right now
UpliftingNews,removed,i always cringe at those who go to such great heights into pressuring someone on the spot in front of millions in the hopes of them feeling a submission into marriage shit like this should be disgracful not celebrated
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope trump changes that despite what the media would have us believe he is honestly one of the most moderate canidates policy wise the party has nominated imagine if ted had gotten it it wouldve been super christian time bible this and bible that
UpliftingNews,removed,good for them i love the lesbians they have great taste in music let me tell you
UpliftingNews,removed,til i need to get into womans ultimate frisbee and womens rugby the frisbee option sounds a bit safer
UpliftingNews,removed,are we gonna start lezzing out
UpliftingNews,removed,because straight proposals are boring and overplayed while gay ones are cute and new sarcasm
UpliftingNews,removed,that really sums it up marvellous
UpliftingNews,removed,so a couple gets engaged and this is news
UpliftingNews,removed,i just dont get how people think the gop have an ounce of fiscal integrity after reaganomics at this point fiscal conservativism is just an excuse to not defend or support the poor or vulnerable even when it economically makes sense
UpliftingNews,removed,geezereally
UpliftingNews,removed,there is a religious argument why torturing animals should be legal
UpliftingNews,removed,how sweet
UpliftingNews,removed,i believe it does not matter what you think or what others think of you what matters is what you do or say you can think whatever you want because no one can hear you there i think of murdering my son on a weekly basis but i wont ever do it saying it is a different matter altogether
UpliftingNews,removed,obviously its just so many people assume youre a lesbian when you mention you play rugby there was one team that fit the stereotype though
UpliftingNews,removed,i know reddit is known as a place where only the most intelligent go to discuss worldly matters sorry not everyones a humorless arrogant dullard like yourself btw what intelligent thought or brilliant insight did you add
UpliftingNews,removed,if this is your tipping point is it any wonder why wars meh rapes meh sexual deviance in church meh marriage proposals oh shit
UpliftingNews,removed,i think that lesson was not to be a salty bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,i was there yelling zica as well i didnt hear bicha and it doesnt even make sense to say bicha to a woman i dont want to say that we are completely innocent but this article is false although we are pretty homophobic and rude at football we yelled bicha to the iraquians players we bought this behavior from the mexicans for some reason
UpliftingNews,removed,haha thanks for making me look clever
UpliftingNews,removed,as well as the captain of the american womens team and before yall start in on your international fanfiction shes already married
UpliftingNews,removed,as a man who lived in a house with three female rugby players in college this joke was too real
UpliftingNews,removed,makes controversial statement laughs when people suggest controversial statement has no merit homie im as left as they come but my favorite thing about trump has been all the eyeopening readings ive done on true conservatism my grandfather would be proud somehow the worst politician in my life has shifted my political compass closer to his batshit views so because ive developed a total boner for reasoned factbased arguments for conservatism where is the fiscal argument against same sex marriage im all ears
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,exactly right
UpliftingNews,removed,virtue signaling

UpliftingNews,removed,he told you exactly why though unless you want him to give you an indepth analysis of hawaiian history cultural suppression and foreign rule its not too hard to do a quick google search and i believe he was pretty courteous in his response it seemed you over reacted more than anything else of course were going to have a laugh nothing funnier than an angry stranger on the internet
UpliftingNews,removed,at least they arent doing that stupid hawaiian war chant dance thats been trending lately

UpliftingNews,removed,this is exactly what i was thinking ive literally got family entering the marines this year and all i can think is they will be used as a tool in a corporate war someplace killing civilians and calling them insurgents when we know damn well we would be doing the same thing if a foreign army was occupying our country so annoying when actual heroics as displayed by this kid are somehow coopted by the military so they can appear human

UpliftingNews,removed,hope he realizes his wife would not do the same for him
UpliftingNews,removed,while thats nice and all im curious as to why theres not a push for the crowd to attend prom with people of their own age i would think feeling accepted and part of your own age crowd would be more of a morale booster
UpliftingNews,removed,stuck sounds an awful lot like sitting in the cab waiting to die in this article still good on hubby
UpliftingNews,removed,and they didnt stop to gang rape her good job guys
UpliftingNews,removed,you can tell this is not the usa because they did not shoot the pregnant woman
UpliftingNews,removed,oh you read the articld as well
UpliftingNews,removed,its not her job to do this stuff its your job to do this stuff believe it or not youre in the wrong from a biological perspective social norms and expectations fictional narratives of female protagonists etc have all warped your perspective to believe its her responsibility to understand this kind of common sense stuff if she has completed higher education you may further conflate things but understand this she is not you she does not think like you women do not think like men their brains are literally physically different and theyve been raised under much different conditions which leads to vastly different decision making heuristics yes women are capable of doing many of the same mental tasks and chores as men however in practice they often defer to men or expect men to take care of these problems and from their perspective this is the optimal decision as it leads to and always has led to a successful outcome im not saying you need to acquiesce her im saying you need to adjust your expectations because the ones layed out in your post are clearly misguided
UpliftingNews,removed,why even mention she wouldnt do the same for him how do you know while we cant know for certain the fact that she is female and he is a male adult means the probability of this occuring is much lower if her kids were in the car that would be a different story women just arent wired to heroically save grown men despite what you might read in fantasyscifi novels
UpliftingNews,removed,if you have a wife and make this statement you should definitely reevaluate your relationship well your expectations anyway we are talking about catastrophic life or death outlier situation that involves significant risk to self it is within the range of possibilities that she would attempt to save him just far less likely than he attempting to save her many men wouldnt save their wives or other men either hes already an outlier itd be foolish to think she would automatically return the favor
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe but its far more notable that he saved her and we naturally lean toward beliefs that give us positive feelings if you read her comments you can see she isnt focused on that
UpliftingNews,removed,the assumption is valid even with equal probability of rescue between the sexes if the chance that serious rescue attempt one involving significant risk to self is made by either sex is less than then the assumption that she would not return the favor is a reasonable one if you believe as i do that women are far less likely to rescue grown men than men are women the probability is reduced further and the assumption becomes more valid the fact that this is posted on this subreddit shows it is an outlier and not the most commonly chosen path this subreddit suffers selection bias for positive outcomes just as standard news does in a negative way pleasel lets not go down the rabbit hole of whether or not the conclusion logically follows the premise strictly based on statistical evidence thats far too much work the reality is people make assumptions based on the evidence they have yes these are subject to cognitive bias attribution errors etc but as we must move on with our day without being distracted by the actual evidential probabilities of outliers occuring we operating using simple heuristics that apply in most cases its completely reasonable to believe that she would not return the favor and i think ive outlined the reasons why this assumption is stronger than the alternative one i dont begrudge you for believing the opposite if you do i just think you are wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,i would bang the author of this article shes fucking hot

UpliftingNews,removed,lesbian relationships offer the highest amounts of domestic violence and one is an olympic rugby player
UpliftingNews,removed,its still ridiculous to do a public proposal i dont care if youre lesbian or not
UpliftingNews,removed,whats uplifting about this story people always get married so what
UpliftingNews,removed,no because they are lesbians so they are obviously corrupting our sacred institution of ideal family am i right s

UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder if the brazilians yelled bicha to them too
UpliftingNews,removed,theres a womens rugby team neat
UpliftingNews,removed,its not a lifestyle its a life just because a prejudice is traditional doesnt mean its not a prejudice so yes it automatically makes them a bigot
UpliftingNews,removed,she said yes what is this columbine
UpliftingNews,removed,lol nobody has to tolerate intolerance
UpliftingNews,removed,really thats the hill youre gonna fight your war on
UpliftingNews,removed,the point is that the fb friend thought it was a sweet sentiment until she found out the gender of one of them was the opposite of what she expected she has no idea what their lifestyle is and i reckon its quite different not because theyre gay but because theyre brazilian shes only hatin on the gay part in simpler terms calling a bigot a bigot is not bigoted
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet this pic will be in the next fappening round
UpliftingNews,removed,this is all well and good but i feel sorry for the guy whose girlfriend proposed to the soccer player
UpliftingNews,removed,lifestyle ahh the standby of homophobic bigots everywhere i dont hate you for the way you are i hate your for the choices you make the fact that i feel icky inside when i look at you is really your fault isnt it how am i a bad person for feeling grossed out by the fact that you exist cant you just keep it to yourselves
UpliftingNews,removed,because someone doesnt support the lifestyle doesnt automatically make them a bigot or idiot if it were only about not supporting the lifestyle that would be probably fine i dont support other peoples religious lifestyle either but these people are prone to actively sabotaging the right of other people to live their own lives as they please so theres that
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont care how much the media shoves homosexuality down our throats i dont care how much people get brainwashed by this there is this reality homosexuality will never be able to reproduce itself it does not work with evolution nor creation the traits of these two women can not be passed down to their offspring together
UpliftingNews,removed,its uplifting because they are homosexuals and it is news because we are all very good and righteous people here approve of me
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel like a idiot i had too look her up too see she wasnt a dude i was like how the fuck is a mens rugby player and
UpliftingNews,removed,im not racist i just dont support the lifestyle of a white person who marries a black person its not bigoted i just disagree with the lifestyle thats all this is what you sound like
UpliftingNews,removed,not very fair from here to propose after she got this post match burst of endorphin
UpliftingNews,removed,nothing like seeing two toned and athletic women making out

UpliftingNews,removed,yeah i know lesbians who marry are such idiots
UpliftingNews,removed,i love it how libtards will try to twist this into something admirable and rush to show their approval of homosexuality virtue signal much brazil is one of the last countries that still recognizes the supreme authority of the bible having a gay marriage proposal in brazil on national television would be like if christians came to a gay marriage ceremony and started protesting it but then again if libtards had any sense of respect they wouldnt libtards now would they
UpliftingNews,removed,im glad we accept people these days as they are to an extent but storys like this shadow some really heart full real ones thats going on in the world smh the one we really suppose to see and change our hearts and how we suppose to change the world our next generation are fucked

UpliftingNews,removed,faggots
UpliftingNews,removed,not gay not news
UpliftingNews,removed,it must never be referenced again
UpliftingNews,removed,that sounds fun but i dont think you have a clue what you are talking about being conservative isnt intrinsically evil however believing the sky cake gods talks to you is a recipe for disaster liberals are so lost right now its hilarious to watch you shit on christians at home because white but you have to support muslims because brown lulz liberals yell about womens rights but support the worst womens rights offenders in the world i bet that hurts to swallow doesnt it religion is for children and fools i dont judge them based on color or votes you are basically giving the country away because you cant offend someone nonwhite who breaks the law hilarious if i walk to canada i know im in the wrong why is it no one else seems to be self aware and i surely dont think i am entitled to anything they have just because i can walk politics is usually best when everyone meets in the middle or at least where ever common sense resides

UpliftingNews,removed,lmao so because gays cannot reproduce that means they wont be helping out society or how ever they worded it i forget please we could use less reproducing in todays society if anything think about it this way the example of the shooting at the nightclub in florida many were hospitalized now imagine if the partner of one of the victims wants to come and see how their loved one is doing if gay marriage was not allowed they wouldnt be allowed access to this information what if they have been living together for years i dont know how the laws work exactly in the states when it comes to this thats awful not being able to know how your partner is doing that alone is disgusting

UpliftingNews,removed,and were awarded the title of big boss
UpliftingNews,removed,could they not have found a less traumatising illustration picture than that
UpliftingNews,removed,that is depressing as fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,it should be noted that ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as i know that said in grade i took an sat test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area an iq test has shown me to be in the percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test my mothers boyfriend of years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of i understand physics better than him and i owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics hes not particularly successful as an engineer but ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it im also pretty good at engineering i dont have a degree and other than physics i dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy ive come across every question of existentialism which ive seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is psychology i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which i dont have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freuds theories im a good enough writer that im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the internet ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it i dont know if that will suffice as evidence that im intelligent im done with it though because id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii i would be against executing him in fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it id even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them i dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others i dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others but i dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them i dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc i know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things i love everyone even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone im pretty much a pacifist ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that the only time ill fight back is if the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and if i dont attack ill come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me i dont fight back ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that im never in a situation where ill be worse off after a fight if im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries i really dont care the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them id prefer to do that over killing them i consider myself a feminist i dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men and never participate in the old reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome that doesnt mean i look for places to victimize women i just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings ok when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that im kind of tired of citing these examples and im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far in closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the reddit brony community where i spend most of my time and where im pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so i guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments and uh im a pretty good moderator all that and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think now that you at least slightly know me
UpliftingNews,removed,but like couldnt they have an adult who wasnt looking towards the camera with tears in their eyes like they were pleading for someone to stop this injustice by calling a number to donate a specific amount of money

UpliftingNews,removed,nah you dont sound like an asshole you just sound completely ignorant like a fuckwit
UpliftingNews,removed,are you inherently stupid enough that you dont understand the difference between a fucking retard refusing to live a drain on society so great that he requires emergency treatment for refusing to accept lifesustaining liquid a normal functional human being contributing to society needing an ambulance for an emergent situation i may spend lots of time on reddit but i am one of those sorry
UpliftingNews,removed,hes a burden for the society
UpliftingNews,removed,thats a good life lesson learning to never adjust to even the smallest change nice
UpliftingNews,removed,once again you didnt bother reading what i wrote you merely made up your own mosthostilepossible concept for what you wish to imagine i said and bitched at me as if thats what i actually said i have no sympathy for you go read what i wrote again and maybe it will sink in
UpliftingNews,removed,obviously youre not a wheelchair bound invalid who would rather die than have a new cup nor are you animalistic enough to fucking throw things at your parents chill
UpliftingNews,removed,this just seems like a case of spoiling the child by sparing the rod this is not acceptable behaviour no matter how special snowflakeyautistic you are all that kid needs is a smack across the face
UpliftingNews,removed,things like this should be put down at birth a useless drain on society
UpliftingNews,removed,your persepective on autism is scewed thats why you think so my sister is hit with severe autism and when i read this i thought it was a nice thing and lucky for the parents if this is the worst they get with him all of a sudden we have to cater for the slightest inconvenience sorry for saying this but fuck you you can say that to fully functional people but it just shows you dont understand people with autism like all you know about it is people on has it he has autism but he is capable of acceptance and adjustment thats the deal my sister would accept and adjust to percent of stuff its the last percent that is so fucking hard to understand or know they will get caught up in the smallest stuff and it will take the longest time figuring it out and when one do its suddenly something else autism is hard to get unless you live with someone who has it and even harder if all you know of it is that it makes some people a bit weird meet or live with someone hit with severe autism and you can see this slightest inconvenience is a blessing to not be anything more than him wanting a similiar cup
UpliftingNews,removed,jesus christ what a waste of oxygen tat kid is and will forever beh the parents should just let him die with a full glass of water before him and then start over
UpliftingNews,removed,let that little fucker die

UpliftingNews,removed,i would a child with no chance to reproduce is just a leech this kid will never reproduce or be able to care for itself therefore it is invalid
UpliftingNews,removed,it still boggles my mind that people actually choose to keep disabled kids
UpliftingNews,removed,oh honey you want to go there bring it he should have never ever been allowed to have that cup this is a parenting and teacher issue but he has autism excuse is in the past i know because i am a head of autism spectrum disorders and behavior intervention

UpliftingNews,removed,such a humble guy biden who seeks to cultivate the image of a regular joe would take a helicopter designated as marine two from the vice presidents residence to joint base andrews in maryland at least once a week he then would hop on air force two to jet back to his home in delaware he would return to washington on air force two the cost of the flights is doubled because after dropping him off in delaware or going back to pick him up the air force has to fly the plane empty on socalled deadhead trips since the book came out in august biden has cut back on the costly trips often taking the train instead

UpliftingNews,removed,homeless people dont need houses they need mental health which a far more difficult problem to solve
UpliftingNews,removed,actually well house has been running this program in one way or another for years now the houses at least the original three started as being run down theyre quite beautiful now and serve as a community hub and meeting place they regularly open their doors to community building activities with their neighbors with a fair amount of success
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck your bureaucracy
UpliftingNews,removed,our local homeless non profit tried this they had a hard time finding people to take part in the program then they ate huge losses because the homeless people trashed the shit out of them they also generally told them to fuck off when they offered counseling and career help and sat around all day drinking their selves to death it will be interesting to see how this turns out if they revisit it in a few years
UpliftingNews,removed,i made another comment in this thread that said kind of the same i think one problem that had was they would flush random shit down the drain because they didnt want to take out trash then when that clogged up they would just shit and piss wherever or devote a room to it as sad as homelessness is its not always due to circumstance mental illness and some people just naturally being dicks no one wants to deal with seem fairly common
UpliftingNews,removed,theyll be destroyed in no time habitat for humanity cant even return to see a well maintained home a year after the fact
UpliftingNews,removed,ive been homeless the houses will likely all be uninhabitable in a year or two nice work guys

UpliftingNews,removed,its fantastic that he has been honored like this does anyone else feel like this is devaluing the whole concept of michelin stars though again i am not taking away from him being an expert at what he does but i thought that the whole point of the michelin guide was for really high end experience style restaurants not just good food from a street vendor
UpliftingNews,removed,except pretty much all of singapores cuisine and culture comes from malaysia
UpliftingNews,removed,the hawker feast priced at just over £ per portion is now the cheapest michelinstarred meal in the world i think its time to raise prices to £ per portion
UpliftingNews,removed,man i love seeing this literally times here on the front page in the last days

UpliftingNews,removed,i got a blank phone call from latvia the other day true story anyone recognize it
UpliftingNews,removed,psh the solution is easy raise prices to where the line reduces just enough hes going to kill himself trying to make this pace at that price its partly because he wont share his secret recipe with anyone which is understandable if he wants to do it himself he has to raise prices at this point its not about greed or princples the demand is simply too high for him to keep up with

UpliftingNews,removed,you know whats also pretty impressive i graduated high school when i was please clap
UpliftingNews,removed,i think its wonderful that this father loves his son enough to do this god i wish my parents had loved me enough to permanently disfigure themselves for some silly reason
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah because fun means being retarded enough to be persuaded over time that disfiguring yourself is normal behaviour in the event of a family member going through a serious illness i think for myself and you can suck my dick and lick my balls because im a fun guy and you are missing a prefrontal cortex
UpliftingNews,removed,bullshit no thats the idea he wants you to think the point was to be the guy who does this shit thats as far as this retard went with it he saw it done before and wanted a bit of that attention for himself he is insane needs help and all you fools supporting this behaviour are like vultures encouraging someone to mutilate their bodies in exchange for feels use your fucking brain
UpliftingNews,removed,like when you guys caught the boston bomber
UpliftingNews,removed,wow good job it sucks when people have no respect for nature reckon we could use that energy to stop this environmental vandalism next

UpliftingNews,removed,no one should respect anyone believing in a wizard in the sky
UpliftingNews,removed,you know what else would make them smile being put out of there misery
UpliftingNews,removed,meals on wheels
UpliftingNews,removed,probably another butthurt hillary fan
UpliftingNews,removed,reminds me of this
UpliftingNews,removed,finally here i didnt know this is what weve all been waiting for lol
UpliftingNews,removed,pretty in what world
UpliftingNews,removed,six year old sweatshop workers are really getting creative these days arent they
UpliftingNews,removed,nothings going to happen to planned parenthood you weirdos

UpliftingNews,removed,so hear me out this picture reminds me of the picture of the police dog being led to the vet for the last time and having a bunch of officers salute her i thought for sure that that this was a picture of a year old being led to the doctors to be put down im horrible
UpliftingNews,removed,oh ol dirty
UpliftingNews,removed,unfortunately things took a strange turn when she demanded the firemen disrobe and attempted to stuff one dollar bills into their trousers shouting lets see how you handle those hoses her family has explained that she is suffering from dementia and will be placed in a care facility next wednesday
UpliftingNews,removed,salute you miserable pieces of un dignified shit sound off like you got a pair i cant hear you you fucking pussy licking fedora wearing cunt now sound off again and this time act like you got some hair on your testicals m
UpliftingNews,removed,i did read and the second paragraph was taken from the wiki page in separate sentences everything that is listed on the wiki has them be considered active duty for the purposes of programs administered by the veterans administration in each wasp was awarded the world war ii victory medal those who served for more than one year were also awarded american theater ribbonamerican campaign medal for their service during the war in president barack obama and the united states congress awarded the wasp the congressional gold medal everything there was given to the members of the army marines and navy who qualified for those honors if theyve only missed the aspect of raising their hand and reciting the oath of enlistment is what makes them not be part of the army i have no issue overlooking that having given years to the army these women did the same job and gave the same amount of service to the nation that i did i dont care if the article thinks the army is sexist or not if they think the army is sexist they can go pound sand for all i care the issues of space at arlington is a valid issue the secretary of the army has to approve each burial in the ground while any remains can be placed on the grounds as inurnment
UpliftingNews,removed,i guess radio operators also deserve as much credit as front line troops right
UpliftingNews,removed,more than of the bombers were lost on some single missions done by the air force flying aircraft is difficult and dangerous under any circumstances but having the airplane overloaded with bombs and fuel and having others doing their dammdest to shoot you down is something else
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this uplifiting
UpliftingNews,removed,in my opinion the article makes a ridiculous claim that female pilots deserve the same recognition as make pilots i personally think this is absurd as females only served a non combat role and while they were serving they gave up nowhere near as much as males yes the tone is not uplifting because i think the claim is unreasonable and im tired of stupid male and female equality in todays day and age equating and serving by men in women in the military when almost all of the military casualties are male
UpliftingNews,removed,im pretty sure that there was plenty other training units around to train the men and that the wasp are not singlehandedly responsible for training all the pilots that fought in the war its nice and very useful that theres people around to support the frontline soldiers but since they do not put themselves on the line risk to be maimed or killed violently i really wouldnt consider that to deserve as much credit as the actual soldiers by the way why dont you go fuck yourself wussass little bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry i realize this is horribly irrelevant and perhaps uncalled for but there is something about a woman in a military uniform that is incredibly attractive
UpliftingNews,removed,this is the kind of equality feminists need to be fighting for not the other ridiculous nonsense they scream about
UpliftingNews,removed,wow this is amazing nyc must feel soooooo much better knowing an artist doodled some shit over pictures i ejaculated after viewing each one although unintentional me roommate appreciated it
UpliftingNews,removed,just press the save button then you idiot what else do you think that does
UpliftingNews,removed,helps that theres a pretty damn good ebt system in place but food stamps are bad and serve only to keep poor people lazy
UpliftingNews,removed,alexander cameltoe

UpliftingNews,removed,my dick is already out is it too soon to have dicks out
UpliftingNews,removed,alexander cameltoe
UpliftingNews,removed,harambe would be proud
UpliftingNews,removed,why did i read alexander cameltoe
UpliftingNews,removed,better than alexander cameltoe
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck this im unsubbing this sub has gone from actual uplifting news to shitty meme stories and bullshit like that

UpliftingNews,removed,david blaine has already scheduled a meeting with this kid i guarantee it
UpliftingNews,removed,why are you posting this old news you turd
UpliftingNews,removed,if i know anything about returns and i do there are going to be returns after the holidays
UpliftingNews,removed,muslims would have sent the to allah fuck da police
UpliftingNews,removed,duh infidels alluah akhbar
UpliftingNews,removed,what the fuck does it matter how it is spelt as long as it is understood isnt that what is important
UpliftingNews,removed,god i hope they didnt sell them to someone who loves the sweet juicy taste of dog meat
UpliftingNews,removed,cuteness overload
UpliftingNews,removed,gotta raise her piglets somewhere
UpliftingNews,removed,their dogs not human children theirs not doggy social workers you dumb fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,did that cow finally outgrow her pen
UpliftingNews,removed,i hate this woman
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean their minds werent changed by passing laws and talking down to them i dont think this will work regarding other differences in peoples thinking
UpliftingNews,removed,they stoned her after this became viral because women arent allow to play hockey in abu dhabi
UpliftingNews,removed,its almost like being friendly and not trying to shame people for what they believe is a better than talking about how theyre the scum of the earth and deserve to die a lot of progressives could learn a lot from this exchange
UpliftingNews,removed,i demand this transhomosogyphobe be banned from the internet
UpliftingNews,removed,did you even read his comment its like you were just waiting for someone to write anything so you could vomit out your comment if you want to expand on the original comment its literally if you want to end racism start with education and understanding instead of flaming on twitter and you got upset
UpliftingNews,removed,ehh as a black man im a little uncomfortable with the implication in articles like these and yes i know its the daily mail it implies that a viable and implementable solution to racism has black people putting themselves at risk to quietly and kindly convince hostile audiences that black people are worth listening to which can work but is not at all realistic see for example wherever the rgreatapes refugees are now i have no interest in doing this and admit it hip white liberals of reddit neither do you otherwise you would be all over this shit
UpliftingNews,removed,one can hate niggers and be friends with black people black person does not equal nigger
UpliftingNews,removed,reaching out is good unlike mtvs shame tactics p
UpliftingNews,removed,say that all you want this guy is actually making change instead of prattling some meaningless platitude
UpliftingNews,removed,i will happily become your friend
UpliftingNews,removed,notice that they entertain logic and reason enough and question their viewpoints this is the mark of intelligence and with it they will realize they dont in fact hate blacks because hate is pointless and unhealthy you dont hate your dog for being a dog but you put it in its place when it bites you because you are the master likewise whites do not hate blacks but put them in their place when they bite because they are a bit more masterful in the relationship by virtue of their slightly higher intellect in time neither blacks nor whites will hate each other but will accept our roles in nature and if readers of this post cannot do the first line in this paragraph they might be more mentally challenged than a racist and thats ok too
UpliftingNews,removed,anyone wanna try this on rthedonald
UpliftingNews,removed,as opposed to mtvs new years resolution for white guysnot even kkk white guys
UpliftingNews,removed,ill happily be a friend of progressives if they were actually progressive theyre exactly the same just hating a different group
UpliftingNews,removed,one would think members of the most racist organization in the united states would fit the bill what black lives matter
UpliftingNews,removed,funny thing is the same people who say what you say are complete hypocrites when it comes to islam every fucking time theres a thread about a jihadist these people come out and scream see islam is bad why arent regular muslims protesting and disavowing terrorists
UpliftingNews,removed,former kkk member im not a racist anymore i have friends who are black sjw only racists say they have black friends sorry i usually keep this type of shitposting to twitter but i couldnt resist thanks for posting this made me feel really good inside
UpliftingNews,removed,now if we could convince more blacks to behave like him good man
UpliftingNews,removed,go trump go
UpliftingNews,removed,how do you know the klan is irrelevant or is this one of those times when white folks get to decide how big a problem really is for everyone else
UpliftingNews,removed,so how do we convince sjw liberals that cis white males arent the devil
UpliftingNews,removed,because hip white liberals are usually the sort of people whod find this story uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,fat and hideous
UpliftingNews,removed,lol years ago im asking you to go talk to klansmen who are alive right now lol srsly years ago get the fuck out of here
UpliftingNews,removed,im totally interested in fixing the issue but am i expected to put myself in harms way to do so
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck how it comes off we are right racism is wrong sexism is wrong homophobia is wrong call it virtue signalling and political correctness and identity politics if it makes your bigoted ass feel better but you are wrong as fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,far more effective than the sjws who just scream and shout
UpliftingNews,removed,this is how you conduct positive change
UpliftingNews,removed,i know ive been using you as a general term in my posts as well so no foul but thats just it tho everyone wants to be vindictive against those they see as bad but that works maybe of the time just because you think theyre terrible people and preach terrible stuff doesnt mean to lash out at them and call them scum youre literally just reinforcing what they already believe you have to get them to see that what they believe is wrong by being nice even when they arent sure if they attack you or hurt you get them arrested but most people on here have never and will never experience that using udrunkatchurch as an example theyre just wildly spouting death to bigots well guess what threatening death doesnt really tend to bring people over to your side and pushes away moderates you want to win support dont play into what they already believe you wont change everyone but will change enough
UpliftingNews,removed,everybody walks their own unique spiritual path to enlightenment 🌟✨🌟
UpliftingNews,removed,but at the same time supports the blm terrorist group
UpliftingNews,removed,im in the kkk and have many black friendsi just acknowledge the fact that race is intertwined with culture percent not percent of blacks glorify violence and being victimized that culture is destroying our country if you are a black guy and you do not associate with that culture the klan has no problem with you
UpliftingNews,removed,turns out some people really are stereotypes he says while eating fried chicken with hot sauce he then proceeds to smoke crack he bought with welfare money neighbors lament seriously that guy literally does nothing all day but he gets it in his head to represent us this is going to take decades to undo
UpliftingNews,removed,you didnt even realize what i wrote man this guy is putting himself at risk of physical harm to solve a problem he didnt create and is in no way responsible for which is great and noble but not fucking viable it continues a long tradition of only recognizing black folks when they put their literal lives on the line simply to be treated fairly so quit your equivocating hypocrisy the world isnt perfect is the best copout of all sure its not perfect but that doesnt mean i need to risk my life talking to klansmen either if you think thats a reasonable thing to ask black people to do then try it sometime
UpliftingNews,removed,now if there was only a white man who could do this with blm
UpliftingNews,removed,i know debates are a hard concept for children but please try to at least contribute at least a little bit to the discussion
UpliftingNews,removed,we elected barack obama and other moderate black leaders around the country lol murderous destructive behavior of blm please be specific sir or gtfo
UpliftingNews,removed,would be nicer if he could convince some of his brothers and sisters to stop burning down cities and shooting cops
UpliftingNews,removed,the rape victims shouldve listened to their rapist about how horny their outfit makes them as a male computer engineer i love logic it makes sense that a revealing outfit would make a man sexually aroused it doesnt make sense to ask a man to change his genetics hahaha
UpliftingNews,removed,that sad motherfucker misconstrues my argument and im supposed to attempt to understand him why why didnt he read critically or do i have to do that for yall white folks too preclearance basic arguments so you dont get annoyed triggered and turned off pfft fuck that
UpliftingNews,removed,stanley
UpliftingNews,removed,i know im way too late to this but i know this guy so youre a ex klan member
UpliftingNews,removed,trouble is its the black racists that are actually committing the crimes
UpliftingNews,removed,these hate groups dont hate one specific person they hate groups of people based on stereotypes and how they are viewed politically
UpliftingNews,removed,hopefully he accomplished this without burning and looting their neighborhoods lol
UpliftingNews,removed,so aside from vague and fuzzy platitudes about how the world is and ought to be and admitting that life risking for decency is not a reasonable or fair thing to ask read the article again and try to see how dangerous that kind of thinking is to other black people who may try this approach is it still uplifting and what would you do if youre really talking about the world that is
UpliftingNews,removed,show me who they are for they are also my people
UpliftingNews,removed,we both know youre just trolling for responses if you actually wanted to be friends youd actually contribute now i ask again do you want to be friends
UpliftingNews,removed,hatred hell yeah i hate niggers dunecoons gooks spice and white trash why love people that treat everyone else like shit and only think about themselves and who they can rob steal from or generally fuck over
UpliftingNews,removed,sure he should be congratulated im asking you to recognize how dangerous this kind of thinking is though and how unsustainable it is in the long term or put another way if it really is positive would you do it equivocating no btw
UpliftingNews,removed,killing hatred with kindness christian has convinced islamists to abandon the caliphate by making friends with wait no they beheaded the christian sorry experiment failed
UpliftingNews,removed,and instead they cause death unsurprising from a racist violent black supremacist movement
UpliftingNews,removed,now do the same with blacks in the ghetto to stop killing each other
UpliftingNews,removed,thats kinda what i am trying to do on reddit convert all you hippie neck beards to the church of the alpha male
UpliftingNews,removed,i want you to admit this is dangerous and at some level troubling thats all
UpliftingNews,removed,do we not destroy our enemies by making them friends thats no reason to convert to islam
UpliftingNews,removed,liberals need to do start doing this its not good to hate someone just because he doesnt believe the same things as you these sjw pc morons are as bad as these klan members who hate someone just because of the color of their skin
UpliftingNews,removed,burden is on black people to prove why white people shouldnt be racist no the burden is on blacks to stop being violent animals of the population committing over half of all murders and robberies and over of all rapes and burglaries being racist is the response to having to deal with people who simply cant fit into society
UpliftingNews,removed,it was too long no
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,lolololololol they werent very dedicated kkk members fuck dis nikker
UpliftingNews,removed,love it this guy learns from ghandi and mlk instead of black lives matter
UpliftingNews,removed,lol whered you get this one the last one i saw was a split is there a rule it has to add up to
UpliftingNews,removed,lol did you even read my posts of course not i literally argued that more people should be like the black dude in the article
UpliftingNews,removed,my reaction to this is counterproductive and its productive to promote the idea that black people can help by literally risking their lives lololol
UpliftingNews,removed,because i wont do your work for you sorry massa suh
UpliftingNews,removed,because i wont do your work for you sorry massa suh
UpliftingNews,removed,its fine if you didnt think it provides value but others disagree so
UpliftingNews,removed,white people has it as bad as other minorities feel bad for us too is what this comment look like delete this mod this is a pathetic
UpliftingNews,removed,who the hell stickied this hey this post is a reminder of real racism let me just blurt out how victimized i feel cause im white and tumblr exists
UpliftingNews,removed,triggered why dont you run to your safe space lol
UpliftingNews,removed,so black people have to do it or is it up to all of us where the fuck were you when darryl was reaching out to klansmen probably dicking around on destiny or whining about no mans sky lol get off your high horse you sad little middle class punk
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this comment stickied its not uplifting at all keep your political bullshit out of here
UpliftingNews,removed,this comment is really tone deaf imo
UpliftingNews,removed,im so proud to see that the mods of this sub are redpilled and reject cultural marxism and other garbage liberal ideas
UpliftingNews,removed,people who arent white will have a different answer for you than people who are white and you cant tell who is who on here so this probably isnt the best place to get that question answered
UpliftingNews,removed,where does it say that i just see the bjs website
UpliftingNews,removed,if you have no experience with them then how do you know theyre not relevant cause i have quite a bit and i can tell you theyre very relevant
UpliftingNews,removed,im usually agitating at klan rallies though how come theyre never there
UpliftingNews,removed,this is an unusually controversial and completely unprompted comment to see from a mod of this sub
UpliftingNews,removed,okay but to make an analogy a post about jewish people and exnazis getting along today would be great material for rupliftingnews whereas a mod sticky on the top of the comments section about dont forget nazis gassed the jews and performed horrible experiments on them heres some pictures would not be appropriate
UpliftingNews,removed,til the mod for rupliftingnews is a complete cunt s
UpliftingNews,removed,this subreddit is meant to be a place free of excessive cynicism negativity and bitterness someone posts a picture about puppies getting along with inmates mod sticky post dont forget that some criminals like to beat up dogs and raise them for dog fighting rings heres a video rupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,removed,that says arrests man people get arrested for shit they dont do all the time and even so that says the number is percentish so really lol where im on pins and needles now
UpliftingNews,removed,an escape from the controversial fearmongering depressing news that is riddled with sensationalism a place free of excessive cynicism negativity and bitterness so if i post an article about refugees getting accepted by their new country to rupliftingnews am i gonna have to deal with a mod sticky post with a link to a video of a terrorist attack
UpliftingNews,removed,have you ever met any ever protested them or their ideology then how do you know anything about them
UpliftingNews,removed,hate surrenders with a whimper not a bang good job
UpliftingNews,removed,nice
UpliftingNews,removed,hot political take from the mod in this sub of all subs a little disappointingnice to see white fragility is as present as ever this really shouldnt offend you or anyother white person i sure as hell know it doesnt offend me why take an article so great and unifying and then add a toxic comment like that seems to undermine the the message
UpliftingNews,removed,you go fucking prove it he aint your bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,anything that dares acknowledges the fact that white people arent perfect is racist wah
UpliftingNews,removed,now if only the black supremacists and sjws could follow suit and stop calling for genocide on white cismen
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck you and fuck this subreddit not only did you miss the entire point of that video but you are using this subreddit as your own personal platform and violating your own rules how the fuck is linking a video you dont like for racial reasons uplifting news and then stickiing it youve got some agenda
UpliftingNews,removed,and liberals still think that racism against minorities is a noteworthy problem stay obedient to your globalist masters little sheep
UpliftingNews,removed,white people suck lmao
UpliftingNews,removed,that you dont know the difference is troubling dont distract from this mans noble work to mask your shameignorance
UpliftingNews,removed,thats it im done with this sub its always been garbage literally every thread is full of hate but this just goes too far for starters we have a link to the daily mail which is not even a newspaper its a garbage rag second we have a mod stickying his own pet bullshit for no apparent reason this is extremely irresponsible mod behaviour unsubscribed
UpliftingNews,removed,kek this one kek kek kek kek
UpliftingNews,removed,he banned my other account for racism when i called him out on using this sub for his own agenda and breaking his own rules fun times
UpliftingNews,removed,im pretty sure youre just a racist
UpliftingNews,removed,this is a test
UpliftingNews,removed,logged in just to say fuck you hypocrite in the downlifting spirit of your lame ass comment ban me pussy
UpliftingNews,removed,racists dont care if they are called racist hahahahahahahahahaha
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,someone more effective than all the blm protestors world wide
UpliftingNews,removed,lol youre all sixty percent of murders are by black people your site says percent of arrests they din do nuffin lololol omg white folks are incredible this one cant even read and im the drain on society
UpliftingNews,removed,oh sorry massa suh ill be sure to be less uppity in da future suh fuck off you sad motherfucker
UpliftingNews,removed,thats great now break up black lives matters with kindness theres racism in every country any color any religion its terrible
UpliftingNews,removed,oh no a white guy who knows what real racism looks like tell me more
UpliftingNews,removed,mtv isnt racist you are stop promoting your political agenda if people wanted to read more altright crap theyd be at rthedonald
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah but lets just ignore the nigger fuckers that commit most of the crime in the united states great fucking jobs you fucks its a good thing trump is here to fuck your liberal tears maga bitches
UpliftingNews,removed,an asian guy who knows what real racism looks like see above
UpliftingNews,removed,unsubscribed fuck off
UpliftingNews,removed,youre right and this is where blm gets their strategy wrong rather than pitting themselves against those who perpetuate racism they need to reach out and build relationships it can be counterintuitive especially if youre understandably angry about how your community is being treated and targeted but it works better than creating conflict
UpliftingNews,removed,bigotry is not racism
UpliftingNews,removed,oh look its you one of the resident white supremacists over at rthedonald
UpliftingNews,removed,the mod is a white supremacist
UpliftingNews,removed,ten years ago i would have laughed at the idea that antiwhite racism could ruin a century of progress in race relations in my country now ive actually watched friends and family go full white nationalist in response to this kind of nonsense its toxic and needs to be called out before any more people feel the need to take sides when someone steals equipment it took you years of saving up collecting and careful maintenance you might become racist too when you live in every major region of the us and are threatened every time by minority gangs you might become racist too when youre not able to be comfortable giving your wife an apple watch because minorities justify crime against whites using history you might become racist too and it might be justified because that white guy is a lot less likely to pull a gun on me mug me and then shoot me anyway even though i comply
UpliftingNews,removed,lol yet liberal people whining the way youre whining are the most common people and i am a liberal just not a peacocking narcissist

UpliftingNews,removed,using racial epitaphs in an aggressive manner can be charged as racially motivated assault which is categorized as a hate crime first of all an epithet not epitaphs unless youre talking about statements at a funeral and second and nary a citation was to be found

UpliftingNews,removed,dumbfuck
UpliftingNews,removed,no kidding of all the massive issues this sub has come across its a good thing the mod took the one chance to stand on a soapbox to bitch about racism against white people from a video on mtv one day the oppression from the network that has plague us for decades will end
UpliftingNews,removed,notice how they used the generic mod account and not their own personal account ridiculous that this sub has stooped to this level this is supposed to be uplifting news not rmodshaveaplacetocomplain

UpliftingNews,removed,we dont want their blood its low quality incest blood
UpliftingNews,removed,no he is not hes giving a false impression ahmadiyyas were somehow hated other muslims because they do good deeds this is the same kind of bullshit that makes people think al qaeda attacked america because they hate americas freedom instead of a complicated sociopolitical mess america got itself involved in the middle east
UpliftingNews,removed,considered as heretical by every other muslim sects who believe that mohammad is the last prophet no ifs and buts ive already addressed it it doesnt matter what the ahmadis belief in when orthodox islam rejects them

UpliftingNews,removed,nope tell me whats good about human sacrifice or leaving your family for your faith whats good about homosexuality being a sin maybe my arguments do turn up in atheist forums thats because atheists dont need to change their arguments religious people constantly have to try and justify or excuse the horrific teachings of their religion i would encourage you to seek out writings by sam harris or christopher hitchens

UpliftingNews,removed,youre trying to claim that only women should be allowed to raise children at an early age that devalues both men and women on top of that it proves that youre a moron
UpliftingNews,removed,it is but apologizing afterwards is sort of hollow like alan greenspan thanks for telling your worldview was corrupted and awful after you opened pandoras box and birthed misery into the world
UpliftingNews,removed,i will make sure to always do it to make it most likely that a panicked crowd will trample you or your family or your loved ones to death

UpliftingNews,removed,defining roles to a gender is how youre devaluing them jesus christ how are you this inept
UpliftingNews,removed,uh no not a small portion believes that in fact in my experience most american christians believe that anyone unsaved will go to hell when they die but at the same time of us adults also believe in hell — a place where people who have led bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished that doesnt count only christians thats just americans in general of american protestant christians believe in hell and slightly less catholics do poll most american christians and youll almost assuredley get a majority that believe homosexuality is an affront to god

UpliftingNews,removed,ok i saw this this morning this is a great story and im not attempting to deminish it but something about it does not make much sense to me reneita took each one of the kids from the bus one by one but also went into the empty bus again to check if everyone was out while it was still burning why did she take them off one by one were the kids so young they couldnt get off the bus by themselves i cant think of a reason why i as a bus driver wouldnt tell all the kids to get off the bus then do a final pass through and make sure everyone was out it seems that having them all wait while the bus continues to be engulfed in flames for me to run on and off the bus escorting the kids off one by one would be just not the most effective way and in fact even more dangerous way to do this again this was a great thing and good on her for getting them all to safety but it just doesnt make any sense to me unless of course the kids did not have the capacity to get themselves off the bus
UpliftingNews,removed,not saying that you are unattractive but it could just be that none of them found you attractive enough to risk the consequences

UpliftingNews,removed,no we cant because the palestinians land is still being colonized they are fucked and no amount of feelgood stories are going to change that
UpliftingNews,removed,checks comment history my god nice shilling
UpliftingNews,removed,the trick is to gas all the extremist jew or muslims gas them all and then you have no problems anymore but you cant just gas people of course you can
UpliftingNews,removed,typical jew

UpliftingNews,removed,dude captain raviv is hot what is it with israeli girls and where can i meet one
UpliftingNews,removed,both sides of any conflict have done wrong the question is who has done more wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,glad to hear most palestinians are not terrorists ill bet most israelis are not genocidal maniacs too
UpliftingNews,removed,if the gaza strip wasnt such a piece of shit with generally piece of shit people the locations of where these people came from from both sides wouldnt need to have been mentioned glad there were some good people doing good things in that place and time
UpliftingNews,removed,capt raviv got a phone
UpliftingNews,removed,yeh dead right if israel lifted its illegal blockade stopped bombing the gaza strip every few years stop illegally building on palestinian land and stop bulldozing un provided homes in palestine im sure that would probably solve of the issues there theyre not terrorists at all this label was thrown round back when irish people were fighting for basic human rights too not that long ago
UpliftingNews,removed,damn cpt ravi is hot
UpliftingNews,removed,each country instead of having a cabinet or the secretary of education or the minister of war or something like that each country should have a secretary or a minister of understanding not a propaganda person who is a press secretary but a minister or a secretary of understanding that actually makes an issue understandable so that any person in the public can explain it to a literate twelveyearold they actually make public information public available understandable and free none of those things are done anywhere in the world
UpliftingNews,removed,it just sucks that theres a disturbing amount of maga hat wearing idiots who truly believe palestine doesnt exist i literally have friends from palestine

UpliftingNews,removed,why do indian women always look like they just smelled a fart
UpliftingNews,removed,did he also install toilets
UpliftingNews,removed,so only engineers can assemble toys
UpliftingNews,removed,christians are such bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,religion is all of humanitys problem
UpliftingNews,removed,huh so christians use a primitive book to condemn homosexuals and you think youre righteous because you dont follow that particular scripture im sure hitler had some good ideas but you wont ever catching me quoting from mien kampf no matter how reasonable it might sound your good book is an unscientific inhumane rule book written by sand dwellers drop your religion and just let people be whomever they think they are
UpliftingNews,removed,at this point with all the money the families will be getting they are probably kinda glad they lost someone to the orlando shooting
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont think you even know what youre saying anymore youre far too stupid for your own good please end your life for the good of society
UpliftingNews,removed,we killed of you guys but well fix your windows
UpliftingNews,removed,reddit has made me wary of all submissions related to religion good or bad because i admire the efforts of these individuals i know that the majority of christians are kind considerate sympathetic people but i also know that op is a muslimhating trump supporter and the impetus for this post is to show what great people all christians are by extension when there are plenty of examples to the contrary while op is happy to damn an entire religion for the actions of a radicalized few so these christians get my sincere appreciation as should any person who shows kindness regardless of their religion or beliefs op gets a downvote for his attempt at manipulation
UpliftingNews,removed,so youre saying that a person who experiences a life changing event being redeemed from everything theyve done wrong and the supernatural consequences that come with them someone who knows love like no other love a love that has changed the whole way they live their life shouldnt mention it to other people how in the world could we not plenty of people of nonheterosexuality have become christians and changed some have become heterosexual others have taken to a life of abstinence all because there is something so much bigger than their sexuality during a finite lifetime and for the record there are other traits as ingrained in a person as sexuality they are just as sinful the bible condemns them the same amount as homosexuality and people are called to put those behind them just as much as any other sin homosexuality isnt some special sneauwflaque of a sin and christians havent been picking on homosexuals in particular as of late secular society brought it to the forefront of conversation first and we responded
UpliftingNews,removed,what a complete load of horse shit go to ratheism and you will find most are very happy to tell you every other religion is just as silly as christianitythe simple fact is that most atheists who care enough about not believing in gods to talk about it online do it because of a negative impact religion has had on their lives and for the mostly western population of reddit take a wild guess as to which religion that was i dont think much of islam at all but i can say that they are not the ones putting millions of dollars into lobbying efforts against lgbt rights abortion rights and restricting the rights of church rape victims to sue not in my area anyway
UpliftingNews,removed,your activity in rthedonald says otherwise but carry on trooper
UpliftingNews,removed,keep pushing an agenda
UpliftingNews,removed,link doesnt work i would refute what you are reading by saying that you need to look at the verses in question alongside the other cultures of the ancient world in a time when the norm was to kill anyone who disagreed with you and sacrifice your children to ensure your crops would be blessed god told his people to have a town for the accused to flee to and be safe and to value their offspring he also provided for a very rudimentary due process deuteronomy rules for prevention of spread of disease see leviticus very scientific before germ theory told them to love the foreigner among them as themselves leviticus enslavement of defeated enemies was the norm all in all i would say that god was very tolerant also dont forget that the bible is a historical record not everything in there was directly condoned by god it was just recorded for historys sake
UpliftingNews,removed,and pedophiles can donate to childrens charities it still dose not make it better leviticus if a man lies with a male as with a woman both of them have committed an abomination they shall surely be put to death their blood is upon them if christians want to make things better renounce the bible and god okay im ready for my ban
UpliftingNews,removed,yes you love them and want to limit their rights makes so much sense
UpliftingNews,removed,homosexuality is disgusting and pathetic i doubt men were born to fuck other men in the ass and suck dick kill yourself queer praise the pulse attack over abominations deserve it
UpliftingNews,removed,oh fuck off
UpliftingNews,removed,leviticus king james version if a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman both of them have committed an abomination they shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them
UpliftingNews,removed,leviticus king james version if a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman both of them have committed an abomination they shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them
UpliftingNews,removed,no safe spaces are for lazy cowards like yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,and they are black which makes it more rare
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck marry kill
UpliftingNews,removed,fill in those while you are at it
UpliftingNews,removed,lets try again you are the one devaluing them because youre saying traditional masculinity and femininity are bad somehow not even remotely but you locking them into those traditional positions is what devalues them by me stating that either can do each job does not devalue anything lets try again you are the one devaluing them because youre saying traditional masculinity and femininity are bad somehow lol what also you really dont make yourself look good telling people to kill themselves because they hold a different opinion to you thats admitting im so childish and intolerant that i cant stand anyone being different to me i pity you no you dont need to end your life because you hold a different opinion than my own you need to end your life because youre incredibly stupid and you should not be allowed to plague society any longer without you retarding our progress im sure we could have found a cure for cancer by now
UpliftingNews,removed,solidarity dude was in a car crash we protesting car crashes now
UpliftingNews,removed,fictional character jesus i come not to abolish the law but to fulfill it
UpliftingNews,removed,he was probably drunk driving and caused the accident killing a family but at least he gets to graduate
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,and his name is jonh coma doot do do dooo doot do doo doo
UpliftingNews,removed,we laugh when we see stupid useless news in media like this morning which said on usatoday why these millenials are going braless this is the reddit equivalent of that on fp
UpliftingNews,removed,stalin said hed rather see a thousand innocent men in prison than to see one guilty man go free
UpliftingNews,removed,this woman should now be serving the sentence this guy did
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe a sentence not as harsh but there should be a minimum for potentially destroying someones life and in some cases the court of public opinion will hurt the guys prospects even those accused can be looked at negatively even if its not true because the instinct for many people is to believe the woman because who would lie about being raped this is bad all around because it hurts real victims too i dont know if ive just noticed it more or if there really is some rise in false rape accusations but it seems like people are shifting away from blind empathy for victims without seeing some facts
UpliftingNews,removed,she should serve years
UpliftingNews,removed,actually rape has an extremely low conviction rate because even physical evidence of sex isnt always physical evidence of assault this country does however have a long and specific history of rail roading black men accused the biggest difference overtime is that these people make it to a trial alive
UpliftingNews,removed,this couldve happened to any white guy being accused of rape is almost automatically a guilty sentencing just because you are a male accused of raping a woman its her word against hers and she almost always wins it gets even worse when it happens in places like college campuses where this isnt any due process and they automatically side with the woman
UpliftingNews,removed,hard to say the system isnt against you when stuff like this occurs jarrett told the aba journal in last years feature that he had become such an effective jailhouse lawyer helping other inmates in prison that he was deemed a security threat and moved from a maximum security prison in wisconsin to a supermax facility where privileges were more limited
UpliftingNews,removed,we already know that falserape accusations make up the same percentage as other false allegations around it has been studied to death so i mean its an interesting idea but it doesnt hold up well to the mountains of research
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this accurate when we have absolutely no idea how many people are in prison for false rape allegations same as every other crime rape is not the only crime people are falsely accused of this is not a new problem the studies you have read would have put those innocent prisoners in the guilty bucket if it werent for the innocence project therefore the studies are completely unreliable this is not a new idea i know you are super political about this topic but take a moment or two to think it through people are falsely accused of many many things we have been developing ways to track these numbers for a long time for pretty much every crime the people doing these studies already know about the innocence project its a part of the data you are also not the first person to come up with the idea of known unknowns id like to know how not you want to know why a selfselecting population which is then reduced to only positive results is not a random sample really again how not the innocence project has been around years or more for a linear growth you would need investigation and conviction process as well as the cultural beliefs of the resulting juries to remain the same as well as constantly growing number of overall arrests for rape that is the only way to maintain a linear growth
UpliftingNews,removed,gee i wonder what happened to the person that falesly accused him or the people that falesly accuse every day
UpliftingNews,removed,fight back against the racist system fight back against false accusations good for him
UpliftingNews,removed,now hes jaydam to the ae because his defense is wire guided to the beat now i say everyday say a ohhh aaoohh i say boom boom boom everybody a ohh ya its me jay to the double d bring down the house yo its me i rickity rhyme i spend all my time dropping those lyricals in the da court house they know that im tyrannicle and im rocky marcianico so what the fuck yo whatyou doin in the penthouse sitting with you legs crossed dressed to thrill to get up on the way out spotted on the oh they threw my ass down but i did the time innocent as charged rape was the card didnt know the ho but that didnt stop the po slam thats a shame tho i learnt my rhyme tho a to mother z now the lawyers aint stumping me now so if you got dimed on instagram dayuuum and didnt do the crime call j to the double d jdam a wired guided j dam but why i got stop there man i strap pencils lentils for lunch and legal briefs for brunch i g the block round the clock my defense is impregnable im aleksandr tyson the great cut from the same cloth i weave and bob my questions are the bomb my cross exam hits the mark the prosecution rests kod like the mayo spread bitch call me if the police done fucked you up yo jarrett adams esq
UpliftingNews,removed,he found justice hope justice finds the victim as well
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe he can help to slowly fix the guilty until proven innocent mentality people have when it comes to rape people that act that way are disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,donald trump could use this guy as an inspirational story for what people can do with the closing line if life gives you lemons you make lemonade
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre not drawing cases out of a hat to work on its absolutely not even remotely random perhaps theyre prioritizing rape cases perhaps its easier to exonerate someone falsely accused of rape than other crimes perhaps the people falsely accused of rape are better at advocating for themselves and getting the attention of people who can help them just because we dont know exactly why it isnt random doesnt mean it isnt random its a group of people doing some research on cases theyre contacted about and then choosing when to help
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah and all those women complaining about sexual harassment pshh dont they know some people out there get raped and never say a thing or all those people complaining about taxes while in some places people just get outright robbed and especially those people complaining about other people online dont you know there are people in north korea who arent even allowed to have any individuality
UpliftingNews,removed,im so glad he didnt go around saying u made muh ancestors pick cotton now im stuck in the ghetto cause its a white system he actually made something of himself good for him wish more people like him worked hard instead of bitch and complain for free handouts and belittle people who worked hard to earn their living
UpliftingNews,removed,we really need to rewrite rape laws to make the accused innocent until proven guilty just like any other crime because now they are defacto guilty until proven innocent thanks to the hard work of college feminists everywhere
UpliftingNews,removed,system rigged against them you mean the one that provides financial aid to low income grant programs and preferred admissions then gives a lsat boost for being a urm then preferential diversity oci to career services rigged
UpliftingNews,removed,is there any information anywhere as to what happened to the female whom accused him and why she accused him
UpliftingNews,removed,whooo caresss
UpliftingNews,removed,hes accomplished something impressive but isnt this a lot of gushing for someone we really dont know much about yea he didnt rape someone but he could still be a total piece of shit for all we know
UpliftingNews,removed,years for alleged rape yet mr mcswimmerman gets a few months for witnessed rape wtf is that good on this guy though that is an amazing turn around
UpliftingNews,removed,its too bad he wasnt really good at swimming
UpliftingNews,removed,would you like to know why i can tell you why its because you calling brock turner an evil bastard for what he did is exactly what they did for this guy back then the only difference is the judge went along with itand only if the turner case isnt overturned brock turner was a drunk kid who fingered a drunk girl thats all your attitude is the reason this stuff happens
UpliftingNews,removed,oh boohoo poor murderers we need them back fuck you you pansy shit murderers deserve to hang
UpliftingNews,removed,chill the fuck out you know what op meant
UpliftingNews,removed,id sue everybody
UpliftingNews,removed,disgraceful i hope jarrett adams got a lot of compensation for that little stunt years of time hell never get back for someone lying hope she got punished as well
UpliftingNews,removed,this is not uplifting a teenager was railroaded by the system and sent to prison the police and prosecutors pressed forward despite the fact that the sex was consentual and the woman he slept with turned around and lied to everyone then his attorney was innefective this is depressing
UpliftingNews,removed,and wave feminists still want no due process for rape accusations
UpliftingNews,removed,i literally hate humans more than dogs
UpliftingNews,removed,s
UpliftingNews,removed,well lets see how long he stays clean before he relapses and is out on the street selling his bones for a rock
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah my guess is that actually ingesting meth would kill a dog pretty quickly even a cup of coffee can be lethal to a dog so i dont see how meth would be any different
UpliftingNews,removed,yes but lets only focus on the accidents that occurs at a less rate than normal drivers
UpliftingNews,removed,one for two tesla still better than my asian girlfriend
UpliftingNews,removed,remember just a few weeks ago tesla was involved in a fatal accident because they driver relied too heavily on the autopilot upliftingnews is the dumping ground for pr grabs and people eat it up
UpliftingNews,removed,nobody just dabbles in meth and heroin stop being an enabler
UpliftingNews,removed,this never happened
UpliftingNews,removed,i moved in owned the cat i stole from my ex got into drugs that were lying around
UpliftingNews,removed,this is nice and everything but realistically wouldnt it have been wiser to euthanize the poor thing and spend the moneytimecare that went into this dogs recovery on the many other dogs that could use it
UpliftingNews,removed,this makes it seem as if bubba here was crawling into storm drains to shoot up or hanging around town selling his body for meth no the god damn dog god into some drugs and almost died sure its sad and fucking disgustingbutthe images in my head now
UpliftingNews,removed,that dog is cheesin his fucking balls off omfg his balls are gone
UpliftingNews,removed,enjoying sticking your dick in a hole filled with shit isnt a mental disorder then im not sure what is
UpliftingNews,removed,not to be a party pooper but theyll probably only use a very small fraction of the donated food its better to donate money instead so they can buy ingredients which they can actually cook with easily
UpliftingNews,removed,people still listen to these bit hacks
UpliftingNews,removed,great now lazy poor people will keep being lazy and poor because they have food s
UpliftingNews,removed,hell yeah i deliver food to steve regularly hes a great tipper and a great guy takes in a lot of rescue cats too
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck my asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,no i am not the dick i want you to be the dick and fuck me i will be the butthole now fuck me do it im right here
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck off preston cheats on his wife
UpliftingNews,removed,food banks dont need food food banks need money a lot of that food is going to be thrown away
UpliftingNews,removed,its not their job to collect food its their job to entertain the audience they dont people only listen because there is no other half decent morning show in the city theres a reason they have never gotten syndicated outside of philly kathy is a fun sucking black hole of comedy
UpliftingNews,removed,food drives are a terrible idea
UpliftingNews,removed,wow even with the sarcasm tag some people are just tripping all over themselves trying to get up on their high horse
UpliftingNews,removed,preston steve is a shitty show for a giant city full of shitty people
UpliftingNews,removed,bet not a single can came from atheists
UpliftingNews,removed,the gang makes a fake charity
UpliftingNews,removed,pathetic right why arent there any jobs so that people can actually buy their own fucking food food banks are just institutionalized poverty and a strong indicator that government is totally fucking up in pretty much everyway
UpliftingNews,removed,bet not a single can came from an atheist
UpliftingNews,removed,avg tin can weighs grams so thats a lot of wasted weight in that food assuming its all canned food or mostly canned food i could seen of that lbs of food being metal
UpliftingNews,removed,this strikes me as one of those times you just leave well enough alone with this shit and not contact the kid who sent the note he might be kinda upset if you let him know the balloon rose until the lack of air pressure caused it to expand pop and fall back to the same mortal coil his father shuffled off of
UpliftingNews,removed,we could do better
UpliftingNews,removed,that fact that they do this is a disgrace
UpliftingNews,removed,i worked for a sample company in canada for a long time in the cases where companies would send the product to us instead of us purchasing it we were by no means allowed to donate the unopened packages we couldnt take them home or give them away to store employees either same went for the opened packages with food left in them
UpliftingNews,removed,dumpster diving is legal in canada as long as you dont have to commit trespass andor breaking entering in order to get to the contents of the dumpster
UpliftingNews,removed,if you were really hungry youd eat these dog biscuits you scum
UpliftingNews,removed,this is what i found in a quick google search for nl seems to only cover human food couldnt find anything related to animal food the good samaritan act in canada covers people when they want to save your life but not get in trouble for like crushing your ribs n shit
UpliftingNews,removed,i think the guy was pissed that chickfila was closed
UpliftingNews,removed,i live right by them the employees were told to cut the bags open when they threw it out the pet food was off and if you bought more than one bag they would give you a better discount
UpliftingNews,removed,when people will pay your bills for you why pay yourself there needs to be a go fund me for the dead yesterday
UpliftingNews,removed,i love being a female muslim i wasnt aware that you was more informed about my religion than myself of course its so easy to make sweeping generalisations about muslims and their faith you sir dont seem to have picked up the quran in your whole life therefore you have no place telling me that i should be ashamed of my religion and teaching me about something you have no idea about i recommend reading the quran if you want to learn about islam its not best to go on the internet thinking you know what you are talking about just because someone on tv told you so you just stick to staying in your little bubble thinking that anyone gives a damn about what you think of islam you are free to voice your opinion about it and people are free to criticise it good day to you and have a happy ramadan
UpliftingNews,removed,you dont have to i dont have to prove anything to you the fact that i pointed out that i was a muslim and you are quick to attack me about the amount of shock and sadness i am feeling hearing this news shows a lot about your character are you really saddened about the loss of beautiful people that had so much to live for or are you just hear to spur up hatred anyways i am not here to argue with you good day and have a lovely ramadan
UpliftingNews,removed,thanks for being a dick about it a link would have been less dick
UpliftingNews,removed,lmao and people still talking about this one person
UpliftingNews,removed,people who believe that they have anonymity
UpliftingNews,removed,cue sarah mclachlan song playing in the background
UpliftingNews,removed,her mothers medical costs not to be a dick but if her daughter was going to be killed it could not have happened at a more fortuitous time for her i guess
UpliftingNews,removed,what a dick he wanted to fuck her in the first place
UpliftingNews,removed,i had that guy kill her i dont know much about her but i just wanted her dead
UpliftingNews,removed,im sorry but isnt this the same company that openly condemned gay marriage
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah chick fil a is against gay marriages and all that but they never wish anyone dead good guy chick fil a
UpliftingNews,removed,omg do you have down syndrome or something or were you just inbred jesus fuck you are dumb let me say this again for the time this time read my response closely ass clown your facts are irrelevant not because they arent true but because they dont apply to this issue if a investigation by the fbi isnt enough to stop a terrorist from getting a gun nothing will so lets move on to talking about a more viable to solution instead of wasting more precious time on something that isnt going to help imagine a general sitting there in the situation room and being asked sir there is an international militarized terrorist cell growing and killing innocent people what should we doand his response is we should restrict americans ability to buy gunsdo you realize how ridiculous that sounds that is like the item on the list of things we should do to combat isis probably lower im sure your stats are true im just saying to save your stats for a thread where its relevant the main issue here is radical islam not gun violence had this been an unmotivated attack by someone who who just wanted to watch the world burn and or had the guns been acquired easily then you might have a case to discuss the viability of gun control laws in preventing the attack but in this case they wouldnt have mattered nor are they the main cause of this tragedy so why even bother bring it it up its a moot point for the record the reason i get so worked up is because last time i checked innocent people are now dead and its misguided people like you who have caused this country to drag its feet in the sand instead of taking a full speed approach to combating this issue every time shit like this happens you have some alternate excuse as to why this happened you purposely try and distract people and convince them that their concerns are misguided that radical islam is not to blame your views quite literally are being used as propaganda for isis and other extremist groups not the other way around they are well aware that our pc culture allows their ideology to thrive and grow your ignorance as become a danger to society we should be telling people to arm themselves not put the guns away so in a sense you have just killed those people through your poor advice and the culture youve assisted in propagating the blood is on your hands thats why id like to spit in your face right now the next terrorist attack that occurs i truly hope from the bottom of my heart that one of your loved ones is killed i mean that sincerely maybe thats what it will take for you to wake up maybe thats the only fair punishment for you to atone for your misguided views you know how people say you shouldnt judge your peers based on their political beliefs well i do judge people based on their political beliefs because they mean more than just beliefs theyre beliefs effect my life so as far as im concerned far left liberals arent just fellow americans who i happen to disagree with they are enemies of my nation they are no more moral than the islamic terrorists they claim to hate yet defend at the same time watch this wwwthegrandeceptioncom reply again and your getting reported to the fbi for being a isis sympathizer
UpliftingNews,removed,this to me is really telling of the great divide between how christianity comes off to outsiders and how it really is from an insiders perspective there is a lot of bad press because homosexuality among literally almost everything else is condemned by christianity as a sin but what most outsiders dont understand and television and movies are largely to blame for this i think is that to a christian being a sinner does not mean youre a bad person quite the contrary in fact because according to them we are all by definition sinners the very heart of the doctrine of christianity is one of noninterventionism acceptance and tolerance there are many aspects of human behavior that are labelled as wrong in the eyes of god but thats never supposed to be used as a means to belittle or judge an individual ex jesus said let he who is without sin cast the first stone explicitly meaning that nobody is perfect we all do things that would be considered sins and therefore its not our job place or purpose to judge others culturally this is why places in the world where christianity has been around for a long time as a cultural bedrock are the only places in the world where you would actually want to live they are the only places that arent totalitarian shitholes with no individual freedom or respect for equality tolerance or any of the values we prize in western society today people like to bash on christianity and there are a lot of aspects of the ideology that i think are negative and toxic to an individual selfhatred but its actually almost objectively wrong to suggest that the world isnt literally times over a better place today because of it
UpliftingNews,removed,no dont shoot
UpliftingNews,removed,ah adam the guy that cancelled tours in nc because of their public restroom laws but went to russia to perform where they throw gays in jail for being gay
UpliftingNews,removed,oh no you dont chick fil a trying to ride that good pr train this bostonian still remembers recent
UpliftingNews,removed,but he had to announce it small investment for huge publicity dont be naive
UpliftingNews,removed,no wonder shes a good karaoke singer that was cute
UpliftingNews,removed,im not asking you to agree with and approve other peoples lifestyles im saying its none of your business in the first place and you should not even be making judgement on it i think the issue here is that a lot of homosexuals say on the one hand its not your business but then want to have the right to march down the street in semimilitant politically motivated parades celebrating their sexual practices its not the same as christmas parades or saint patricks day parades its a very clear political statement and a middle finger to the establishment we live in a world where people are forced to take a political stance on homosexuality because the homosexual lobby is such an important political force given the choice most people christian or otherwise would probably just as soon not hear about your deviant bedroom exploits no matter what they are in fact most people dont really like to hear about normal heterosexual bedroom exploits so thats not even really any different i work with a lot of teens and the number of them who will be scarred for life because their loved ones tell them that theyre a sinner is absolutely appalling keep your backwards views to yourself i dont know what youre mad at me for i agree that its a selfhating ideology its fair to say that christianity breeds selfhatred i just dont think its fair to say that it breeds hatred towards other people dont you think that by telling people theyre backwards every time they disagree with you even respectfully as im doing youre sort of doing a disservice to yourself and your own cause this is your problem you liken being gay to wearing a hat its not a choice no matter how much you want to believe it is its not my problem lol it has nothing to do with me lol im talking about random people on the street and how nobody owes you the courtesy of liking you and approving of your lifestyle come on that last bit the part where you tell me to keep my backwards views to myself just tells me that youre a close minded person who is arguing because they feel an irrational anger or hatred toward other human beings who are different than them
UpliftingNews,removed,cool doesnt change the fact the company is owned by horrible bigots

UpliftingNews,removed,and trump is super popular even though hes a racist sexist bigot shock of the year the general american population sucks and is stupid
UpliftingNews,removed,loathing of lgbt people is certainly homophobia no argument here but i just dont see the belief in traditional marriage or that being gay is a sin as loathing of lgbt people
UpliftingNews,removed,i know the lubbock chick fil a when i see it they always do stuff like that and its really nice bitch to get in and out of the parking lot though so ill give them shit for that instead
UpliftingNews,removed,is that why isis has killed more muslims than nonmuslims he islamic state does not view its victims as muslims indeed mainstream sunni islam—the worlds dominant strand of islam which isis adheres to—views all nonsunnis as false muslims at best they are heretics who need to submit to the true islam this is largely how sunnis view shias and vice versa—hence their perennial war while western talking heads tend to lump them together as muslims—thus reaching the erroneous conclusion that isis is unislamic because it kills fellow muslims—each group views the other as enemies its only in recent times as both groups plot against the west and israel that they occasionally cooperate overall then when sunni jihadis slaughter shias—or sufis druze and bahai lesser groups affiliated with islam to varying degrees—they do so under the same exact logic as when they slaughter christian minorities or european american and israeli citizens all are infidels who must either embrace the true faith be subjugated or die
UpliftingNews,removed,everyone i meet i match for blood donation consolation prize

UpliftingNews,removed,i thought for sure this would be in brampton aka browntown
UpliftingNews,removed,great if hindu weddings werent gay enough already sarcasm
UpliftingNews,removed,the only sad thing about this story to me is that he married some white dud
UpliftingNews,removed,this shouldnt be uplifting news essentially this post is saying we know traditional indian parents suck but hey these guys are an exception because they allowed people to be happy
UpliftingNews,removed,reddit openly celebrates so many female indian babies being killed and women being so undervalued that men are expected to marry men
UpliftingNews,removed,pajeet my son

UpliftingNews,removed,im happy for the two of them but the indian could do better lol
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah its so hard living off welfare and affirmative action that always gives you the job and college spot regardless of your ability to readwrite so hard
UpliftingNews,removed,it never ceases to amaze me how many clueless people think that before the white man came along natives were all living in harmony with the planet and doing complex math and science fuck no they were killing babies and raping women all over which tribe could hunt the most buffalo in a year hundreds of years of settlement in the americas and they produced absolutely nothing of value
UpliftingNews,removed,spent all their money on alcohol and pot
UpliftingNews,removed,christianity doesnt prescribe death for being gay only islam it is mainly only in the historically christian west that gays are accepted
UpliftingNews,removed,now this is a religion of peace
UpliftingNews,removed,wow this sub seems to have completely gotten on board this gay agenda propaganda hasnt it
UpliftingNews,removed,disgusting this world is broken
UpliftingNews,removed,but homosexual relationships are morally wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,im secreply hoping the son isnt even remotely close to gay and the parents are being overly progressive
UpliftingNews,removed,perhaps the ops are lgbt members so they consider these news as uplifting although for the majority it is uniteresting news
UpliftingNews,removed,being gay is a mental illness
UpliftingNews,removed,must be hard to be gay on a traditional indian diet then again if your already used to your asshole bleeding and having a burning sensation being gay wont be that far of a leap regardless that must have been one hell of a party indians know how to have a party i couldnt imagine a gay traditional indian wedding
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,curry on and cumin his butt
UpliftingNews,removed,nobody wants to mention that his husband is probably some sleezy sex tourist i would love to do sex tourism myself so i can imagine that this guy banged the wrong sister and is now being forced to wed her gay rapist brother
UpliftingNews,removed,not uplifting at all to me you want to spend your life with someone else and be happy fine but this is not and will never be comparable to a union that can potentially benefit society with their offspring those parents are throwing away the ethics of their heritage in accepting this socially regressive practice
UpliftingNews,removed,harold and kumar get married
UpliftingNews,removed,this is gross
UpliftingNews,removed,the thing is gay marriage is unnatural sperm egg human sperm sperm nothing egg egg nothing

UpliftingNews,removed,goldsteins experience is a good example of the consequences of microsofts forced windows upgrades everybody knows windows is the greatest operating system microsoft ever build but the companys approach of its distribution went wrong even if users didnt like to move to windows microsoft is forcing them to upgrade their older versions of windows wtf kind of stalinesque writing is going on over fuck windows
UpliftingNews,removed,this is what china allows its citizens to do to dogs not wolves but dogs bread as human companions warning nsfl
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont suggest anything because there isnt an alternative solution i can think of adoption drives transfers like you mentioned and any efforts they can take to improve demand and reduce the number of animals coming in are all wonderful and reduce the amount of animals that need to be put down that reduces the problem and if you reduce the problem enough it disappears but it isnt really a solution to the problem if there are to many animals to deal with something must be done currently the solution unfortunate though it is is to put some of them down i am not saying we shouldnt try to reduce the need for that as much as possible but that doesnt mean there is a viable alternative solution
UpliftingNews,removed,this is why people need to get their pets from an animal shelter rather than petsmart

UpliftingNews,removed,true pain of demonetisation
UpliftingNews,removed,christians are the most persecuted religion on earth today over christians were brutally murdered in solely because of their faith and not a fucking peep from the mass media
UpliftingNews,removed,i never said where they were murdered you are a psychopathic asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,just here to make sure that fake news doesnt spread around then you proceed to manipulate and lie to people go fuck yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting news somebody died and their relatives had trouble finding a cemetary that would accept his corpse
UpliftingNews,removed,muslims are forbidden by their faith to embalm their dead and as a result the decaying bodies contaminate the local aquifer also islam is the only major religion which specifically lays out specific requirements for rape
UpliftingNews,removed,whats uplifting about this a couple of muslims declined to be total dickbags therefore lifes wonderful gimme a break
UpliftingNews,removed,garbage post upvotted by muslim shills as per usual downvoted and reported on all my reddit accounts

UpliftingNews,removed,it was a nonmalicious lighthearted joke i wouldnt call it making fun of a child with a disability i would say your tone and comments are bordering on autistic aspergers also fuck that stupid bitch with the prosthetic hand
UpliftingNews,removed,my thoughts exactly what a nice guy annnndddd hes dead
UpliftingNews,removed,now all they have to do is download the app and create an account on their smart phones
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry i dont spend a lot of time here so im not too sure of the rules so you cant express your opinion of others find it negative because that seems to be what youre suggesting it may very well be a rule in which case ill delete my posts to adhere to the rules but if it is then how can you act like this isnt just a circle jerk of like minded people who all just happen to have the same small views of what they consider uplifting i just thought it was interesting you chose to use the phrase circle jerk in an attempt to tell people that they shouldnt be posting views different from your own
UpliftingNews,removed,and then they become squatters
UpliftingNews,removed,terrible idea cant fix the worlds problems by bringing them home
UpliftingNews,removed,then his wife gets raped
UpliftingNews,removed,what is this the dark ages how is this exceptionally uplifting news and not common place in
UpliftingNews,removed,thats what happens when you follow christ and not paul or leviticus
UpliftingNews,removed,its pretty obvious hes gay just by the way he looks did he really have to come out
UpliftingNews,removed,wow support for a gay person like theyve done nothing wrong and its still only the default ethical position of these institutions will be seen as an absolute joke in less than years hopefully
UpliftingNews,removed,aaand not before
UpliftingNews,removed,oh wow someone wasnt a dick because of mythology whoopee
UpliftingNews,removed,degeneracy is becoming rampant
UpliftingNews,removed,theres part of me that says yes i want to love people that disagree with me who disagree with us but the other part of me now is asking but how can i do it in way that honors you if hes seriously asking this he doesnt know his own faith and should not be preaching to anybody
UpliftingNews,removed,why didnt she abort it
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting because a religious leader isnt a massive bigot for a change if you say so
UpliftingNews,removed,cause again for anyone whos actually a christian that practices the old testament more than the new you might as well convert to judaism considering jesus pushed against the rules and norms of the pharisee these hypocrites seem to ignore all the other rules they break in the bible but love to single out minorities to hate on amazing in that jesus held more modern views than many conservative christians
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont like talking about my delusions either
UpliftingNews,removed,if you dont mind us asking what do you mean by saying youre gay do you mean that in a biological sense or something else you saying youre gay or homosexual does that mean you would like to have sex with another man and not a woman do you look to the bible as justifying your choice im sorry if some of these questions come of as rather blunt direct off i am just really curious what your thoughts are on these
UpliftingNews,removed,this is the most retarded subreddit on this site
UpliftingNews,removed,hey fag why do you like dick
UpliftingNews,removed,some semen of support
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont know the exact scripture but im pretty sure there is one i think the word abomination is used to describe the act of a man laying with another man
UpliftingNews,removed,no problem my boy i fully accept you love cocks up your arse
UpliftingNews,removed,sweet sodomy like it
UpliftingNews,removed,theists cherrypicking as usual aint it fun to have a mythology you can interpret as you see fit
UpliftingNews,removed,lol such a joke we dont have to go by what the bible says im still a pastor and a good christian
UpliftingNews,removed,pastor is hitting on him
UpliftingNews,removed,when god walked the earth in the flesh as jesus he tells us the very reason for marriage and a physical union is that we were made male and female jesus also tells us that we must love him more than our sons and daughters or we are not worthy of him to deny the very words god spoke out of love for your son is to no longer be worthy of christ
UpliftingNews,removed,isnt this a fun thread
UpliftingNews,removed,thats a disgusting attitude its still equating their normal perfectly acceptable sexuality with lying cheating stealing murdering and raping actually not raping since thats not actually a sin in this deranged bronze age version of morals same bigotry different syntax the very concept of sin is itself flat out immoral
UpliftingNews,removed,whenever i read a title in that format i immediately think its clickhole now
UpliftingNews,removed,interesting so let me put it this way they disagree with blacks being black thats not condemnation its disagreeingyes
UpliftingNews,removed,so youre equating the relationship i have with my fiance with us being murderers nice how about you go and fuck yourself you worthless cunt
UpliftingNews,removed,man you religious folk are fuckin nutty
UpliftingNews,removed,because thats what is the next big topic abroad here its whats in the media its what they still have a chance to win at this point though even trying is just a way to bide time until the inevitable
UpliftingNews,removed,doesnt christianity explicitly state that lying with the same gender is punishable by eternity in hell whats with this absolutely weird rise in progressiveness in these religions weird
UpliftingNews,removed,ironic because bible clearly does not support homosexuality
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck people who only care about things once it impacts them
UpliftingNews,removed,liberals have been manually programmed into feeling extreme happiness when sodomy is publicly celebrated and christianity is undermined i dont know why they dont just wake up and realize their brains are distributed nodes used to advance an agenda which does not care about them at all
UpliftingNews,removed,im glad his son wasnt an atheist hed probably decide he didnt believe in god either
UpliftingNews,removed,wow a dad supporting his son fuck me never seen that before how is this news
UpliftingNews,removed,the he doesnt understand the religion hes a part of
UpliftingNews,removed,i guess im glad for that kid that his father doesnt hate or condemn him but really all thats happening here is the pastor is being a heretic in his own religion these are the cognitive dissonances that religion creates in our modern times
UpliftingNews,removed,sadly hed be wrong to support his sons life of sin strictly according to his holy book his son is an abomination in the eyes of god
UpliftingNews,removed,the pastor is probably gay as wellit runs in the family one family i met they all were gay
UpliftingNews,removed,that same chapter also condemns tattoos jewelry and eating shellfish as similarly offensive abominations among many other things that god of yours was kind of a dick when people who heard him were considered prophets instead of schizophrenics thank god literacy and reason are the new bare minimum
UpliftingNews,removed,yes i am they either werent gay to begin with or they have abolished their gay lifestyle but are still gay inside well youre honest im on the side of not judging people anyways the best you can do for those converts of gay to straight is judgment not evidence you have nothing on them to say they were never gay to begin with nothing if anything they have the upperhand as many people who know them will probably testify that they indeed acted gay in the past and are no longer acting like that right now you have nothing on them nothing but judgment that s the best you can come up with its not evidence that was my point appreciate the honesty
UpliftingNews,removed,my hometown too good ole cle town
UpliftingNews,removed,plot twist the dad stole it the kid found it in the house the mom found out and probably took a lashing to her babys daddy created cover story to return the medal

UpliftingNews,removed,im waiting for them to add morbidly obese avatars so people can finally be within their own skin also all games from now on need fat fucking characters because nowadays people cant handle growing the fuck up and dealing with their problems
UpliftingNews,removed,how long will it be until the call of duty maps have to be wheel chair accessible
UpliftingNews,removed,in the game it is a chat virtual world creative space second life from lindenlab handicapped persons use wheelchairs on their avatars since already about years in the marketplace of this virtual world you can choose from between hundreds if not thousands of different wheelchairs from freebie wheelchairs from up to crazy designer wheelchairs or you just build your own wheelchair inside the world or modify a wheelchair you can add burnouts wheelies make them fly i saw even wheelchair dance animations whatever the heart of a handicapped person demands if i remember right theres even wheelchairs that have tons of sex animations in the menu ♿♋♿ 😃

UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder how much the gun nuts will raise for the cops defense fund
UpliftingNews,removed,can i get one for an obese autistic feminist
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont know in general does more exposure uppen your threshold its like the smell you stop smelling you got used to it i would assume that sex offenders have a more complex problem and that exposure alone wont really be much of a factor though to be fair it is reasonable to consider that the overexposure of sexuality in our every day world could cause trouble in the minds or brains of certain individuals ignorant the psychopaths who raoe for fun not out of a desperate need
UpliftingNews,removed,i identify as handicapkin and i need this wheelchair option to truly be whole
UpliftingNews,removed,great now theyll be called crippled nigger instead of just nigger when they own someone in halo or cod

UpliftingNews,removed,the church cannot be accepting of homosexuality because it is clearly shown to be a sin the fact that this church so openly accepts this is just proof how far from the truth they have fallen romans wherefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves for that they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed for ever amen for this cause god gave them up unto vile passions for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working unseemliness and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due

UpliftingNews,removed,if you arent responsible enough to keep a floor under your feet youre not responsible enough to own a dog
UpliftingNews,removed,you dont live around homeless people im guessing most of them around here in denver use them as props to help them beg ive even seen them cycle through puppies dog gets to old time to dump it somewhere and get a new begging puppy
UpliftingNews,removed,again another person that doesnt have to interact with homeless people this guy is probably in a most homeless people abuse their dogs or otherwise use them as props for begging ive seen people in denver cycle through prop puppies ditching the dogs when they get too old
UpliftingNews,removed,you just dont know homeless people that i do ive seen mentally unstable people abuse their dogs on the street train them to fight be aggressive etc of course there are going to be some good apples that can raise a mutt on the street but thats not going to be most
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe but thats not what ive seen like i said ive literally seen the same people with different puppies over the course of months and ive seen this happen with or groups im around the homeless everyday how often do you interact with beggars

UpliftingNews,removed,came here for this comment mission complete
UpliftingNews,removed,but she did have sex with him then decided later she didnt want to kind of a dick move that turns innocent men into lifetime convicts which impair their ability to freely move and operate in society
UpliftingNews,removed,now who would do thatoh wait this is reddit carry on mod
UpliftingNews,removed,nice try your name would be gone too
UpliftingNews,removed,i wish that was still an option would a part time downs person be cheaper than the price and upkeep of a bending press
UpliftingNews,removed,except they wont call it an engagement ring
UpliftingNews,removed,cringe
UpliftingNews,removed,the way i read it she wasnt withdrawing consent retroactively she was merely stating that she did not desire an encore performance
UpliftingNews,removed,ive found that a person who uses the word flippant without irony or using it facetiously is almost always a person with a stiff object up his or her own asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah but he prolly also wants to get his dick wet lovingly of course
UpliftingNews,removed,because shes smoking hot

UpliftingNews,removed,sorry but i would bully you too if i heard you listening to that shit
UpliftingNews,removed,reddits favorite insult is autist but i doubt ops post is going to get people thinking anyway good on richard and little ryan very nice to hear
UpliftingNews,removed,videos in this thread videocomment heres the video he recently made for aphex twin fairly certain its an autistic person singing so it all makes sense actually someone posted this cover of flim i thought it was pretty awesome the video the kid made not just taste but a little bit of talent too this kid is seriously going places im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
UpliftingNews,removed,i wish i was retarded so i could direct famous artists music videos
UpliftingNews,removed,calling bullshit to the max nobody bullied anybody for liking aphex twin trying to make a feel good story out of nowhere like naming any random right video poor kid beats up his bully to get more clicks disgusting

UpliftingNews,removed,rfowardsfromgrandma
UpliftingNews,removed,is uplifting news now a default sub is uplifting news the new place to go for news about autistic kids and children with down syndrome
UpliftingNews,removed,can we all just agree to say retarded instead of autistic we dont need all these subcategories
UpliftingNews,removed,sounds like a defener to me
UpliftingNews,removed,wheres obamas nice music wyler wanna bring it to the white house
UpliftingNews,removed,this is probably going to be buried but the title bothers me hes not an autistic boy saying it like that defines him by his autism hes just a boy he had all that same feelings and emotions and struggles and joys as everyone else theres a difference here and its subtle but it means something hes a boy with autism not an autistic boy
UpliftingNews,removed,general rule of thumb if you listen to actual music that isnt a pile of samplers with black people screaming nigga every seconds chances are your taste in music is good music today is complete shit
UpliftingNews,removed,of course hes autistic
UpliftingNews,removed,you got it backwards women are basically kids theyre coddled by society and never taught to grow up
UpliftingNews,removed,now just because his taste in music is poor doesnt mean you should bully him
UpliftingNews,removed,plebbitors like autists because most plebbitors have autism themselves
UpliftingNews,removed,theres absolutely nothing in that piece about bullying pretty weird for the op to invent that for headline electronic music is not something kids in europe get grief for listening to its pretty much been mainstream for years at this point

UpliftingNews,removed,flahblub
UpliftingNews,removed,holy shit thats one ugly kid coupled with autism and an unreasonably young age to be a fan of such a hardcore act as aphex twin this kid was probably a serious pain in the ass for his fellow students source myself and couple friends were ugly fucking little aohex twin fans in middle school one of us is autistic and we were unbearable
UpliftingNews,removed,dude you listen to apex twin who the fuck is that your such a loser your only cool if you listen to fallout boy if only those bullys knew how retarded they really were if i met this kid i would be giving him a hig five for good tastes in music

UpliftingNews,removed,if you have terrible taste in music you should get shit for it but probably not if youre autistic
UpliftingNews,removed,i too am annoyed when people like things
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe hes autistic because he listens to electronic music the more you know
UpliftingNews,removed,autism is a form of mental retardation
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck off retard

UpliftingNews,removed,unbelievable regret
UpliftingNews,removed,im with you theres nothing uplifting about this story it belongs on rwtf
UpliftingNews,removed,agreed worst uplifting post ever
UpliftingNews,removed,so you have the mindset of a teenager no wonder
UpliftingNews,removed,til death due us part oh thank god i can start dating in months
UpliftingNews,removed,if you really love someone set them free by dying
UpliftingNews,removed,you knowthats likejust your uneducated opinionbro
UpliftingNews,removed,she could definitely say no lol
UpliftingNews,removed,and isnt the nonbible belt all about not judging you all are judging these two for no other reason than that you disagree
UpliftingNews,removed,this is depressing as shit
UpliftingNews,removed,i used to work with a girl who got put in a similar position she would leave work to be at the hospital and she hated her life when asked shed pretend to be happy but when you spend a week with someone you pick up on things she was absolutely miserable this isnt uplifting in the least its insane the parents or doctors didnt bitch slap some sense into her
UpliftingNews,removed,its been mentioned quite specifically in the ceremony of most weddings ive attended the only exceptions being those ceremonies that substituted as long as you both shall live for the more traditional til death do you part
UpliftingNews,removed,jokes on her she thinks hes not gonna make it so no real commitment hell pull through and shell be stuck with him nice play swift nice play
UpliftingNews,removed,well we already know the sickness part but do you promise to love him in health
UpliftingNews,removed,she is doing it for the publicity little whore
UpliftingNews,removed,he was dying to marry her
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck that guy dont appreciate a damn thing he just made this
UpliftingNews,removed,fucking soul crushing a teens mind is so fucking fragile and all knowing would be so terrible if either passed
UpliftingNews,removed,no one under should consider it absolutely stupid what if i want kids jackass or is your career more important
UpliftingNews,removed,there is nothing uplifting about teen marriage
UpliftingNews,removed,i cant get a girl but this fat bald retard is literally dying and still pulls ass like that id like to slap that little smirk he has off his face too i am callin bullshit on this whole thing
UpliftingNews,removed,they are in fucking highschool
UpliftingNews,removed,this sub has gone downhill over the past year
UpliftingNews,removed,i give the marriage months
UpliftingNews,removed,is too young to be getting married normally yes but hes also facing a deadly disease with lifelong implications assuming he survives and undergoing treatment that affects his state of mind oh thats different
UpliftingNews,removed,i wouldnt have allowed my daughter to marry him if this were my son i would tell him not to be so greedy and to let that girl go have a normal life
UpliftingNews,removed,aww fuck dude i was gonna break up with him now im fucked i cant say no to this fuck fuck fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,based on the way she looks atleast one of his bones will stay nice and stiff for a long time
UpliftingNews,removed,gold digger

UpliftingNews,removed,he became real irritable sounds like a marine all right
UpliftingNews,removed,why the fk do kids like him get cancer and die while im just here and years old sitting on a toilet in an apartment my parents bought to support their only nokissnohugnohandholding virgin boy fkn bullshit my uncle with sons and daughters died of bone marrow cancer last week too the only reason why i dont kill myself is because my mom would drown herself in tears and it would be a hassle for the paramedics to move my dead body anyways rip i wish his family the best of luck and i hope that girl succeeds in life god dann
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont really care that much
UpliftingNews,removed,and hows the marriage working out so far still having good sex i hope
UpliftingNews,removed,na they banned me for trolling a troll it didnt suit theyre pedal powered politically correct agenda so fuck them
UpliftingNews,removed,ita really getting out of control
UpliftingNews,removed,and she went
UpliftingNews,removed,completely safe drug totally never fucked anyone up permanently ever while we are at it lets get fly amanita to be as socially acceptable too the world needs more alice in wonderlands
UpliftingNews,removed,hiw many three
UpliftingNews,removed,my first thought after reading this was that if they make a habit of this that will desensitize those regularly attending catholics to the presence of nonchurch members this sets up a scenario where a radicalized agent could then attend in solidarity and set off a bomb while everyones guard is down
UpliftingNews,removed,can hillary get down there and convince them its in our best interest for them to continue oh wait shes due in the office soon no need to vote people just keep being sheep well convince them soon enough everything will work itself out juuuuusst fine
UpliftingNews,removed,this is absurd power hallucinogens should be and should remain illegal do them if you want but theyre not for everyone and people shouldnt be advertising them like they are and cant cause any harm or permanent damage also definitely not a treatment for depression i had depressionanxiety and had a bad trip that was quite easily the most horrifying experience of my entire life it is an experience that has consequences that are hard to describe i havent been the same since and am taking it one day at a time but its also why im so offended to see this kind of attitude towards the drug
UpliftingNews,removed,your username tells me we have nothing to discuss
UpliftingNews,removed,very nice of india to help the tigers especially considering how many of them have been killed by tigers
UpliftingNews,removed,can i get a job so i stay away from gangs i mean there arent any here but i could start one if i had to
UpliftingNews,removed,thats a good scam
UpliftingNews,removed,i would like to add more to this story government refused this mining project not to save tigers but because the state government werent bribed at all they wanted a huge chunk of money from the project but when refused they decided to use tigers as a front to stop this the state is one of the most corrupt places in india and they have refused industries before because they werent paid
UpliftingNews,removed,youre getting pussy either way
UpliftingNews,removed,i wont rejoice until the very end its all fun and joy until the next news comes out india uses tigers to retrieve diamonds from caves
UpliftingNews,removed,this
UpliftingNews,removed,oh he did he took it from the front page and tried to convert it with a top comment he just changed it to usd and reposted gotta get that karma
UpliftingNews,removed,ohwoo now japan can let in hordes of muslims exactly like every other female elected official has tried to do
UpliftingNews,removed,tigers before diamonds the slightly modified version of pearls before swine
UpliftingNews,removed,and people wonder why india is poor their elites care more about fucking tigers than making their people prosperous
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah the killing of kashmiris is really uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,enjoy the poverty
UpliftingNews,removed,everywhere females get in charge that society fails women suck as leaders uplifting news that jackass
UpliftingNews,removed,surely with all that money they could the environment much more mines arent that big and they are temporary they are just an artists rendition of anti environmentalism
UpliftingNews,removed,i assume the bus was burning at the front so they couldnt use the front door and the kids had to jump out the back im guessing she caught each one as they jumped
UpliftingNews,removed,even adults tend to get frozen by fire the kids were probably hysterical
UpliftingNews,removed,why dont you faggots go troll somewhere else instead of posting about how awesome this is you both gotta come in here like the typical reddit trolls and go off topic
UpliftingNews,removed,the same parents hailing her a hero will file suits tomorrow she did not maintain a safe environment for travel even though she does not own or maintain the bus they always name all people involved in suits numbers game if we dont get the owner then get the mechanic and last but not least get the driver it is the american way
UpliftingNews,removed,i love hearing stories like this this kid is a wonderful soul
UpliftingNews,removed,shes got that look of mhmm n i told his ass he was still goin to skoo i love her
UpliftingNews,removed,did u here what i said this bitch is on fire but my backpack aint nobody got time for dat slaps little girl in the face
UpliftingNews,removed,pulls from vehicle or the kids just realized the bus was on fire and got the hell out of there
UpliftingNews,removed,ive been waiting for this
UpliftingNews,removed,this is exactly what i was thinking when i read that quote how hard is it to tell everyone to get off the bus one by one are you shitting me
UpliftingNews,removed,well she didnt stay for the interview so
UpliftingNews,removed,how would she not get them out one by one the exits only allow for one kid at a time they mayve also been little and needed help also their bus was literally on fire and they were probably freaked the hell out
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel triggered
UpliftingNews,removed,if shes a hero and kaitlyn jenner is a hero then what is stopping the rich from getting richer and the poor from getting poorer
UpliftingNews,removed,either the kids froze and she had to get them one by one or this means that she stayed in the bus helping the kids down one by one so she could have a head count the fact that she went back in just to check if there were any left is what makes her a hero one of the kids could have been passed out or hiding scared and she could have easily missed them instead she went back into a burning bus to make sure all the kids were out and safe as a dad i dont even live in maryland and im grateful to her for doing that
UpliftingNews,removed,these kids too young to get lit
UpliftingNews,removed,one by one is just a turn of phrase i doubt she literally made each kid sit there in a burning bus and wait as she personally escorted each student out one at a time the point was she got each and every student out with that said was she running through flames and throwing children over her shoulder and dragging them out no but she did get all the children out of the bus rather than run for her own life at the first sight of danger thats the point she did her job and got all kids of safely if my child were on that bus i would be very thankful for what she did
UpliftingNews,removed,simon burch is trans now good to know
UpliftingNews,removed,take it easy bud do you really think this story makes absolutely no sense each aspect of the story is at least plausible so even if there is a chance its exaggerated or made up its not enough to say it makes no sense thats just you being a dick
UpliftingNews,removed,my school busses up until the grade made me wear a seatbelt maybe the graders were having trouble
UpliftingNews,removed,she should be commended but really what else was she going to do go home this is heroic but not national news heroic
UpliftingNews,removed,just hyperbole heres how i see it somebody notices the back of the bus is on fire maybe her maybe a kid fire is very small or maybe just creating smoke at this point she stops the bus stands by the door near the drivers seat and ushers the kids off one at a time one by one however you want to describe each kid passing by her once last kid passes her by she takes a quick check to see if theres anyone else and then gets out of the bus herself cut to a few minutes later when the cops show up and the small fire has turned into a big fire she acted quickly and did a great job of protecting these kids but dont think she had to carry each one out on her shoulder and administer lifesaving cpr or anything like that that said excellent job reneita
UpliftingNews,removed,again calm down youre so ready for someone to take on your preemptive how dare you spiel i agree there may be aspects to the story that are sketchy but certainly not enough to say it makes no sense which leads me to believe youre saying it just to shit disturb for no reason
UpliftingNews,removed,see harambe is good to the churrins
UpliftingNews,removed,mrs forizzle
UpliftingNews,removed,im glad youve recognized your own faults good day
UpliftingNews,removed,despite my timidness im still being downvoted ive watched the post points go up and down it happens often on here its frustrating as hell because i do just try to put forth a rational point of commentary on a particular matter and for some damn reason people downvote the hell out of me im seriously not sarcasm fascinated by your spot on analysis of my post
UpliftingNews,removed,if this is for real way to fucking be girl
UpliftingNews,removed,if it wasnt i would have let those little shits roast
UpliftingNews,removed,i think even by kindergarten i knew to run from fire
UpliftingNews,removed,no its to keep baby boomers hungry for reverse mortgages hovrrounds and jitterbug phones
UpliftingNews,removed,and the best part is she wasnt promptly shot by first responders that only happens when trying to help special needs people out apparently
UpliftingNews,removed,bot for a programming class project that has gone longer than expected because folks seem to like it
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre spinning the story its not like she found the bus and the bus driver was unconscious and she was able to shimmy the door open and free the kids from the burning bus she is the bus driver the bus probably caught on fire in the engine and broke down then she probably said oh lawd errbody off then minutes later the fire makes its way to the inside
UpliftingNews,removed,lol you tried still sound stupid tho sorry
UpliftingNews,removed,this person is in the uplifting new subreddit
UpliftingNews,removed,rofl what was she supposed to run off screaming while the kids stayed inside or something how about extinguishing the fire what started it to begin with was she driving with the ebrakes on the entire time story seems like an exaggeration to get views
UpliftingNews,removed,bad people do exist
UpliftingNews,removed,lets be frank here great job awesome work no seat belts right ok soassuming they werent below the age of lets for a moment assume if anyone did die because they thought its a good idea to stay on board todaythats natures way of making a selection
UpliftingNews,removed,she shouldve let them die the less inner city kids the safer the streets are
UpliftingNews,removed,srs sjw and corporate interests are better served by the website now though come on friend get with the times plus hair trigger censorship really encourages good conversation you know
UpliftingNews,removed,kid had a wasp in his jacket kid cried ofc bus driver grabbed kid by the throat and punched him in the face bus driver was not fired
UpliftingNews,removed,take off your fuckin bluetooth for fuck sakes bitch who the fuck she think she is oprah
UpliftingNews,removed,httpwwwhitchtheworldcom httpwwwthingsinsquarescomcomicsthemodernnomad
UpliftingNews,removed,so because she didnt do her proper pretrip inspection and endangered childrens lives shes a hero poor maintenance and negligence are now hero qualities wonderful
UpliftingNews,removed,this creature already has a smeared memory by people look at that thing
UpliftingNews,removed,these lil niggas not practice jumpin out the back of the bus like we did in elementary
UpliftingNews,removed,she had a really big cock
UpliftingNews,removed,d listtransgender reality tv star actress
UpliftingNews,removed,thank god because im pretty sure that no one wanted to see that anyway im not even saying that to be mean either
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,his
UpliftingNews,removed,i have no idea whos that but i definitely dont want to see hisher sextape
UpliftingNews,removed,even if referring to actions a trans person makes before they transitioned the preferred pronoun is their chosen one especially as heshe is used very often as a pejorative and promotes the cissexist idea that trans women are just men in dresses
UpliftingNews,removed,oh thats gross but like which video exactly theres like so many of them
UpliftingNews,removed,they probably destroyed it because one look at that thing naked had a reaction the same way as swallowing ghost peppers would absolute disgust and vomiting
UpliftingNews,removed,talk about a video that would have virtually zero public interest glad this company prevented it from going into the wild though
UpliftingNews,removed,i love the fact that you used the word cissexist and are completely serious about it shakes head laughing
UpliftingNews,removed,who would want to see this freak show naked
UpliftingNews,removed,he must have not give a very good sexual performance or been very entertaining because thats the only reason i can think of to destroy a tape really if the sex was any good what better way to remember the fruitloop
UpliftingNews,removed,she was a transvestite how can her image be smeared any more
UpliftingNews,removed,lmfao to avoid smearing her memory and theyre talking about alexis arquette lolol thats hilarious
UpliftingNews,removed,gender fluidity is the main reason republicans can get way with saying one day your a man another day your a women
UpliftingNews,removed,good thing they destroyed it that dude is ugly
UpliftingNews,removed,trans women are just men in dresses literally
UpliftingNews,removed,i saw the tape a while back and let me tell ya she has the biggest penis of any woman ive ever seen
UpliftingNews,removed,you are the only person in this thread who has used that word no need to be so preemptively defensive about it
UpliftingNews,removed,we have have but one rule dont be a dick oh the irony
UpliftingNews,removed,this subreddit is just paid propaganda nonsense wonder why the admins made it a default subreddit
UpliftingNews,removed,what a poor twisted soul
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope the sex tape was when she was much younger because based off of those pics i dont think anyone would want to watch that porn wait a minute was it so gross that they deleted it because they never wanted it to see the light of day kind of like another girls cup level of hideousness so they decided it best to burn it with fire the world will never know
UpliftingNews,removed,the assumption being that someone would actually want to see this tape why do they keep insulting females by referring to this weirdo as she
UpliftingNews,removed,so how does this work do we have to check how a persons gender has been updated every morning
UpliftingNews,removed,hes dead its not really possible to invade a dead persons privacy
UpliftingNews,removed,god damni really wanted to fap to a transgender aids patient in a compromising position
UpliftingNews,removed,perhaps i was slightly disrespectful but have you read some of these comments
UpliftingNews,removed,lol what memory
UpliftingNews,removed,they have a mental illness so its no wonder theyre confusing
UpliftingNews,removed,who
UpliftingNews,removed,oh my god who the hell cares
UpliftingNews,removed,much more tolerant than left wing gawker

UpliftingNews,removed,she was a degenerate whore smear away
UpliftingNews,removed,who would wanna see it
UpliftingNews,removed,if anyone finds a link you know where to find me
UpliftingNews,removed,the real reason is who the fuck would want to see that abomination
UpliftingNews,removed,there is such thing as good news and it cums in the shape of porn
UpliftingNews,removed,what is uplifting about suppressing reality to make history look cleaner we do it with our historical figures all the time and yet we cheer when ugly truths about them are exposed but since this person is a sjw suppressing reality is aokay
UpliftingNews,removed,how the fuck is this uplifting news i literally couldnt give a fuck and now you made me search for the sextape
UpliftingNews,removed,am i the only one who read the first line of the title and was disappointed to hear there is no tape
UpliftingNews,removed,why would anyone want a sextape of someone with a mental illness
UpliftingNews,removed,as if anyone would even want to see it
UpliftingNews,removed,well they are pretty confused
UpliftingNews,removed,what could possibly smear the memory of alexis arquette
UpliftingNews,removed,why
UpliftingNews,removed,he you insensitive bigot he decided he was a he just prior to his death you asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,lol her
UpliftingNews,removed,i dig it
UpliftingNews,removed,i just discovered it so did hitler deserve to die with dignity and respect
UpliftingNews,removed,get out of here with that nonsense the only fluid in that guy was hiv positive

UpliftingNews,removed,they need to ban islam in europe
UpliftingNews,removed,just this week in the netherlands islam is a threat to us all ban islammuslims arent welcome
UpliftingNews,removed,i believe you are incorrect because you are over simplifying the huge middle ground of people in her life that she may be acquaintances with or just not really good friends with who wouldnt have known the details you seem to be saying well everyone she is close to will be in court for her so they will hear it and this is completely incorrect aside from a very close family member or no one else is going to be there in court unless the victim wants them too most people try and be supportive while still respecting the privacy of the victim there are dozens of people she knows that likely wouldnt get these graphic details unless they were posted nationally be them coworkers friends and even family members i feel like you are basically assuming most people in her life would have a source within the police station they would each tap to spill details or something
UpliftingNews,removed,the chick is gonna gave some sort of palsy
UpliftingNews,removed,then a redditor read the article and linked it on the subreddit upliftingnews apparantly a lot of people liked reading it so they upvoted it whats wrong with that nothing its just convient when combined with the other thread you should have issue with the other threads being blocked not by this one being on the frontpage the redditor who just so happens to be a pro migrant german hearts and minds hearts and minds
UpliftingNews,removed,yup total ignorance
UpliftingNews,removed,which is related to this subreddit in what way
UpliftingNews,removed,its not your history its just history because you wont tell the story i will mohammad ordered a tribe of jews who wouldnt convert or fight for him as arrow fodder be killed every single male was stripped naked and if he had pubes he was put to death along with a woman who refused to be a sex slave all of their wives daughters and mothers watched them get beheaded one by one while they were being raped by their new muslim owners mohammad even took at least one for himself a fresh new year old sex slave he took from a man he beheaded a man whose tribe committed no violence against him and denying aisha was is a lie and you know it we have her own hadith and its recounted elsewhere as well
UpliftingNews,removed,shocker the trump supporters are even invading rupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,removed,will keep my ear out for news of the structures bombing later this year not on rnews though no one likes censorship
UpliftingNews,removed,now lets wait for it to blow up
UpliftingNews,removed,funny how that statistic doesnt include american army crimes since the id wager they would contend with the sunnis one only has so many cheeks to turn applies on both sides suni and american
UpliftingNews,removed,no the equivalency would be if someone was saying look at these nazis why are we all afraid to admit that western civilization is the problem this argument has gotten so nebulous and wide stretching that its worthless no one is a fucking apologist for islamic terrorism people start defending muslims when we hear people get as extreme as the islamic terrorists and suggest that we nuke the entire middle east
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean like christians do for the children they then rape
UpliftingNews,removed,easy there hitler

UpliftingNews,removed,what terror attack oh by the way guys some muslims just built church never change rexxit
UpliftingNews,removed,its only the negative things about the muslim extremists that the media decides to report reread your sentence to see how big of a reach youre trying to make if you still dont get it please tell us all about the positive things you think muslim extremists do
UpliftingNews,removed,so they know where to find them just kidding
UpliftingNews,removed,rthedonald understands that every single muslim is not an issue the problem is that you have more muslims who are problems than arent if you were told that you had to have people from a prison live with you for years and that only of them were murderers its still a problem and you dont know who is who either
UpliftingNews,removed,war is profitable in this society the ones with the greatest wealth have access to the media we are bombarded with constant propaganda
UpliftingNews,removed,youve activated my trap card
UpliftingNews,removed,they burn the entire house with the family inside
UpliftingNews,removed,hes been working his ass of to fend off ispropaganda and wahabism he is going to get shot
UpliftingNews,removed,the orlando massacre happens and here you are to tell us how great the muslim community is
UpliftingNews,removed,the life of jesus is almost nothing at all like that of mohammed the latter was a warlord who pillaged raped and conquered his enemies
UpliftingNews,removed,please stop insulting my intelligence then stop being obtuse on what grounds do you have a reason to believe that the statistics i posted are false you have nothing but vague complaints about statistical analysis wouldnt it be easier for you to provide contradicting evidence why do so many islamic countries follow sharia law if they are moderate as you claim
UpliftingNews,removed,because if the title didnt say muslim no one would give a shit yup the islamophobes wouldnt have a reason to come in and vomit all over the place and i just love how youre making this comment after some muslim just killed a bunch of people i fully acknowledge we have shitlords among our followers but that doesnt give islamophobes a free pass to smear us ordinary muslims or our good acts
UpliftingNews,removed,nice timed propaganda
UpliftingNews,removed,the thing is we are so worried about each others feelings that we are letting wahhabism kill innocent people you have absolutely no idea if the majority of muslims are good people you are just making things up so you feel better about not judging wahhabism is promoting and here we are discussing how we should not offend anyone cause that may hurt our feelings if your muslim friends are good people tell them to speak about wahhabi if they care about the lives that were lost this day they should come upfront and help us defeat this evil ideology of course not billion muslims are bad people but their religon is promoting the death of innocent people its time to do something about it instead of keep crying about islamophobia
UpliftingNews,removed,whats up with christians and sacrificing living things you guys sacrifice people eg jesus and almost abrahams son and you sacrifice goats you christians are goat fucker keep your backwards religion out of the us we dont need your kind suppressing gay rights and other liberties for people
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck off you aborted fetus

UpliftingNews,removed,great thats what a couple hundred bucks for each of the americans murdered by muslims last night thanks guys that totally makes up for a follower of islam following the teachings of islam and committing violence on its behalf the same way muslims do every day
UpliftingNews,removed,but at the end of the day they still practice a book that says gays should be killed soooo
UpliftingNews,removed,i think its more sick that this guy killed of our brothers and sisters in the name of islam and you are still defending islam mind boggling oh but there are good islamist and muslims yes there are but even the good ones still swear allegiance to a book and god that says gays must be stoned or burned so what do you want do you want muslims and islamists or do you want men and woman free to be homosexual because you cant have both
UpliftingNews,removed,httpsislimgbldppxjpg
UpliftingNews,removed,money doesnt make up for the fact that you teach your children that homosexuals are evil in your gods eyes funeral bills arent the problem that needs to be fixed the teaching of islamic values is the problem
UpliftingNews,removed,so im showing a muslim scholar promoting the death of homosexuals in a mosque and yet you will still pretend theres nothing wrong with slam sharia law is also some incorrect interpretation right all those woman and homosexual stoned to death in pakistan iran saudi arabia etc are just some muslims
UpliftingNews,removed,jesus the bodies arent even cold yet and you are running promuslim propaganda here
UpliftingNews,removed,that shooter had as much to do with islam as isis meaning exactly nothing
UpliftingNews,removed,oh whoops front page with only a few upvotes amazing praise be to allen and the sky snackbar or trump is going to be the president and the time for honoring yourselves will be at an end
UpliftingNews,removed,islam is the worst thing to happen to the modern world islam is a fucking cancer and this whitewashing attempt is disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,i assumed that people are intelligent enough to realise that things like its definitely not homophobic nor does it perpetuate misogyny and people are just upvoting negative sentiments by chance that they will understand that it is sarcasm and i have been mostly right except for you
UpliftingNews,removed,hahaha i saw this same comment from you earlier today get off of reddit ya sjw
UpliftingNews,removed,you are too far gone my friend
UpliftingNews,removed,i would refuse it
UpliftingNews,removed,muslims fuck you and your pedophile god muhammad we dont need a fucking muslim bake sale but thanks anyway you slimy fucks can take your savage shitty religion and go somewhere else youre not compatible with the modern world and you are no longer welcome
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel like muslims could literally saw the heads of gay people off while screaming im doing this for allah and people would still fucking defend them disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,we will shortly move to the next phase which is to find a good news story amid the rubble anything will do but best of all is a muslim good news story after paris it was swiftly reported that one of the suicide bombers at stade de france had been turned away by a brave muslim security guard the story whizzed around the world before anyone could check whether it was true it wasnt but people needed it to be not because muslims dont do good deeds but because in the wake of any islamist terrorist attack people need people opposed to the bombers to be muslim and the bombers themselves not to be muslim then the good muslim can represent islam while the bad muslims can be said to have nothing to do with it
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe do some research first islamic extremists have carried out a lot of mass killings to say they carry out all the mass killings is incredibly ignorant
UpliftingNews,removed,oh so now the sandniggers are feeling sorry
UpliftingNews,removed,its pronounced mud slime
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck your religion
UpliftingNews,removed,selfprofessed islamic terrorist commits massacre in a gay nightclub muslims solve the problem by throwing money at the victims
UpliftingNews,removed,go fuck a goat
UpliftingNews,removed,i still feel like this is a slightly bad idea the first time the radicals get wind of this everyone there will likely be decapitated and paraded love the message but the fact that were finding it on reddit is bad news for the people of this town hopefully im wrong but im a realist
UpliftingNews,removed,so how many more shootings bombings rape need to happen before you realize islam isnt a religon of peace
UpliftingNews,removed,every year homosexuals infect others with hivaids these folks better donate on a monthly basis for all the homosexuals that homosexuals are killing
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah because building a wall is beyond our capabilities but removing over million guns from our nation will be a walk in the park youre breaking the only rule this sub has
UpliftingNews,removed,muh muh animulz and fags dead yet no one cries when drone strikes kill innocent little kids
UpliftingNews,removed,i lost a family member to the attacks in orlando and i support trump are you even reading what you are saying dumbass
UpliftingNews,removed,where is he doing that goddamn do you have any reading comprehension at all get your head out of your ass you owe it to your dead brother
UpliftingNews,removed,he runs the power company that has a monopoly in my area he got the nevada public utilities commission to pass a ruling that the power you generate isnt worth as much as the power they sell you if they sell you power at per kilowatthour the power you generate for them is worth per kilowatthour this is in addition to having some of the highest energy rates in the entire nation already the major local casino company is about to pay an exit fee of million think about that they would rather pay dollars than continue to be gouged by nvenergy the only reason id like to go to lunch with him is so i could poison his food fuck that guy
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,bullshit they wanted more money pet donations are covered
UpliftingNews,removed,putting fires out in your homes and lighting others in your hearts
UpliftingNews,removed,and now hes homeless disabled and in debt
UpliftingNews,removed,canada has a buff to tolerance due to the fact that everyones inside and lonely half the year it allows for groups that hate each other everywhere else to go from hated to neutral its pretty op tbh im expecting it will be nerfed in the trump expansion or maybe it will be buffed to counter the great again passive that america is supposed to get
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre gonna stab them especially if they bring pork to the party
UpliftingNews,removed,its a trap
UpliftingNews,removed,gross fuck hobos he should be doing that for foster kids they need it more and are not smelly and on crack
UpliftingNews,removed,not really humanity but religions being tolerant is big news the religion of peace does it peacefully this time
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,and then they kill gays down here in a gay club in florida sad day
UpliftingNews,removed,its a trap
UpliftingNews,removed,i can almost guarantee that these are actually christian converts but in pakistan its illegal to convert from islam its not illegal to be a christian or build churches
UpliftingNews,removed,marvel fans agree batman is awesome
UpliftingNews,removed,quick there was just a massive terror attack on the west from muslim men post some articles of good muslims
UpliftingNews,removed,no im voting for donald trump and all muslims are bad no matter what you tell me
UpliftingNews,removed,its a trap
UpliftingNews,removed,how does this make the front page but the incident that happened in orlando does not
UpliftingNews,removed,you wont see this news on fox or cnn thats for sure
UpliftingNews,removed,posting this doesnt trump the fact that a muslim just killed americans in a gay night club
UpliftingNews,removed,so they can get them all in one place and blow them up
UpliftingNews,removed,thats exactly what the pussy ass op was banking on after the shooting fuck you op
UpliftingNews,removed,stay in your own yard that which conceals the weapons system is part of the weapons system
UpliftingNews,removed,oh gawd stop trying to create this muslims are our friends bullshit they arent they never will be
UpliftingNews,removed,ahhh so this is what made rhe front page instead of the muslim that just killed people interesting but by all means everyone feel good about yourselves
UpliftingNews,removed,its not to late to join the trump train everyone help us uncuck the news media
UpliftingNews,removed,something happened today i come on reddit one of the top stories is a paragraph about a group of alleged muslims allegedly building a church for alleged christians lifes all gravy right
UpliftingNews,removed,why is on the front page its a nice story but not a realistic picture of whats happening around the world where christians and every other religious group are being forced out of majority muslim nations due to discrimination and violence i dont have a dog in the fight im atheist i just find it ridiculous that this would be on the front page given the reality
UpliftingNews,removed,title should just read farmers in the middle east build church for their neighbors that sounds a lot more kind rather than bringing religion into it
UpliftingNews,removed,just makes it easier for the radicals to burn them all at once
UpliftingNews,removed,literally campaigning to improve the image of muslims absolutely disgusting this same pattern happened after the paris attack the cologne incident and the airport bombing a muslim does something the amazing liberal campaign trying to cover it up is unstoppable rnews has basically given up on trying to hide its agenda
UpliftingNews,removed,cool me too
UpliftingNews,removed,still waiting on that new gay night club or a few new skyscrapers
UpliftingNews,removed,pc garbagedownvoted and reported
UpliftingNews,removed,a lot of assumptions in your comment im saying theres a pattern for whenever a massacre happens and the pattern is that liberals are ready with a bunch of good actions prepared for these events ive seen it like times already and they all make the front page
UpliftingNews,removed,confirmed fake
UpliftingNews,removed,faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake gay
UpliftingNews,removed,how the fuck is this on the front page but theyre banning anything related to the orlando shooting because it involves muslims propaganda
UpliftingNews,removed,yea easier to kill once they all gather in a building i guess
UpliftingNews,removed,im an atheist and this offends me can a mod please delete this thread hey it works for muslims so why not give it a shot
UpliftingNews,removed,i say too little too late
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel like this is on the front page just to cover for the terrorist attack that happened
UpliftingNews,removed,wowthe reddit pro muslim agenda is really showing today
UpliftingNews,removed,lol guys doesnt even know how to do his own religion right
UpliftingNews,removed,get this fucking dog shit off the front page
UpliftingNews,removed,then he comes out and kills yeah ok nice so uplifting but srs tho all muslims just as bad as the dude who killed the on the inside they all wanted it to happen
UpliftingNews,removed,one church makes it to the front page but every terrorist attack gets muted by this racist media
UpliftingNews,removed,tbh the bad in life involves americans dead today due to islamic extremism
UpliftingNews,removed,truth is not hate back to your safe space
UpliftingNews,removed,it must be our hate that killed americans today
UpliftingNews,removed,its kinda disingenuous to claim its just one muslim that preaches hate and intolerance and kills people for being different and wages war on unbelievers
UpliftingNews,removed,the dude clearly wanted to make headlines with his actions and then he claimed allegiance to islam but its those dumb americans fault for reading the news or did you want to go through all the other murders committed in the name of allah and the other gods
UpliftingNews,removed,can i infer from all the other muslims that cry for jihad as well or are they off limits too
UpliftingNews,removed,how about the ones who scream death to america and call for jihad how about the thousands fighting in their holy wars right now or the hundreds that get on tv and call for war on america whats the approximate number before i can start generalizing
UpliftingNews,removed,wow story comes out right after mooslem kills people in the us just a coincidence i guess
UpliftingNews,removed,i live across from the club and i barely saw any bodies being taken to hospitals this shooting was fake kinda not deaths
UpliftingNews,removed,islam is the religion of terrorism so theres that
UpliftingNews,removed,so this is on the frontpage meanwhile any mention of the shooter being muslim in rnews is censored and there isnt a single front page post discussing how radical islam just killed people not saying that muslims are bad but there is a serious bias against speaking ill of muslims on this site recently
UpliftingNews,removed,nah youre just a bigot who contributes to the death of americans and your own countrymen by spreading your disease of a religion
UpliftingNews,removed,dude no gay people and women definitely deserve rights what are you even
UpliftingNews,removed,they are good people if they stay the fuck away
UpliftingNews,removed,wow really nice you post this bullshit today amidst all the censorship
UpliftingNews,removed,of course im an infidel
UpliftingNews,removed,theyll do it every time anytime theres a shooting or bombing here or in europe the apologists immediately show up and start upvoting stories like this so that they occupy nearly the same rank on the front page why dont these stories ever show up like that at other times when there hasnt been a terrorist attack though i like this story its timing is highly suspect of apologist bs and pr damage control
UpliftingNews,removed,the propaganda is real
UpliftingNews,removed,herding them into one single location didnt think muslims were a strategic bunch
UpliftingNews,removed,oh wow a reactionary post to seemingly defend muslims i checked this persons post history and thats all they do you havent expressed any fucking sympathy for all the victims who were slaughtered last night youre just trying to quickly point out not all muslims are bad and yet you seemingly show no emotion for all the innocent lives lost last night
UpliftingNews,removed,did they build it so they could bomb it
UpliftingNews,removed,and then blow them up
UpliftingNews,removed,welp thats all the proof we need islam is in fact a religion of peace
UpliftingNews,removed,propagandists
UpliftingNews,removed,islam is a disease
UpliftingNews,removed,oh really because i thought that was the religion that calls for gays and nonbelievers to be executed or am i thinking of a different religion
UpliftingNews,removed,lol of course this was posted with the occurring top story being censored never change reddit
UpliftingNews,removed,right on cue get a propaganda story about islam to the front page muslims are a cancer upon the world and the world needs chemo stat
UpliftingNews,removed,dude people were just fuckin murdered k bud
UpliftingNews,removed,we are closer to wolves than to sheep it seems unwise to deny this
UpliftingNews,removed,why would you serve food to infidels your holy book says to kill them
UpliftingNews,removed,lol people are always posting these supposedly real stories about peaceful muslims after mass shootings by islamists are people this fucking stupid blatant propaganda islam is not your friend islam is not peaceful their religion is inherently toxic and incompatible with modern life the nice moderate muslims you see here are not following the real word of the quran please buy the quran and read it for yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,while this is cute i fully expect this pr stunt to eventually end in ashes and rubble
UpliftingNews,removed,look one of my best friends came from iran and is named mohammed i totally respect the of muslims all i am saying is lets not push an agenda on either side but grieve for these individuals and their families
UpliftingNews,removed,this is on the front page yet theres no mention of the domestic terrorist who claimed allegiance to isis and killed people fuck you reddit im done
UpliftingNews,removed,ok dude calm down

UpliftingNews,removed,this is the mobile version of the website you bastard
UpliftingNews,removed,i honestly think he doesnt understand what satire means its the only thing that explains his bizarre contention
UpliftingNews,removed,says rick miller who is playing the game with his daughter probably not all hes playing with his daughter

UpliftingNews,removed,which mods let us know so we can fucking remove them since apparently you have some inside information that the rest of us dont okay i dont know champ go ask the mods im a mod there too and i also dont fucking get paid really are you an unpaid intern for the hillary campaign i find the constant insinuation highly insulting and is nothing more than a witchhunt thats because its true so you are mod of a subreddits pushing antisanders and antitrump propaganda and pushing prohillary propaganda well if you arent paid then you are a sucker people used to squat on domain names people also squat on subreddits okay not only that pr firms political campaigns etc have employees working on spreading propagandaadsetc on social media okay just because i dont know a specific person who are paid for amazon reviews doesnt mean it isnt going on okay so if you arent paid then go whine to the hillary campaign for being cheap
UpliftingNews,removed,hey man go back to pushing your garbage prohillary propaganda if you arent being paid then you are a worthless unpaid intern or a loser you should kill yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,christ thats a waste of money hopefully they go to a good cause but i really doubt any cause could use that many
UpliftingNews,removed,its a recommendation that you commit suicide im sure everyone in your life has told you this sometime in your life reddit would be fucking better of for sure without your garbage propaganda littering it
UpliftingNews,removed,sweet and quite creepy
UpliftingNews,removed,right would it be too hard to call them all plush toys teddy bears are more or less a specific kind of plush bears named after teddy roosevelt
UpliftingNews,removed,on another note we should stuff a zoo with ape dolls for harambe
UpliftingNews,removed,why not feed it to the fans and volunteers first dafuq
UpliftingNews,removed,okay tough guy
UpliftingNews,removed,did i ask dude fuck off
UpliftingNews,removed,umm excuse me but it sounds like you are purposely misinterpreting my there comment and i refuse to acknowledge your actual question
UpliftingNews,removed,youre a sexist
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure the prostitutes and druggies really appreciated it saves them the trouble of having to spend the money on something else other than drugs
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,so people are paying omr about usd to ship a dog over the ocean amazing that a puppy with a cute face can often get so much more sympathy than human suffering in the same region
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont understand how a parent wouldnt try everything even if it might cause their own death to get their fng baby out of a burning house id be willing to bet a large amount of money that she set that fire how can you just step out for a moment and turn around to realize your house is going up in flames
UpliftingNews,removed,now the mother has years to spend all of it
UpliftingNews,removed,why was she even allowed to fly in her third trimester
UpliftingNews,removed,sponsored ad
UpliftingNews,removed,fucking joke
UpliftingNews,removed,every single word in that quote makes me so fucking angry country borders are an incredibly outdated concept in the modern world and this incident is a great example of why that is what if a baby is born on mars whats their nationality any answer to that is based on political agreements because that whole concept is stupid
UpliftingNews,removed,watch the mom get them all in the divorce and then use them all up with her new boyfriend
UpliftingNews,removed,do you want more babies born on planes because this is how you get more babies born on planes
UpliftingNews,removed,are these people insane incentivizing women to give birth on a plane like theres not already enough delays and screaming babies as it is no we apparently also need e bunch of pregnant women vying for free entry into the club why dont they make it like a black friday sale and offer a free flatscreen while theyre at it
UpliftingNews,removed,am i the only one that thinks the miles should be given to the passengers that had to experience that i mean i get its beautiful and allnew lifebut when i travel on a plane i dont sign up to be in a labor room
UpliftingNews,removed,what if she timed it precisely so she will give birth on a plane and reap the rewards
UpliftingNews,removed,mega miles shouldnt it be mm i have seen b and m used for currency monetary amount before or
UpliftingNews,removed,bad decision by airline will be incentivizing women to fly during late stage pregnancy instead they should have charged the mother for bringing an extra passenger
UpliftingNews,removed,what the bullshit i want million miles the kid didnt even do anything
UpliftingNews,removed,you can fly up to months
UpliftingNews,removed,ughthe smell
UpliftingNews,removed,yes lets encourage extremely pregnant women to fly in hopes theyll give birth inflight and disrupt everyones travel plans with a diverted landing facepalm
UpliftingNews,removed,janitor who had to clean the waterbreakage and afterbirth out of the cloth seats and airplane carpet given absolutely nothing
UpliftingNews,removed,two options here pal a they did but the dogs injuries were too severe and it perished later or b its a fucking dog you prioritize human lives
UpliftingNews,removed,which will burn in a year
UpliftingNews,removed,so much for not flying while youre pregnant
UpliftingNews,removed,you should t be sotting if youre that pregnant
UpliftingNews,removed,was she trying to anchor baby or why would she go on a flight when shes due any day
UpliftingNews,removed,shes from dubai i assume probably just paid them off to let her fly and if shes from the philippines they dont have as strict flying guidelines as the us
UpliftingNews,removed,i think if i was on that plan id like some air miles too just sayin
UpliftingNews,removed,theres this thing called jokes also apostrophes but we can work our way up to it overly hostile dick
UpliftingNews,removed,well million air miles in year when shes able to redeem it will be worth approximiately
UpliftingNews,removed,could you imagine the horror of being a passenger on there it is bad enough being on a plane with a baby that is screaming but being on a plane with a screaming mother giving birth to a screaming baby christ
UpliftingNews,removed,hahahahahhahahah dog got fucking rekt lmao roast dog for dinner
UpliftingNews,removed,im not so sure how nice story will turn out doctors generally advise not to travel especially flying i knew a lady that flew hours while pregnant and ended up premature birth and eventually loss the baby due to health issues not saying the traveling was the cause but it certainly doesnt help anything
UpliftingNews,removed,why do they let a month pregnant woman on a plane do you think it is fair to the other passengers that you pay for an airline ticket and then be sitting close to a passenger that has blood and after birth everywhere if i was a passenger on this plane i would ask for a refund
UpliftingNews,removed,million air miles for nothing nice i would love to get million air miles for doing fucking nothing not uplifting just making me feel like an unlucky sod
UpliftingNews,removed,who cares about the baby the dog died
UpliftingNews,removed,weeks early god damn put it back in its not ready baby is really going to need that air miles being as it will be retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,it was over my head for a minute
UpliftingNews,removed,those jewish pigs should be sent to the ovens again
UpliftingNews,removed,they should really stop reporting stuff like this as news especially when so much important stuff is happening around the world that goes unreported
UpliftingNews,removed,hmm will your insurance cover your dollar legs or instead force you to use a dollar wheelchair
UpliftingNews,removed,i wasnt moved the five other times i have seen this posted op is a bundle of sticks
UpliftingNews,removed,i see what you did there i guess we should just hash it lol anyway smoking pot might be on the rise but if we are responsible we can try to move the culture towards vaping
UpliftingNews,removed,good thing it wasnt a white cop would have shot the kid times in self defense of course

UpliftingNews,removed,but no one uses it its hard to get something that requires a decent user base off the ground also i dont think the system is particularly effective but that is just my opinion
UpliftingNews,removed,dont it doesnt worn that well because no one uses it
UpliftingNews,removed,too bad it doesnt work that well
UpliftingNews,removed,possibly but i doubt it most efforts to prevent bullying lead to harder hitting methods of bullying source im in highschool and i get bullied
UpliftingNews,removed,i love u
UpliftingNews,removed,the tall mildy downs girl is going to grow up to be the hottest downs woman ever
UpliftingNews,removed,thats retarded

UpliftingNews,removed,i hope they keep a close eye on the dogs so the prisoners dont rape them
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck prison labor
UpliftingNews,removed,httparticlepaperscomliveinthemoment
UpliftingNews,removed,just what rape victims need more government imposing laws on them laws are the reason theyre in that position to be begin with
UpliftingNews,removed,it was all from this animal rescue show i watched i counted and at least half of the animals they rescued they put down and realistically most shelters put down adult animals after days im getting downvoted to hell for remembering a sad fact oh well people want to imagine everything has a happy ending dont we all feel uplifted by this news
UpliftingNews,removed,these dogs are getting national coverage my brother in law is driving up there from virginia to look at the dogs when theyre available theyll be fine
UpliftingNews,removed,the fact that hes still pandering the farfarleft political agenda on his show i still find plenty of reasons to hate him
UpliftingNews,removed,john oliver pays insurance corporation for useless asset
UpliftingNews,removed,trump has somehow managed to do that several times
UpliftingNews,removed,now if only he could buy some good jokes
UpliftingNews,removed,he is a cuck because he doesnt want someone to come turn your life upside down over a debt that you legally dont have to pay you dont find it ridiculous that for bucks he started a company that can literally screw with peoples lives illegally if your upset that he tore into your messiah over trump university thats all good but you people in thedonald have been crying about the truth well here it is and you are still crying
UpliftingNews,removed,relevant httpsyoutubecomwatchvczajydpyyq
UpliftingNews,removed,look at me and how fast i got upvotes
UpliftingNews,removed,no it was uncollectable debt and i have been clear on that and the article is clear on that as well the only way the debt could be collected is if the person gets tricked into making even a token payment on the debt they are still not safe from this as this bad paper as it is called in the industry is often in the hands of multiple debtcollection agencies so he bought one copy of a list when many copies exist he has saved no one and nobody other than the debt collector who sold him the list for and is laughing his ass off at john oliver i am sure debt collectors across the country are having a good chuckle today the only upshot here is that apparently five or six of you learned what reaffirming debt means today
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah fuck the most innovative and successful health care system in the history of humanity because it isnt all handed to a cry baby like you for free
UpliftingNews,removed,it must be nice to live life being such a selfish cunt will you think the same if you lose your job and get cancer and cant afford to feed your children
UpliftingNews,removed,im not saying youre a retard youre just not not a retard

UpliftingNews,removed,i hate this guy and i hate how the left plays with people
UpliftingNews,removed,the problem with paying for poor people is that poor people are naturally irresponsible and this teaches them nothing most of those people will find themselves right back in debt
UpliftingNews,removed,then mocks sanders so fuck him
UpliftingNews,removed,just dont show rthedonald the segment where they dig in to the released trump university documents the ones where they teach their sales people to prey on poor single women
UpliftingNews,removed,trump lovers must be angry

UpliftingNews,removed,no references to moms spaghetti i am disappointed
UpliftingNews,removed,it also is a very nazi sounding name
UpliftingNews,removed,actually as lovely s story as it is and ad much as i loved it it was found out that they lied about meeting in a camp and the book he wrote about it was actually changed from non fiction to fiction when it was found out
UpliftingNews,removed,nazis the most efficient matchmakers in the world
UpliftingNews,removed,jews jews everywhere
UpliftingNews,removed,reddit love this cheer me up stories but the reality of every day even if you find the one is brutal
UpliftingNews,removed,the opposite of what happened to my great grandparents great grandfather was imprisoned by the nazis for refusing to collaborate with them and his wife was denied medicine resulting in blindness that lasted the rest of her life both never recovered it must have been tricky for their three children
UpliftingNews,removed,serious question how big is he im so not trying to be a dick but instead provedisprove a theorystereotype

UpliftingNews,removed,my take away from this is that if you have full lips good cheek bones and a strong chin youll still be pretty after youre being treated for cancer which means im just going to be a short bald man completely lacking in body hair with no lips a weak chin and poor cheek bones so poor even tiny tim would feel sorry for me god i really hope i dont have cancer my hair and beard are the only things i have drawing enough attention away from my face to make me attractive
UpliftingNews,removed,kinda shitty history tbh
UpliftingNews,removed,looking through your post history it sounds like you had kids and an already very full life when you went through your chemo but thats completely different than the experiences and priorities of a young teenage girl going through chemo dont you think simply put for some people spending hours doing makeup might create a welcome distraction from chemo and the overall shittiness of their situation and its pretty unfair to act like thats somehow inferior or worthless its almost like different people have different hobbies that they take comfort in
UpliftingNews,removed,common practice to use when your account focuses on makeup they do it so they dont get a ton of comments asking what theyre using has nothing to do with sponsors
UpliftingNews,removed,god bless you in the name of jesus i stand on the word of god isaiah by the strips of jesus you are healed🙏🏽
UpliftingNews,removed,i could see how people who dont wear makeup would think thats a lot products if not that much
UpliftingNews,removed,slow clap
UpliftingNews,removed,rroastme
UpliftingNews,removed,i wasnt mocking shes just a very naturally attractive person it kinda mutes the message of you can be pretty without hair when shed be attractive in burlap sack
UpliftingNews,removed,as a woman i am not judging the fact that another woman enjoys using make up cancer or not this thread insulting a woman for liking to wear makeup is pathetic yet everyone is getting upvotes
UpliftingNews,removed,thats the number of products people use for a basic face typically as well i dont know why so many people who dont know shit about makeup feel the needs to comment on it in the thread also its a fucking photoshoot of course theyre going to use a lot of products
UpliftingNews,removed,holy fucking shit what in your life has made you such an awful person what does the list of makeup products have to do with her personality
UpliftingNews,removed,hoping the end of chemoreturn of hair means remission i wish you well nothing saddens me more than young people being laid low by cancer also curly mops can be adorable if you wear it with sass
UpliftingNews,removed,i cant believe the number of people on this thread who have no clue what a cancer patient is feeling yet are completely shitting on this girl and this story confidence helps any positivity helps in the face of cancer this story would have uplifted my mom if she saw it fuck all the haters in this thread they dont know what theyre saying
UpliftingNews,removed,thought that was a barbie someone took the hair off of that lighting sucks make her look plasric
UpliftingNews,removed,or expressions or recognizable humanity or reality of any kind
UpliftingNews,removed,itt insecure unsocial fucks are upset that an attractive girl is getting attention besides she has cancer
UpliftingNews,removed,rmakeupfetish
UpliftingNews,removed,products is not really a lot at all
UpliftingNews,removed,its really not very few make up artists and models are able to get sponsorship and get paid for endorsements but almost all of them include a product list with their looks they list products because people are going to ask and they bitch if you dont include them
UpliftingNews,removed,since the two of you are exactly the same people with exactly the same experiences and interests i can see why that is relevant not
UpliftingNews,removed,cant spell believe without lie were all screwed
UpliftingNews,removed,he means that it will when it kills her
UpliftingNews,removed,jesus christ people she was a model and she just wants to keep doing what makes her happy what a bunch of assholes you all are for shitting on her for it if she was doing something you deemed noteworthy like athletics or academics youd all trip all over yourselves to praise her unfortunately she enjoys modeling so shes basically a kardashian
UpliftingNews,removed,shes definitely a video game character ive seen her kind before
UpliftingNews,removed,it says she beat the cancer anyways youd think the advice would be somewhat meaningful or existential but instead its the most superficial message possible dying of cancer and life got you down well its ok cuz look at my eye makeup hashtag attentionwhore
UpliftingNews,removed,jesus christ you keep posting the same thing in this thread after about the third time i just dont get it so she wants to continue modeling because it makes her happy and shes not letting cancer beat her you have done the same thing with your passions this isnt a cancer contest
UpliftingNews,removed,i wish my pores are the size of pluto i wish someone would kick them out too
UpliftingNews,removed,christ you sound jealous
UpliftingNews,removed,whats wrong with pornstars
UpliftingNews,removed,i cant tell if theres airbrushing here or not it seems like she has a light powder all over that can be blended just fine like around where her blush ends i just dont understand why everything is applied so thick sharp her eyebrows and eyeshadow would be much lovelier softened in either photo unless thats the look she wants i guess thats a look
UpliftingNews,removed,its a good thing shes doing the makeup for her and not you then isnt it
UpliftingNews,removed,how dare she do something that makes her feel better she should have asked you for your imput first
UpliftingNews,removed,this is an awfully rude commentdont down someone for using different ways than you would to feel happy this subreddit is about happiness shared by others not downing the forms of happiness please think of others and what you say and how she would feel if she saw this
UpliftingNews,removed,wasnt the point of her message that woman can be beautiful without hair are you going to say its smoke and mirrors because she is also wearing clothes a lot of women who lose their hair struggle with horribly looking and itchy wigs because its still taboo for woman to be hairless i say good for her and brave of her to do this
UpliftingNews,removed,thats kinda what you do in a professional model shoot shes was a model before cancer so this is just her getting back on the horse if she was doing something you deemed worthy like athletics or academics youd be flailing to praise her but since shes just a model youre shitting on her
UpliftingNews,removed,shes a model having a photoshoot this is the kind of makeup all models use for photoshoots
UpliftingNews,removed,rule number one of this subreddit dont be a dick
UpliftingNews,removed,i like my women like i like my wine over a hundred years oldripe and fragrant licks lips
UpliftingNews,removed,showing true face of cancer is good showing that a bald sick girl can still look beautiful is also good why one or the other
UpliftingNews,removed,what message maybe that you can still feel confident and beautiful in the face of cancer this subreddit is about sharing happiness positivity and inspiration remember rule number one dont be a dick
UpliftingNews,removed,jesus those eye brows
UpliftingNews,removed,would not fuck holy shit she looks like an alien
UpliftingNews,removed,still gross
UpliftingNews,removed,would hit
UpliftingNews,removed,ewww gross looks like a dude yuck
UpliftingNews,removed,she is beautiful i think the makeup seems a bit much but would lick her head from front to back
UpliftingNews,removed,what pamela geller is stating here is the most serious and eyeopening information you will find anywhere in fact you wont find it on the mainstream media news at all but it must be heard and it must be acknowledged its really that serious we are living in a time that people cant even imagine just as we couldnt imagine what the nazis did in wwll but its here its really here its fact not fiction anymore
UpliftingNews,removed,no actually i have one bad arm and dont type all that well when my left arm is tired dont set yourself on fire it has a bad effect on your future muscle control
UpliftingNews,removed,cancer cant stop me being a princess not yet
UpliftingNews,removed,teenager with cancer that i like to fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,get a wig and move on no one fucking cares about your bald head
UpliftingNews,removed,the rape kit backlog is a proof of sexual intercourse kit backlog they pile up when its a settled matter of law based on admission from the accused that sexual contact took place and no longer requires dna evidence to prove it but since theyve been given a very headline grabbing title people think the kits are not being prioritized based on the cases involved and so uninformed people think there is a pressing value to spend or in this case donate large sums of money for useless outdated evidence in cases settled long ago
UpliftingNews,removed,she also posted on her facebook that she thought the police shootings in dallas were fake to get people to side with the cops while officers were being shot on live tv so
UpliftingNews,removed,really pisses me off when people assume all rapists are men
UpliftingNews,removed,get real dude not a single rape kit has a female preparator
UpliftingNews,removed,i still doubt anything will come of it beyond oh a celebrity really helped things the kits are likely useless at this point in a great number of cases not only that but processing them is only a part of the ongoing cases in each situation following that its enforcement and courts it will plug up again guaranteed sorry to be a cynic but celebrities or not i dont put a lot of stock into the whole idea that rapes will be prosecuted to the highest degree its been shown that for the most part no they arent
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe if the women that were raped provided solid evidence it would be taken seriously
UpliftingNews,removed,source or gtfo because according to in tfa the backlog includes stranger rape cases
UpliftingNews,removed,women rape too you know
UpliftingNews,removed,starting in in detroit you have to pay for the inner city kids college also state funded free college what a nice government we have handing out all of my money
UpliftingNews,removed,how about you shut your corrupt government the fuck down your forefathers killed so you would have the right to own guns to defend yourselves from this exact shit its easier to talk about it when it isnt directly happening to you though right america the land of people who talk the talk but are too fat lazy and stupid to walk the walk
UpliftingNews,removed,thats way too expensive i have a rape kit in the trunk of my car that was less than though to be fair i already owned the ski mask and duct tape
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont think hes saying females cant rape the odds that a male rape victim will report are slim the odds of him being taken seriously are slimmer the odds of him being taken seriously to get a rape kit are even slimmer than that the odds of that rape kit being tested and pursued to conviction you might as well buy a lotto ticket
UpliftingNews,removed,thats awesome

UpliftingNews,removed,love it when someone walks the talk
UpliftingNews,removed,if i charged you to listen to me shriek into a microphone about racial division and white power and then donated of profits to rape kits the headline would read evil white power activist preaching hateful rhetoric not stcj donating concert proceeds to clear detroit rapekit backlog but come out with one hit song in the early and preach about black power reiterating ignorant and untrue views and youre a hero yawn why are you knuckleheads engaging in free public relations for this talentless hack stop the circle jerc
UpliftingNews,removed,well everything is rape these days thanks feminists
UpliftingNews,removed,t affluent people benefit in one way or another from a society in which a minority of the people possess a majority of the wealth thus keeping education shitty keeps the proletariat in their place at the bottom keeps the status quo the way they like it i think youd be surprised to hear it but it is true money in education is irrelevant there have been dozens of studies since the showing that even though the worst performing school districts in the united states have been employing robin hood tactics taking rich district tax money and injecting it into the lowest performing schools the bad schools continue to get worse some of these detroit schools are overfunded in comparison to a rich suburban school by almost three fold using words like proletariat and thinking of the lower class as held down by the upper class is sophomoric and willfully ignorant the actuality of events is you cannot change familial structure and communal norms of blacks in by injecting additional money into the public school system the last years proves this in order of importance the problem is at home with the degradation of the black nuclear family the problem is cultural and subaverage intelligent quotients certainly do not help the situation
UpliftingNews,removed,you can put together a good rape kit for very little at walmart rope duct tape condoms leavenotrace a knife flashlight screwdriver and a satchel you probably already own most of this stuff

UpliftingNews,removed,you are the reason people who extreme coupon have such a bad rap store policy trumps what is written on that coupon and it is completely up to our discretion whether we override it or not rather then checkout and bring your problem to customer service youre going to stand in line and cause a scene making everyone behind you wait because you are paying cents more than you should on items you are probably going to resell on facebook groups
UpliftingNews,removed,well shes helping herself too obviously shes fat as fuck haha am i right
UpliftingNews,removed,we hate you sincerely reddit
UpliftingNews,removed,why such news does not come from most of the european countries
UpliftingNews,removed,the last time i saw someone couponing was in a cvs and these two guys were trying to use an expired coupon to get off a bag of candy or something the manager had to threaten to call the police because they wouldnt leave when she told them they couldnt use it and then they called her a bitch real nice guys
UpliftingNews,removed,isnt that kind of like ripping off the store
UpliftingNews,removed,and black to good for her
UpliftingNews,removed,she probably steals their identity and sells it to the cartels for a piece of the drug smuggling profits
UpliftingNews,removed,looks like she used those coupons to feed herself pretty good as well
UpliftingNews,removed,blacklivesthatmatter
UpliftingNews,removed,in need in need to get off their asses stop doing drugs and get a job
UpliftingNews,removed,this is such a waste of time jesus
UpliftingNews,removed,reminder coupon fraud is a felony
UpliftingNews,removed,so she steals from the grocery stores how does that help
UpliftingNews,removed,nj woman uses coupons to take advantage of grocery stores good will causes stock to be depleted for everyone else forces the store to redo their coupon policy probably even causes them to raise prices at least the homeless got something out of it
UpliftingNews,removed,thats a lot of effort for some pussaaaaayyyyyy
UpliftingNews,removed,how does your value judgment of another persons value judgment matter who are you to judge the significance and validity of someones response to something the onemillion dollar scoreboard contributes much more to the world than your disgust does and the money wasted on a sub par purchase contributes more to the economy than a well reasoned protest of that acquisition if it holds no power or sway but it doesnt make the principle behind it wrong or the argument that it could be better spent incorrect
UpliftingNews,removed,trust me she sucked a lot of dick for this it wasnt free
UpliftingNews,removed,who cares how you feel obviously one cares how one feels about ones own perception of things but if you mean to say that we should never ever bother to ever have a negative thought or critical attitude toward the behavior of people who are withing their rights to act miserably then i dont see your point either our values are found in counterpoints to behavior and values we disagree with we are also living in a society so we judge and evaluate the actions taken by others we find it miserable to think that people would betray or waste the gift of their parents or laud them when they do something we find agreeable thats basic human society there thats how you know what kind of tribe you belong to and who you share your values with by observing what you disagree with and find disagreeable whats more were not just talking about people who have nothing to do with us this happens to be about a public university wasting money that was given in good faith i happen to think that since a university particularly a public one is a communal entity that exists to serve the broader needs of society then we can be perfectly reasonable when we criticize them or judge their values

UpliftingNews,removed,i could win an award like that but i dont feel like putting on pants
UpliftingNews,removed,probably had to do so because the school couldnt afford a translator
UpliftingNews,removed,that schoolboy sounds pretty gay to me seems like the only reason he learned sign language is to tell the deaf classmate if he wants to fuck him in the asshole he seems to really enjoy getting his rectum destroyed by a imbecile deaf retard who might aswell have downs syndrome fucking commies
UpliftingNews,removed,we had about people learn in my scool wheres my humanity award i wish id have stayed at that school bc it would be an awesome skill to still have i was when i learned

UpliftingNews,removed,inside edition makes me sick but michael vick and his shitbag homies make me even sicker dont care what hes done to improve his standing in life he will always be killer of mans best friend an unforgivable offense
UpliftingNews,removed,no doubt not all pit bulls are dangerous killers but those that are represent a disproportionate number of all dangerous dogs i have seen pit bulls attack and i for one dont want them anywhere near people source ready set downvote
UpliftingNews,removed,ive said this before but an aggressive dog is a fearful dog those dogs fighting in rings are terrified for their lives the punishment for such an atrocious act should be being put in a pit with another person who was convicted of the same crime and having them fight to the death so they know the fear they instilled on one of the only animals on this planet who is our species soulmate
UpliftingNews,removed,michael vick is a piece of shit
UpliftingNews,removed,statistically yes most deaths from dog attacks are from a pit bulls also the most permanent and disfiguring damages
UpliftingNews,removed,seconded really reignited my passion for volunteering with animals and reminded me of what a fucking monster michael vick was to those poor pups to this day i cannot believe he was allowed to get a dog again despite the public knowledge of his vicktory dogs
UpliftingNews,removed,idono about that i dont wish death upon no one
UpliftingNews,removed,lol people on dont leave their houses
UpliftingNews,removed,never forget michael vick is the scum of the earth
UpliftingNews,removed,pit bull saved from michael vicks dog fighting ring this is impossible pit bull cannot ever fight in a ring they are far too docile for that ive even read that of pits are not aggressive and cannot harm a fly yes s
UpliftingNews,removed,i just read this a while ago suppose it could be wrong httpwwwdogsbiteorgdangerousdogspitbullfaqphp
UpliftingNews,removed,i just read this a while ago suppose it could be wrong httpwwwdogsbiteorgdangerousdogspitbullfaqphp
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck you michael vick
UpliftingNews,removed,an abused pit bull raised exclusively for fighting will cuddle with some kittens and people still think that pits raised by loving families might be aggressive because fuck logic amirite
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel like people have already forgotten how shit a person michael vick is
UpliftingNews,removed,god gave us dominion over all animals we are allowed to raise them in deplorable conditions and eat them we can catch them and train them to do all kinds of amusing things for us we can make them work at jobs to make our life easier we can test medicines on them to make sure theyre safe for us mrvick should be held in no lower esteem than anyone else who participates or supports any of these other activities
UpliftingNews,removed,amazing what lengths people go to for a dog yet well completely ignore the plight of other humans i bet homeless people and starving children in the third world really appreciate videos like this also i would totally buy my dog a sundae before i gave a homeless man a dollar why is that
UpliftingNews,removed,obligatory michael vick rant he did his time is a copout theoretically vick could have been sentenced to a weekend in jail and probation does that mean we could say he did his time he hasnt done crap for antidog fighting organizations since then unless you include courtmandated stuff and a couple of photo ops with the gullible president of the humane society in every interview since then vick has made himself out to be the victim he deserves a second chance after note not for the squeamish some people are ready to beatify vick because hes managed to go a few years without throwing any family pets into a pit to be torn to shreds thats not rehabilitation thats trying to keep ones ass out of prison f him f the eagles f the jets f the steelers and f anyone who thinks that this sociopathic monster belongs anywhere other than in a cage covered in barbecue sauce surrounded by a dozen pit bulls who havent eaten in a week
UpliftingNews,removed,why isnt michael vick dead
UpliftingNews,removed,going out on a limb hes blaming vick for being the type of piece of shit that would be capable of this sort of thing in the first place who really gives a shit about his aww shucks ya got me penance rings a bit hollow after participating and facilitating blood sport
UpliftingNews,removed,here we go blood pressure at again the fucking nigger needs to have his dick cut off shoved up his ass hung and then his body ground up for dog chow
UpliftingNews,removed,just wondering where you are getting your stats aside from a quick wikipedia search bar any research i do indicates i am correct in that the most deaths are caused by pitbulls you could just say you like the breed
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck him get off his dick
UpliftingNews,removed,and michael vick is still in the nfl let that sink in
UpliftingNews,removed,if you really read about what he did the fact that he fell on his sword to save his own ass doesnt prove anything he is a horrible disgusting amoral excuse for a human his redemption in the public eye only shows how we worship the rich and powerful like a bunch of pussies if someone opens fire in a mcdonalds we dont forgive them because the type of person who would commit a stunningly horrible and antisocial act is not redeemable hes a monster
UpliftingNews,removed,alright fuckers sit down and buckle up because im tired of going through and trying to explain to you ignorant assholes why you shouldnt still be mad at michael vick almost a decade later let me start by saying of course what vick did was a horrible disgusting thing and he absolutely deserved to be punished and as we all know he was punished with the maximum allowable sentence his first press conference after conviction felt very forced it was very much a shit i got caught type apology however since he was released he has been nothing short of a model citizen community leader and human being he has gone to capital hill to help pass new legislation in dealing with animal cruelty crimes he has donated countless time effort and money to various animal rights groups i understand saying that what vick did was wrong but to continue saying hes still a piece of shit after showing a genuine change in his life makes you the piece of shit for not having enough compassion and understand to forgive a man who knows he made a mistake and has done as much as humanly possible to correct that mistake
UpliftingNews,removed,you dont turn from a horrible person into an angel he has no character and all the posturing hes doing to benefit himself doesnt change that
UpliftingNews,removed,give me a fucking break people do not change their basic character
UpliftingNews,removed,the new season of bojack horseman mr peanutbutter a dog says something like i just got a call from michael vick with some kind of strange offer
UpliftingNews,removed,you sound like you know him personally do you
UpliftingNews,removed,might as well call it the faggot scouts hopefully this kind of trash ends up dissapeared during camping trips
UpliftingNews,removed,ugh
UpliftingNews,removed,so girls can now join the boy scouts was i supposed to start clapping or something
UpliftingNews,removed,not cool kids are constantly flip flopping on trendy issues we really shouldnt be taking alternate gender identities seriously with them sixteen at the earliest is when this should be taken seriously this with kids so young is just sick
UpliftingNews,removed,they arent boys though is that really the correct age to know for sure if the mental situation isnt reversible yet
UpliftingNews,removed,these are fucking kids with a ton of hormones in their body no matter what they say they are are they have a vagina and the skeletal structure of a female im all for not giving a shit about what people do but this is a little far
UpliftingNews,removed,was really hoping for more positivity from a place called uplifting news
UpliftingNews,removed,mm
UpliftingNews,removed,but they arent boys
UpliftingNews,removed,itt not uplifting comments
UpliftingNews,removed,thingscouts
UpliftingNews,removed,this male in the brain stuff is unsubstantiated bulshit
UpliftingNews,removed,hey troop were going camping this weekend dont forget your hat your backpack your pocket knife and your tampons
UpliftingNews,removed,they cant drink nor smoke but can undergo a sex change interesting
UpliftingNews,removed,what the fuck transgender boys as in underage why are we normalising this bullshit kids this young shouldnt be thinking about things like sexual identity and nobody should be have to view children in such a way they dont have the capacity to understand what it means to say im trans all theyre able to connect is that itll get them some extra attention if a prepubescent child wants to identify as trans they and their parents should be very thoroughly investigated for signs of abuse the average year old doesnt just have a gender identity crisis all on their own im willing to bet that in of cases there is parental influence playing a part that is so unbelievably fucked up
UpliftingNews,removed,youre full of shit you lgbt groupie faggots are the trolls
UpliftingNews,removed,its really sad thatvan organisation i loved is cavibg into this pseudoscience garbage the bsa is irredeemable now my kids will never be scouts
UpliftingNews,removed,yay postmodernism woohoo objective truth is nonsense
UpliftingNews,removed,who the fuck made you a scoutmaster your backward ass would have bere removed from my troop so fast your head would spin you are poisening these young boys minds and undetmining the key idea of the bsa that masculinity is a duty not a choice i wouldnt be suprised if half those boys turn into dandys under your eye
UpliftingNews,removed,america really is falling to pieces
UpliftingNews,removed,gender dysphoria is at best a mental illness and at worst a fucking joke you should look up the origin of the word gender and its creator a guy by the name john money created it and systematically triedvto prove the existence of gender by forcing children into false sexuality and making siblings have sex with eachother this marxist bullshit is what you people are espousing
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting the whole premise is gross and depressing
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont know whats more disgusting people letting their kids become trans or the boy scouts allowing these misguided children in
UpliftingNews,removed,sounds like they are girls to me
UpliftingNews,removed,boys should not have to worry about transgender kids joining the bsa if youre not biologically make from birth you shouldnt be able to join the bsa
UpliftingNews,removed,sounds like what you are saying is puberty causes children to grow out of stupid and ignorant childish bullshit gee god forbid we let nature take its course lets just butcher these kids genetals and turn them into maimed freaks instead i am sure that is great for the psychological stability there was a time when people raised their kids and taught them not to be retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,genetics would say otherwise
UpliftingNews,removed,no they could not until now
UpliftingNews,removed,please explain the actual science behind this brain shit you people always quote ps there is none
UpliftingNews,removed,stats show that roughly of trans gender people have thought about suicide i only ever thought about suicide after people started treating me like shit for being transgender there is no inherent suicide risk in being transgender
UpliftingNews,removed,lets make sure pence doesnt hear about this
UpliftingNews,removed,you know if you standing in traffic an oncoming car isnt relevant if you just pretend it doesnt exist
UpliftingNews,removed,i said born with dumbass
UpliftingNews,removed,phobia an extreme or irrational fear
UpliftingNews,removed,as an eagle scout fuck this shit make your own coed scouts oh wait theres venturing or make your own freak show scouts with dishonest mentally ill people like rachel dolezal and talcum x
UpliftingNews,removed,a lot of parents push for it nowadays its crazy how when most of these kids have no sense of gender identity their parents convince them they want it done so they dont go through normal puberty
UpliftingNews,removed,are you an idiot no need for masculinity thats like saying there is no need for god in church or no need for peices in a chess club the entire fucking point of boy scouts is to nurture masculinity have you ever heard of baden powell cause you dont seem to understand his message what gagglefuck of dipshit parents put you in charge of a troop
UpliftingNews,removed,thats a massive oversimplification fucking every civic organisation is about growth dumbfuck
UpliftingNews,removed,this is antithetical to the boy scouts its not discriminatory its just the nature of what they teach
UpliftingNews,removed,tell those lab experiments to go back into the dungeon they came from
UpliftingNews,removed,there is a difference between gender and sex you fucking dim shithead
UpliftingNews,removed,nothing uplifting about forcing healthy boys to interact with the mentally ill
UpliftingNews,removed,thank you for acting and behaving like a true scout some of the people here claiming to be eagle scouts makes me wonder if they ever truly believes in the scout law
UpliftingNews,removed,the conservative tears are delicious
UpliftingNews,removed,seriously there needs to be a point in which mental illness stops being considered the new norm
UpliftingNews,removed,catering to mentally distressed and confused kids with insane parents is not forward progress as an eagle myself i have no doubt that the scouts guidelines could use a nice little updating sure but this to me is more disturbing then improving things these kids and their parents need helpnot to be coddled and told everything is going to be ok when it really isnt
UpliftingNews,removed,except the part where they are female yeah
UpliftingNews,removed,because a child cant make that kind of life altering decision
UpliftingNews,removed,its not ok for other people to have their own opinions its been shown time and time again that trans is a mental state and not physical being trans isnt ok its a sign that something is mentally wrong with that person we shouldnt celebrate that
UpliftingNews,removed,are you asking me to explain why i think we shouldnt teach children that theyve been born wrong are you ok
UpliftingNews,removed,western civilization crumbles further
UpliftingNews,removed,force their children into normative gender roles the fuck being trans isnt some genetic issue its a mental issue theyre the ones really suffering from abusive parents
UpliftingNews,removed,supporting a mental illness is wrong which is what this is doing
UpliftingNews,removed,right they dont even understand sexuality yet let alone what its really like to be a man woman i blame the greedy doctors as much as i blame the hipster progressive parents
UpliftingNews,removed,because its bonkers mental problems at that age need some serious help
UpliftingNews,removed,she is still fat
UpliftingNews,removed,change the title to fake news kids its a temporary ban on seven countries for days i believe with syria being longer term this article is miss information at its best and tries to fly under the fact radar straight to your feelings its just bullshit flavored bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,i know india has a long way to go but i think theyre going to take over as the leader of the free world largest democracy in the planet and the us is going to hell in a handbasket while india seems to be making real progrssive progress
UpliftingNews,removed,andrew breitbarts heart failure and shapiros leaving ruined breitbart news as a worthwhile news source i now see it somewhere between buzzfeed and huffington post and that is sad

UpliftingNews,removed,and illegal aliens living in tennessee
UpliftingNews,removed,the poster is absolutely correct he may not be fun at parties but i bet his finances are in better order than yours

UpliftingNews,removed,us milky milk milkmilk
UpliftingNews,removed,this is pathetic
UpliftingNews,removed,mine too but its confusing because while youd expect to find it in the dairy section its always over with the sausages
UpliftingNews,removed,in other news the cno is making every attempt to transform the navy from an elite fighting force into a joke because we didnt already know
UpliftingNews,removed,saw this on facebook and people noted that milk was in a relationship with an intimate relationship year old when he himself was in his i know on reddit it will get some so whats but it is kinda creepy is it someone that should really have their name be put on a ship
UpliftingNews,removed,let us hope she is launched with sufficient lube oils
UpliftingNews,removed,harvey milk can we drink him
UpliftingNews,removed,finally surrounded by seamen hed love it
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,anyone else find it ironic that the uss harvey milk will be an oiler when they pull up itll be this is harvey milk were coming up from your rear and were hauling tons of lube
UpliftingNews,removed,somethingsomething its not gay if youre underway
UpliftingNews,removed,how can you object to this when an aircraft carrier is named after an actor who didnt serve in the easiest to justify war in recent history milk was a vet reagan was a chicken hawk before you say reagan was president there are plenty of presidents without ships named after them
UpliftingNews,removed,its a pitcher not a catcher
UpliftingNews,removed,wasnt he a rear admiral
UpliftingNews,removed,wouldnt have happened if it was any other type of rights he was fighting for lmao gay culture shoved down your throats boys

UpliftingNews,removed,thats irrelevant to the argument is that like your motto or something you keep saying completely unrelated things over and over again
UpliftingNews,removed,imagine if you married someone who had work like that done and then your kids ended up looking just like the before picture
UpliftingNews,removed,modern medicine our research is based on evidence and testing we now have more than a prayer to offer even the most serious conditions

UpliftingNews,removed,i think people get furries mixed up with people that are genuinely into beastiality although i dont like furries i am not going to judge them for their sexual behavior if you wanna bang my pug though we have an issue
UpliftingNews,removed,as a furry this makes me feel much safer
UpliftingNews,removed,tbh my uncle was a furry and i think it would have been a lot better for everyone of he had died in that fire i would have at least saved a lot on counselling
UpliftingNews,removed,i carry a puppy with me when i break into cars for just this reason

UpliftingNews,removed,i was great friends with a girl who had a similar surgery in high school she was one of us nerdy unpopular kids before the surgery less than a year after she became beautiful she would barely talk to us and was banging the jocks
UpliftingNews,removed,what if the windows are tinted and i reasonably suspect either a child or pet within
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah she is now but before the surgeries there wouldnt be too many people who would think this way id hate to be the dude who finds this out when their kid ends up with the same issue
UpliftingNews,removed,so basically anytime a kid or animal is in a vehicle someone could smash the window and rob the vehicle blind abduct the kid or animal and i dont need to go into detail what kidnappers do to children and animals its ohio though so im not surprised total hell hole
UpliftingNews,removed,this pretty much allows me to break windows all day long im going to go troll the parking lots of malls and shopping complexes so i can get my daily fix of public destruction

UpliftingNews,removed,if the family was white the cop was obviously racist fuck the police
UpliftingNews,removed,how about this if you cant afford a kid dont fucking bust inside your girlfriend its not that fucking hard
UpliftingNews,removed,if were talking about starting a childs life in the right place separating them from parents who not only steal but use their children to steal is probably a good start
UpliftingNews,removed,so other people should pay for the kid because their parents are too shitty to nah fuck that and fuck the kid not my kid not my problem

UpliftingNews,removed,not running
UpliftingNews,removed,i suppose some intellectual disabilities might actually give people an advantage in certain physical movements i know retard strength is an offensive thing to say but perhaps someone who lacks self control might might have an advantage to competitive sports because they always go percent

UpliftingNews,removed,the fact that donald trump is a candidate for president shows you can be a hateful prick
UpliftingNews,removed,actually people can do whatever they want shocker
UpliftingNews,removed,sounds like someone is jealous of others getting special treatment and attention you having a bad day or something
UpliftingNews,removed,if you want homosexual cohabitation to be part of the norm why do you need to make it stand out
UpliftingNews,removed,so wait his disability is being smarter than other people
UpliftingNews,removed,confirmed they egged their own house and took down their flag to stage a hate crime
UpliftingNews,removed,always makes you think if this was a set up especially after the lesbian with the tip that was a hateful note that turned out to be written by her for attention or so many other things like that that turned out to be hoaxes for attention
UpliftingNews,removed,or act like they are more important than everybody else and give them special treatment and attention what umm yeah if a dudes house is on fire we tend to focus the water hoses on that house and once the fire is extinguished you commiserate with the dude and maybe bring him some clothes and shit like that jesus what planet are you from
UpliftingNews,removed,wrong i hate fags
UpliftingNews,removed,they should have vandalized all their houses how else will these people learn to not do things i disagree with that doesnt influence me or directly impact my life at all these people deserved to have their private property ruined because they believed in equal rights to everyone instead of us heteros being superior and having more rights
UpliftingNews,removed,just because a rainbow got vandalized doesnt mean it was a hate crime people are so weird
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,they can stand up for themselves ive go shit to do heh ok hopefully when six dudes of a different race from you kick your head in and call you racial slurs no one gives a shit and you stand up for yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,fags ruining every culture whether they know it or not the globalists and tptb are only using you freaks as pawns easily brainwashed and manipulated same shit with the fucking trans fuck it all i hope you all rot in hell
UpliftingNews,removed,out of homes in the area gimme them down votes
UpliftingNews,removed,nice more homes to have your way with
UpliftingNews,removed,geez wont someone think of the vandals now they have to vandalize homes
UpliftingNews,removed,i thought this sub was supposed to be for good news
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont like homosexuals but i would do the same
UpliftingNews,removed,how about they stop flaunting the fact that theyre gay im sure my house would be egged and rightfully so too if i hung banners all over it that say how straight i am sexual preference is just that so how bout we stop being so proud of it
UpliftingNews,removed,then after those homes were vandalized an extra homes hung rainbow flags repeat ad infinitum
UpliftingNews,removed,so now you find the one house that didnt take a flag simple
UpliftingNews,removed,gay
UpliftingNews,removed,the gays probably did it themselves they love the sympathy
UpliftingNews,removed,only dicks because gay
UpliftingNews,removed,thats gay
UpliftingNews,removed,my house got vandalized for hanging a nazi flag and my neighbors did nothin
UpliftingNews,removed,notice there was no proof they were vandalized by anyone other than themselves or if by someone elese for having a rainbow flag nearly all instances like this are done by the people themselves so they can act like victims and get sympathy money attention etc
UpliftingNews,removed,plot twist you know
UpliftingNews,removed,hoax
UpliftingNews,removed,lesbians arent real
UpliftingNews,removed,homes vandalized after coming to the aid of their lgbt friends
UpliftingNews,removed,and houses were vandalized
UpliftingNews,removed,aaahaha this sortof happened in my mother in laws neighborhood they live in a gated community and the only known out gay guy hung a rainbow flag in front of his house of course the old busy bodies on the board complained that he had hung anything but an american flag which is the only type allowed by the hoa hes known on the condo board for being super dramatic about many things one morning he reported that he had been out for a walk at am which was unheard of for him and that someone had come by and destroyed his flag he went to the board and essentially accused everyone he then went and hung rainbow flags on every single persons property without asking them and just waited for anyone to remove it so they could be quietly labeled as homophobic my father in law was the first to remove it he wouldnt mind if his son was gay but he sure as shit wasnt going to let someone make a political statement on his property without at least asking first so thats my story
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont give a fuck about what they do they are a huge reason for the decline of morals around the world our society is spiraling out of control the divide and conquer plan is in full swing and this is just used as another tool to divide
UpliftingNews,removed,watch them all get vandalized
UpliftingNews,removed,genius the house who refuses to out up the banner is the vandalor the vandal being the coward he is has no choice but tonshownthe support
UpliftingNews,removed,licked
UpliftingNews,removed,and then in keeping with the tradition of false flags they all trashed their own flags
UpliftingNews,removed,or you know they could have just decided thats the house they wanted to vandalize everytime something is done to a gay person its because theyre gay and thats why they will never be equal if someone threw eggs and stole an american flag from another house would we call them terrorists
UpliftingNews,removed,why do i have to live at a time when this is news
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont give a crap about gay rights or what they do percent of americans dont really care why is this pushed on us all the time
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah i mean why would you fly a gay flag anyways stop bragging that you suck dicks
UpliftingNews,removed,this must have all been pocs and transgender folk because theres no way the white cis society could be capable of compassion
UpliftingNews,removed,meh muslims wouldve killed them
UpliftingNews,removed,this is the kind of solidarity that i wanted to see form the media after charlie hebdo but instead of after charlie hebdo attack more than media outlets reran the cartoon in solidarity we got after charlie hebdo attack media outlets questions whether charlie hebdo went too far
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont agree with vandilization or any negative acts towards people but a rainbow does not represent gays as a straight person that does not discriminate against anyone but does not support gay rights but thats not possibie you bigot yes it is i proudly display a rainbow just like gangs try to take the color red or the color blue for causes that i dont agree with same thing with the rainbow
UpliftingNews,removed,shifty troll is shitty nice
UpliftingNews,removed,why did the perpetrators vandalize there own home
UpliftingNews,removed,gay as fuc
UpliftingNews,removed,how do they know they were vandalized for hanging a rainbow flag making assumptions about motives can paint a very misleading pictur
UpliftingNews,removed,not to cast doubt on this specific incident but so many of these instances of vandalism or discrimination have been proven false in the last few years i have a hard time believing that they didnt do it themselves to see which of their neighbors would support them and their lifestyle
UpliftingNews,removed,no
UpliftingNews,removed,and yet people demand on passing laws against being an asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,who gives a fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,looks like i have over flags to take down
UpliftingNews,removed,why hang the flag and push it in peoples faces in the first place i dont hang my straight flag out
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this uplifting so a pair of attention seekers vandalized their own home and got the attention they wanted oh wow kumbaya
UpliftingNews,removed,international protests what protests
UpliftingNews,removed,and why did they have the rainbow flag outside these people if you can call them that feed off of attention they are agent provocateurs whos only purpose in their existence is to let people know how theyre gay the way they talk dress and act is not normal just attention seeking self centered perverts
UpliftingNews,removed,sexuality shouldnt be praised and celebrated homosexuality isnt brave fuck this century
UpliftingNews,removed,damn now theres houses to vandalize
UpliftingNews,removed,gayyyyyyeeee
UpliftingNews,removed,everyone in the neighborhood should start carrying scissors and liquor
UpliftingNews,removed,this is the absolute worst post ive ever seen on the front page
UpliftingNews,removed,luckily in my country there is no such a thing like lesbian marriage no one also would be so stupid to parade with gay flag
UpliftingNews,removed,its nice that everyone came together for this couple but as a former child mischief i wonder why they are so quick to jump at the idea that this is a hate crime maybe the kids stole the flag because it was a flag and egged the house because theyre kids and noticed that the car hasnt been in the driveway for a few days and knew they could get away with it if it were the stars and stripes would the neighbours have done the same thing i think theyre being too sensitive towards motivation and guarantee other houses in that neighbourhood have been egged one time or another
UpliftingNews,removed,but were they the mystical pretty attractive lesbians at least one of them pretty please or are they the typical overweight short haired no make up kind
UpliftingNews,removed,just fuck my civilization up fam
UpliftingNews,removed,i think cell phones too im not really a believer in the whole reclaimed word thing if i was black id never call myself a nigger and being gay id definitely never call myself a queer or faggot not to mention the word queer means weird
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,funny sounds pretty jewy to me
UpliftingNews,removed,censorship is never cool
UpliftingNews,removed,this is really the opposite of uplifting in the election votes were cast no wonder no one represents your political votes you dont have any or you want a president that can lick its genitals
UpliftingNews,removed,why so he can hire a necromancer no amount of money is going to raise that bitch from the dead
UpliftingNews,removed,this has to be fake the white woman would have to be fat
UpliftingNews,removed,is it a day trip overnight hell ill donate money so the kids can still go on this trip they are doing a good thing
UpliftingNews,removed,count me in id like to show these kids one good deed deserves another
UpliftingNews,removed,im setting up a gofundme at the moment will update when finished i got all the schools contact info on their district website will update in a few minutes when its set up
UpliftingNews,removed,she fell in love after the first time he pink socked her the british mens penises failed to give her the colon cleansing she truly desired
UpliftingNews,removed,may be connected to something bigger this year
UpliftingNews,removed,connected to hillarys emails i presume
UpliftingNews,removed,well this story really takes some heat off the fbi and their other headlining news stories dont get me wrong great stuff but they are also treading on thin ice and appearing to be trying to influence a presidential election this story feels well timed for the fbi
UpliftingNews,removed,strange timing given their current rather high profile investigations into certain other pedophile rings
UpliftingNews,removed,nice deflection
UpliftingNews,removed,somebody warn hillary she may need to bleach more emails
UpliftingNews,removed,i personally prefer more vanilla erotic fiction but to each their own i guess
UpliftingNews,removed,this is the hillary one
UpliftingNews,removed,any connection to hillary
UpliftingNews,removed,wonder if this is connected to the pedophile running for potus and her gang of corrupt minions
UpliftingNews,removed,probably just hillary friends tho
UpliftingNews,removed,dismantle the fbi for what theyre doing to hillary s
UpliftingNews,removed,so why did you get hit with the children and not uthedumbprogammer im a canadian btw so dont bring the pitchforks i am just really interested
UpliftingNews,removed,from the clinton foundation
UpliftingNews,removed,its days and very important hardly cancer
UpliftingNews,removed,hillary must of let the fbi know where they were keeping bills entertainment in exchange for letting her off
UpliftingNews,removed,isnt hillary clinton also involved in sex trafficking
UpliftingNews,removed,im curious how long it will take them to find out that all of this was masterminded by bill clinton
UpliftingNews,removed,this is bad for hillary theyre getting closer
UpliftingNews,removed,lets hope the clinton foundation child trafficking operation is next
UpliftingNews,removed,hillary is disappointed
UpliftingNews,removed,its clearly an evil conspiracy by comey to work with russia and donald trump and overthrow american democracy the kids are russian actors flown in by wikileaks and paid by the koch brothers to pretend to be sex trafficking victims
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder if this is somehow connected to hillary clintons emails
UpliftingNews,removed,h i l l a r y
UpliftingNews,removed,wow so they were able to figure out where all these children were from from the clinton emails amazing
UpliftingNews,removed,its actually really sad that this many kids were even in sex trafficking at all
UpliftingNews,removed,crazy the clintons are behind it
UpliftingNews,removed,how many were tied to the clintons
UpliftingNews,removed,someone cross reference the list of arrested with the list of those associated with the clintons
UpliftingNews,removed,lockherup
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder if this has anything to do with information found on antony wieners laptop
UpliftingNews,removed,how many clintons were involved
UpliftingNews,removed,any chance this is related to anthony weiner and hillary clintons top aid humas laptop the fbi found i heard arrests were going to be made possibly today
UpliftingNews,removed,did they find where bill was hiding them
UpliftingNews,removed,some of them may be ordered for bill clinton
UpliftingNews,removed,how mad was clinton
UpliftingNews,removed,why are the mods removing any talk of what might have lead to this is this sub infested with agenda pushing censors too
UpliftingNews,removed,they could also start murdering people for no reason
UpliftingNews,removed,this has nothing to do with the purpose of this sub
UpliftingNews,removed,soap box mode activate youre the worst mod of any default sub
UpliftingNews,removed,thats black lives matter for ya
UpliftingNews,removed,relax you jabroni typing in all caps is annoying not attention grabbing
UpliftingNews,removed,ending the drug was starts with you
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah but youre acting like its the fucking cops fault
UpliftingNews,removed,i learned quite a bit about the tolerant left
UpliftingNews,removed,by not dote on the negative you mean not talk about the root issue and thus cause of why the port man was in this scenario if the truth offends you you can stay in your room with the blinds shut and keep off the internet
UpliftingNews,removed,because of that sinister propaganda exists true the us government has made it legal to propagandize us citizens much of what we see on the news is contrived
UpliftingNews,removed,if the victim had been a minority reddit wouldnt be making such a big deal out if this reddit only cares because its a white person i seriously cant stand this white male dominated sure
UpliftingNews,removed,like when the blacks burn down their own church and write trump everywhere devious sinister
UpliftingNews,removed,liberal mental gymnastics when they confront reality that doesnt fit the narrative hey uh maybe those blacks only pretended to cut holes and stick burning cigarettes in the white those damn kkk plotters i wonder if more people have been killed by blm or kkk in last ten years
UpliftingNews,removed,did you just get attacked by four people recently just wondering
UpliftingNews,removed,hes a trump supporter so no
UpliftingNews,removed,hes a trump supporter trying to stir up hate against minorities theres no reason to single this victim out of the hundreds to possibly thousands of hate crimes which followed the election except of course that a trump supporter was the victim in this one case when usually its the other way around even if all the allegations against the perpetrators are true theres no reason give this much coverage for this story let along throw money at it
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck you craka
UpliftingNews,removed,that poster is a trump supporter check the comment history
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet my entire life savings a few million that all four of those savages involved in this innocent mans torture are black lives matter activists
UpliftingNews,removed,the kid who got tortured wasnt even a trump supporter most likely the sick fucks were antitrump and spouting antitrump antiwhite rhetoric but that mostly has nothing to do with the victim if anything they targeting him for being white and disabled
UpliftingNews,removed,im a liberal and a person of color im not black though but i ask where the fuck are black people now and liberal media not calling this for what it is this is a hate crime against a white person with special needs and not in one news article have i seen it pointed out how four blacks committed this torture on a white male had this been the other way round this would have made fkn national news two days ago with race race race written all over it again and again fuck the hypocrisy of liberals it sometimes disgusts me to see both sides being full of conniving assholes hiding the truth to their convenience
UpliftingNews,removed,this is an awful idea
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont want to watch it but you say they were trying to promote is there a link to this mixtape anywhere so they can be publicly shamed
UpliftingNews,removed,blacks are disgusting savages and i dont give a flying shit if i get banned for saying this i fucking hate niggers and this just makes my hate for them stronger disgusting savages who know nothing more than violence
UpliftingNews,removed,tbh i wish they got death over a long timepieces of filth like them dont deserve life
UpliftingNews,removed,and please shoot these animals
UpliftingNews,removed,why the fuck is facebook letting that vid go around but a picture of a goose that looks like its head is on fire gets zucced because they tortured him to make him say antitrump things and they want to intimidate their opposition zuckerberg is an actual terrorist with citizenship in multiple countries
UpliftingNews,removed,beautiful idea for shame on subs like renoughtrumpspam whove taken pleasure from this event hopefully the lad doesnt suffer to much psychological trauma from his experience
UpliftingNews,removed,why wasnt there fundraisers for all the people beat up at trump rallies including the protestor who was beat up for holding a sign and trump and his people and the media ran with the story that it was an assassination attempt which was complete bullshit just like everything else from them another quick money scam by trump supporters they have had scam fundraisers in the past just like their boss
UpliftingNews,removed,ooooh sick burn but seriously if you think were the same species as aboriginals or black people then theres something wrong with you
UpliftingNews,removed,lets be honest this guy deserved it
UpliftingNews,removed,not to be a dock but it does state that the victim went to school with and had a supposed connection to one of the suspects it may be reaching but i have a feeling he went to get weed or something and stuff went south call it hustlers intuition
UpliftingNews,removed,yes its all one big liberal lie to make trump and his supporters out to be bad guys theres no neonazi movement and the only racism is blacks toward rights youre absolutely right you guys should really send these four thank you cards for being the token story to prove your delusions
UpliftingNews,removed,this is a very left leaning site any news even factual news that disrupts their narrative is immediately taken down it is the same in the donald when it is against their narrative in this case the donald is in the right
UpliftingNews,removed,the video of that chicago kid was a hoax too we can all play this game lying troll
UpliftingNews,removed,you probably think brietbart is the best possible source there is right
UpliftingNews,removed,where is dexter when you need him
UpliftingNews,removed,lol
UpliftingNews,removed,im streaming for now dont know how this will be received but people can come watch me play games and be entertained war thunder and i have a donation page i just set up and all proceeds are going to the victim for sure and i will make sure of that i literally am disgusted and utterly appalled at what happened to him i want him and his family to have the most help they can get as a fellow trump supporter he needs my help
UpliftingNews,removed,kidnapped dec parents went to cops dropped year old son off at mcdonalds went missing reported to cops blacks cops ignored parents dec livestreaming on facebook begins within closed group of gangmembers live stream continue to jan full days of livestream torture authoritys do nothing gang feeling confident start streaming to youtubecom and open channel for facebook to public cops still do nothing jan gang takes the victim for a walk in the snow wearing only his boxers on a leash cops investigate cops go to the house where he was held for filming jan story goes viral why did this take days had the gang not taken this victim outside for a pottywalk in the snow this man would have died httpchicagosuntimescomnewsblackcaptorstorturewhitevictimrantagainsttrumpcpdsays
UpliftingNews,removed,i am really bothered by this trend of crowdfunding in lieu of doing something that has actual benefit for the world horrible things happen to millions of people on a daily basis the admittedly horrible experience this young man went through wasnt even the worst thing that happened to a human being on this day or even in the past hour money isnt going to help this person forget what happened to them at best its going to give a few people a rather pathetic excuse to feel good about themselves by doing the least amount possible just stop already if you want to do something good in the world go out and actually do something good in the world be an agent of change feed a hungry person visit someone in hospice who has no one there for them clothe a homeless person intervene the next time you see someone in real need dont just stand passively by and wish you had done more after the fact community isnt about giving money anonymously over the internet its about empathy and oneonone human interaction in the real world that exists outside of your comfort zone im not saying that giving money is wrong and if thats really all someone can bring themselves to do then its probably better than doing nothing at all but come on giving money is easy if we really want to live in a better world then we have to do the hard things not the easy ones
UpliftingNews,removed,how the fuck does don lemon say this isnt a hate crime i believe its just bad house training time to take them to the streets and beat them like a dog
UpliftingNews,removed,daily reminder this act was explicitly done for political and racial reasons but the mainstream media refuses to acknowledge that because it doesnt fit their agenda
UpliftingNews,removed,there is so many incidents and you say its all a hoax you are a liar and a pathetic troll just like the rest justice will be served to you fucks eventually
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah because that has never happened
UpliftingNews,removed,lol wat when a black person is attacked by a white one you get the top of every big subreddit attacking trump because he somehow did you get all the mainstream media covering it calling all whites racist but now big subreddits censoring it mainstream media refusing to report that they were screaming fuck white people and fuck trump and somehow saying that isnt a hate crime and theyre just stupid kids that dindu nothing and were spreading the word of jesus how biased can you be how cant you see whats happening this happened two days ago and were only seeing it today because of the altright put pressure on the media if that didnt happen you wouldnt ever see this also statistics are fun according to the fbi black people kill more black people than anyone else does but wait thats not all black people also more white people than white people kill black people now you might think oh but its not a big well you need to account for the fact that there is times more white people than black people and yet blacks commit the majority of the violent crime really makes you think doesnt it its like your dindu narrative is starting to unravel
UpliftingNews,removed,minute uncensored
UpliftingNews,removed,im not sure about that do you walk around telling lies to people and jeopardizing peoples careers so you can go to a rock concert are you a failed paramedic working a dead end security gig at a backwater college in coastal british columbia do you lie about completing patrols and sit in your office all day are you a bitch shannon are you okay maybe just a tiny bit bitter i still came out way way ahead so just let me have this celebration of my past victories okay
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry whats the double standard here
UpliftingNews,removed,it has been banned in all other subreddits that it was posted that has any sizeable amount of foottraffic and where is your proof of that for fucks sake you co sliracy cunts are the worst
UpliftingNews,removed,so are you pro kid killing or pro retard torturing
UpliftingNews,removed,white trump supporter with special needs attacked by black guys this is the perfect opportunity for all the dae black people are the problem douchebags to try and claim the moral high ground obviously itd still be outrageous regardless of the races involved i just think its veen jumped on by the tedious antipc crowd
UpliftingNews,removed,what would that shit on exactly you think people on the left wabted a disabled kidto get tortured and him getting money would be somehow the worst
UpliftingNews,removed,if its free youre the product hurr durr
UpliftingNews,removed,a thread about a boy who got attacked for supporting trump and a comment thread about trump supporting the boy financially pretty sure theres not a more appropriate place for that discussion
UpliftingNews,removed,everyone did because that never happened
UpliftingNews,removed,because youre a moron
UpliftingNews,removed,no i mean i want any proof or evidence that even suggests its been blocked on even a few major subs my own research doesnt show that at all so lets see what youve got
UpliftingNews,removed,donalds sub raised money for the church burning turned out it was one of its parishioners and they happened to be black glad the caught the real person cause the media sure played up the whole trump supporters are violent angle just another hoax btw increase anyone didnt watch the vid i dont blame you this crime was even more serious it was another real hate crime the media is trying to bury he was made to drink toilet water used as an ashtray beaten and partially scalped the attackers were saying fk white people and fk trump this real hate crime is maybe even more heinous than the other one from months ago also from chicago where a man was brutally assaulted by a gaggle of thugs and they stole his car as they drove off he tried to hang onto his only car but was ultimately thrown off at about an hr which sent him rolling and bouncing off the pavement for about msm like cnn edited out the f trump supporters and f white people bit nothing new and the police chief of chicago merely says its just kids doing stupid kids stuff these boy was brutally attacked by adults and kidnapped for lets send him some love and show him not everyone is savages
UpliftingNews,removed,blacks hate white oppression so they do this not the best political strategy ive heard of
UpliftingNews,removed,but hes a trump supporter therefore hes a racist misogynist homophobic bigot or at least thats what cnn tells me
UpliftingNews,removed,wlm
UpliftingNews,removed,facebook sounds like chicago pd
UpliftingNews,removed,id imagine it will help with his hospital bill i doubt they hospital gives enough of a fuck to not charge them
UpliftingNews,removed,what is it with you gullible idiots and sending money to strangers fuck op and his dumb fundraiser and fuck the morons that are always trying to crowdfund sums that end up god knows where
UpliftingNews,removed,young white special needs victim tied up and getting tortured by others who happened to be black and shouting fuck white people fuck trump
UpliftingNews,removed,getting tortured by others easy with the hard r its pronounced othas
UpliftingNews,removed,no it wouldnt it would show that the president is willing to make a token gesture to score some political points and add to the us vs them mentality of his supporters it would also add to the idea that he only gives a shit about discrimination when its against a white trunp supporter
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck trump but fuck the people that did this more
UpliftingNews,removed,now if we could only do something for the thousands of other chicagoans that desperately need it man fuck that city
UpliftingNews,removed,that is one psychotic looking bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,just because the subhumans who attacked him said hes a trump supporter it doesnt make it so
UpliftingNews,removed,what is the double standard there exactly
UpliftingNews,removed,how about no ill wait until the facts come out first for all i know the victim had it coming this story is way too vague for me
UpliftingNews,removed,show the perpetrators some rope
UpliftingNews,removed,i am looking at it objectively objectively a special needs student getting tortured is a less common and more shocking incident than racially motivated attacks so many sites lead with that fact sorry but youre being ridiculous
UpliftingNews,removed,his own party took his twitter away from him right before election day because they didnt trust him to not type ignorance based on the fact that you believed that garbage hit piece from the failing new york times and the rest of your post you seem drunk on fake news stop it
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck your faggoty gofundme bullshit lets avenge these actions by systematically eliminating the problem niggers
UpliftingNews,removed,how white people react to a serious hate crime in the century lets sit in our houses throwing money at the victim until we all feel better pathetic do this but do not forget top go and scream
UpliftingNews,removed,theres no way this is really the picture you idiots used
UpliftingNews,removed,yes one site i dont care how massive you think the site is not as popular as you think one sites headlines does not make a trend for all of liberal media you claumed that the media was doing something your evidence was one site doing it thats not fucking good enough and yes him being mentally challegenged is the unique part racially motivated attacks happen all the time in the us disavled people getting tortured doesnt
UpliftingNews,removed,what role does the victim being mentally challenged have in the entire story it has a role in making people click the article its attention grabbing and shocking please learn how the fuck news works these days
UpliftingNews,removed,dude the guy that did that was a black member of the church a hoax
UpliftingNews,removed,the point he is making is that had this been four white people abusing a mentally handicapped black man then not only would this be labelled a hate crime something the media are avoiding in this case but there would be upheaval and mass protests on large scales about how the system is against a person of colour here we have the complete opposite a white handicapped male being the victim and now because he is not relatable to the folk that usually make such a big deal they simply dont care to me this confirms exactly who the real racists are poor kid hope he recovers and is not traumatised for life
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck you for saying supposed theres a video he was kidnapped and tortured for over hours hes a fucking victim you lefty cunt even if he is a white devil and carries the burden of responsibility for all evil since the beginning of time according to you eat shit and die
UpliftingNews,removed,i have checked mainstream sources youre talking comolete horseshit not having the story on their front page doesnt mean shit have you perhaps considered that there is other news and that this story is not the most important thing to happen in the world for fucks sake check outside of your extremely limited american bubble
UpliftingNews,removed,most trunp supporters are either cunts or totally okay with trump being a cunt or just plain ignorant difference is supporting trump is a choice with actual meaningful effects on things being black isnt
UpliftingNews,removed,again why is he not allowed to emphasize a word are you the fucking grammar gestapo seriously grow the fuck up you whiney man child
UpliftingNews,removed,can we create a petition to demand the death penalty for the four individuals i dont know too much about how all of that works anyone with some legal experience have any suggestions does anyone else agree they deserve more than just prison sentences please let me not be the only one who still believes in true justice
UpliftingNews,removed,i rather put out on the street for the heads of these evil persons
UpliftingNews,removed,see if this gets up votes or down votes itll be telling white man targeted by blacks for the sole reason of him being white while they attacked him they said f white people f trump
UpliftingNews,removed,tell that to all the black folk killing blacks
UpliftingNews,removed,hate crimes are far higher than coincidental mentally challenged victims being victims of torture you mean far more common which is exactly why him having special needs is more shocking because its less common also if you think headlines are designed to give all the relevant infornation in an article and not to entice people in with the pronise of more information then you frankly dont have a clue what youre talking about headlines are designed to draw people in giving out information is secondary
UpliftingNews,removed,who here thinks american media is partially responsible due to the false narrative created in attempts to convince people not to vote for him i personally experienced some of this racial profiling at a rally where gangs of people were shouting racist fuck white people and fuck donald trump this false propaganda has consequences and this time it was a special needs individual who paid the price fuck our news fuck our tv fuck our political propaganda bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah i love the way those niggers noaxed that big fucking gash in his head
UpliftingNews,removed,this is that white privilege right
UpliftingNews,removed,white cop shoots black armed robber nooo stoppp black lives matter he was innocent black guys beat up a white disabled trump supporter this is insignificant why dont we worry about the other black on black crime
UpliftingNews,removed,black lives matter is a terrorist organization if this was a white on black crime a major city would be on fire right now why did cnn cut out the fuck white people part
UpliftingNews,removed,are we just completely ignoring the fuck white people fuck trump comments in the video or what
UpliftingNews,removed,it looks like thinly veiled white supremacy to me this is the type of crime that would have triggered waves of lynchings decades ago now were not lynching in the physical sense of the word but still in the mob mentality sense it sounds like the parent comment is blaming the entire black demographic for not stopping four individuals

UpliftingNews,removed,i feel bad you dont know how to use a oxford comma because i couldnt understand the sentence when you first wrote it you couldnt read that very simple sentence and yet youre accusing me of having a cognitive disability because i assumed something how does making an assumption give me a disability exactly its kind of funny that you think the oxford comma is some sign of great intelligence and that not using it means im somehow mentally challenged could care less well yes you could clearly its not a case of you not caring as you made a point of mentioning that him being a trump supporter meant you had to support him percent pull your head out of your arse and stop trying to be condescending for fucks sake youre absolutely crap at it
UpliftingNews,removed,as if youre not all over this thread trying to politicize this go fuck yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,but hes a trump supporter isnt that like supporting a racist white nationalist
UpliftingNews,removed,no you have to know the root reason and cause just because it makes you uncomfortable doesnt mean crap
UpliftingNews,removed,i think we should take all four of the assailants tie them to chairs and carve little pieces of their flesh off to feed them piece by piece this seems like an appropriate punishment for these pieces of filth more painful than a bullet and my tax dollars arent being wasted on feeding them in prison
UpliftingNews,removed,this comment is pretty revealing maybe one day youll realise not everyone is as insulated and ignorant of world events as you are what part of any of this story requires me to be american to understand or comment
UpliftingNews,removed,are we going to buy him blm tshirts
UpliftingNews,removed,let me guess fascist scum at it again
UpliftingNews,removed,oh really there are on subreddits other than the cesspool known as td the majority of the comments in this thread are talking about how the victim was mentally handicapped the fact that they are a white trump supporter being attacked specifically because they are a white trump supporter is completely absent so your assertion that were only focusing on helping in this thread is total bs

UpliftingNews,removed,urazorsheldon s lack of mention actually makes my blood boil hes the reason this is spiraled more because there are no repercussions like there have been for far less crimes of whites against blacks racism needs to end for both sides urazorsheldon

UpliftingNews,removed,thanks renoughtrumpspam
UpliftingNews,removed,ironic isnt it as a white guy for years you could be pissed every time a hate crime happened but youd still get ire and blame for it you could go out of your way to make things right and youd still get shit on and told you were privileged you could do every possible thing you could think of and it wouldnt be enough doesnt feel good does it
UpliftingNews,removed,which one does reddit deem the victim here surely not the white people

UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,if youre white just get the fuck out of chicago and take your money and business with you and let the city fucking rot with all the animals like this inside
UpliftingNews,removed,take a wild guess at the demographic that would do this
UpliftingNews,removed,this is why the police is militarized this is why so many black people are shot by cops its not accidents its not racism its these people are barely fucking human
UpliftingNews,removed,you are wasting my time take a hike and no i dont give a fuck if you are upset fuck trump bye
UpliftingNews,removed,this story is sensationalist as fuck lets wait until the full details come out before we start raising money shall we i think some of you might be disapointed to find out that the kid did something incredibly stupid in the lead up to this and no that doesnt make it ok these people are still animals just like the taliban are animals but i still dont feel much sympathy for that backpacking couple who got kidnapped because theyre idiots and before i get a bunch of shit because hes mentally challenged though lets just consider the fact that his parents dropped him off at mcdonalds alone on new years and then didnt file a missing persons report until monday either theyre bad parents or he wasnt that retarded this reminds me ironically enough of the mike brown shooting everyone gets all worked up before we really know what happens then when we find out that all the evidence corroborates the cops side of things everyones all embarrassed and doesnt want to talk about it anymore
UpliftingNews,removed,wow did you visit the ocean recently youre hella salty dont forget to being a towel
UpliftingNews,removed,what about the raping and the insertion of the coat hangers of the disabled black teen by the football teen then one of the players not getting jail time
UpliftingNews,removed,its called mccarthyism trump has nothing to do with the kkk never did its slanderous to malign trump with kkk and quite frankly pretty sad he has sacrificed so much to help this country out hes giving up a golden palace to downgrade to the whitehouse hes refusing his president salary he spent of his own money and from the people and small donations hes beholden to no one and anyone saying otherwise is full of chit buddy the kkk is standard fear mongering tactics of the democrats ironic since they started the kkk but the democrats need a turn out from the black community or they lose every years they drag the kkk out of the barn and dust it off news outlets report all these hoax hate crimes it was brutal this year you cant blame trump you cant he has never said anything about black people he has brought up radical islam and illegal aliens islam is an ideology a horribly oppressive one at that thats waging war on the west not just here but abroad as well this is why theres a surge of populism across europe and here in america mexican is a nationality like american and for some reason being american or having american pride has been conflated with hate speech everyone is allowed to have a culture by western european countries and america i guess did you happen to see the leaked george soro email where he called the death of freddy grey a unique opportunity this really paved the way for the blm movement that has led to such racial division they were around before trump was did you see the email of soros from expressing the need for a progressive echo chamber this is important because soros was a major funder of obamas and hillarys second biggest contributer next to the saudis he destablizes nations for a living in his own words hes there to make money and doesnt care about the social ramifications of what he does hes also a nazi collaborator a judenrat a jewish person under nazi rule who turned in his fellow jewish people he would do this and sell their belongings only at the time but refers to it as the happiest time of his life you point the finger at trump or his supporters but im asking you to take a long hard look the partys never switched sides repsdems ill prove it to you i know the leftist and democratic folklore of the southern strategy and goldwater but lets take a step back the republicans were founded just to bring an end to slavery ok thats not disputed right after the civil war the republicans lost the next battles gun control and marriage licenses gun control to keep guns out of the hands of newly freed slaves and marriage licencesto keep blacks from marrying whites prior to that marriage was purely a religious practice between the couple and their church their commitment to god in maragret sanger founded planned parenthood this is like the modern lefts church today hillary clinton calls maragret sanger her idol and role model its fitting because like hillary maragret was also a democrat and like hillary maragret had a public and private position sanger believed in abortion whole heartedly she thought that for the betterment of society the babies of the feeble minded and lower class should be aborted or plucked like weeds she like to refer to it as that was her public position but in private she just said retarded and minorities of abortion clinics are located in minority communities today its estimated that million black babies alone have been aborted ever since out of all the horrors the democrats have unleashed onto this country like jim crow separate but equal no blacks allowed kkk lynchings firehoses and dogs planned parenthood is the worst atrocity ever perpetrated on the black community democrats great society project redlined around the black communities and deemed them unfit for investment democrat lbjs new deal kept blacks dependent on welfare for less than minimum wage buying their votes which upon signing as witnessed by senators as saying well keep these niers voting democrat for the next years these areas are now known as ghettos and have been democratically ran ever since for some even years to quote a democratic delegate by the name of clemont vallandingham out of ohio the civil war was a cruel and unnecessary war you see democrats truly believed a freed slave wouldnt be able to feed themselves cloth themselves or put a roof over their head a kind of racism that still exist today we republicans reject this kind of thinking this is the same racist patronizing thing democrats do with voting id laws claiming that black people cant afford or get ids that it suppresses black voters you know because apparently to democrats they just arent capable of handling such things surely they cant handle buying cigarettes or liquor or drive a car for that matter either i guess because those things require id bill clintons strikes laws locked up a generation of fathers while hillary clinton calls young blacks superpredators and has been recorded saying they need to be brought to heel now whos the party that has abortions for sportlena dunham anyone whos the party for gun control whos the party telling you what size of fountain drink you can have whos the party trying to control how people speak whos the party still trying to dictate marriages and if you dont follow their marriage laws theyll send an angry mob to your bakery with torches and pitchforks instead of hoods they were hoops in their ears and have blue hair and thick black glasses so you know they must be smart and whos the freedom loving pro life loving gun toting patriotic af party that just wants the government the hell out of peoples lives and to leave people the hell alone

UpliftingNews,removed,life sounds like you need to get one
UpliftingNews,removed,i thought by the title the white people were going to riot like they should
UpliftingNews,removed,oh i dont know a university professor calling for the genocide of white people hundreds of thousands of tweets and articles after the elction saying fuck white men fuck white people and kill all white men how about killallwhiten being supported by prominent feminists all over the west how about classes called the problem of whiteness how about leftists defending all of these things yeah go fuck yourself leftist trash
UpliftingNews,removed,so out of all the sad stories that get shared on uplifting news why does this one warrent a modsupported fundraiser call me cynical but a white guy gets attacked by black people and reddit is raising money this didnt happen for any of the black kids killed by white cops just sayin
UpliftingNews,removed,waitso why didnt we do this for all the other victims of hate crimes the mentally disabled black boy who was beaten and sexually assaulted by the group of white kids nothing the black boy who was attacked and almost drowned by the group of whites my god i hate to be that guy but seriouslyamerica is acting like this is now a brand new national tragedy
UpliftingNews,removed,if this were a black person there would be rioting in the streets since they are white we need to request a day off of work first
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre black their entire culture is based around rap and how much of a criminal you are
UpliftingNews,removed,feels black african american mirroresque ftfy d
UpliftingNews,removed,there needs to be a petition to have the perpetrators put in jail this was a hate crime against a white man wheres the backlash
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure you have a totally reasonable and not racist explanation for that phenomena are facts racist black people just commit more anti white violent hate crimes than whites do of interracial violence is black on white why is every statement out of you some faggy snark with no numbers or logic to back any of it up this isnt the daily show there is no laugh track youre not funny and im not as stupid as most daily show viewers are you faggot
UpliftingNews,removed,this is a rip off none of your money is going to the victim scam alert
UpliftingNews,removed,kys
UpliftingNews,removed,again youre fallaciously calling any and all interracial crime hate crime i didnt actually i was just citing that as a supporting argument its infinitely more than youve done which so far is just misinterpret my argument and ignore facts
UpliftingNews,removed,why the fuck is this under uplifting news
UpliftingNews,removed,so still no video huh faggot
UpliftingNews,removed,just be sure youre less supportive than you were to the black people who were killed because of their race well unless you think beating and public humiliation is worse than murder for some reason
UpliftingNews,removed,she looks absolutely beautiful really
UpliftingNews,removed,seriously give it up its dead republicans right now arent allowing a vote on very small gun control measures they are straight up obstructing because they dont want it to go on record that they voted against minuscule gun control measures after children were killed and young adults were killed by an assault rifle a bunch of cowards they have no convictions
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,honest question though do you think its possible these politicians could be respectful and tolerant of gay people while at the same time believing it shouldnt be the governments place to determine who a business decides to cater to i dont have a strong opinion on the matter but when i see a big deal being made out of that cake shop controversy i really dont see it as this huge issue at the end of the day maybe im wrong though idk
UpliftingNews,removed,gay
UpliftingNews,removed,i hate homos they hate guns
UpliftingNews,removed,men should be men means that men should be strong courageous and dependable theres nothing wrong with believing this weakness cowardliness and untrustworthiness arent good qualities
UpliftingNews,removed,ah yes lets all be uplifted by white guilt groveling when it is islamists who are overwhelmingly murdering gays nice propaganda
UpliftingNews,removed,lol what a bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,banassaultdogs
UpliftingNews,removed,did you know swans could be gay
UpliftingNews,removed,what does everybody on this faggy site cry so much
UpliftingNews,removed,apparently he wasnt the only one
UpliftingNews,removed,look at the still of the vid without playing it kid has a gigantic boner
UpliftingNews,removed,wont women be less desirable in an office environment if you have to pay them while theyre pregnant how is the business compensated
UpliftingNews,removed,okay i kind of disagree that a man should be at home when its more natural for a woman to take care of a child durring those stages of life breast feeding is something a child needs for proper immune system development but i supposed you could just pump milk throughout the day and collect it and either way i dont think a company should have to pay for someone to leave work because they decide to have a child male or female its a strain on the company as whole monetarily and workload wise in the period which anyone might need to leave they would need to replace you not pay you
UpliftingNews,removed,at my office mother get weeks paid and fathers now get changed in from none for fathers the funny thing is that there are quite a few liberal feminist types in the office and they dont see an issue with different treatment for women vs men there
UpliftingNews,removed,being prepared to finance time off of work is part of being prepared to have a child your employer is not responsible for your reproductive decisions and as such they shouldnt have to pay you for your time off when you have a child its that simple
UpliftingNews,removed,we as a species unite neckbeard
UpliftingNews,removed,all workers should be allowed the same benefits if i chose not to have a child i dont get a guaranteed period of paid leave yet when my coworker decides to have a child i have to work to make up for their time away having a child is a choice choices typically have consequences what are maternity and paternity laws protecting who is left to carry the burden as a sperm donor would i get guaranteed time off for every child if im prolific enough could i charge doubletime or make a living having done nothing more than land a very nice job for all of a day before taking indefinite paid leave thatd be swell or we can guarantee everyone can take up to weeks once every years for whatever reason this has nothing to do with being male or female its irrespective of choosing to have children or not its not a law which attempts to enforce particular social values or norms and doesnt tacitly discriminate against say homosexuals who are far less likely to have children
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile who has no kids in part due to a desire to save the fucking planet gets to do all their work as well as my own but gotta have more people seven billion isnt enough
UpliftingNews,removed,what do fathers get in return for taking care of a newborn child nothing sexist discriminationwomen get paid to not work while the man is still expected to have to do everything without paid time off women should get as much leave as a man does i thought we are all for equality not giving women more and men nothing
UpliftingNews,removed,so if i am unable to have children or choose not to have children do i get to take the same amount of time off to write a novel or go to the beach or would i just be discriminated against not attacking just genuinely curious
UpliftingNews,removed,now im just waiting for my paid nochildrenbychoice leave to become more common
UpliftingNews,removed,it think you are all insane to expect to be paid to have a child
UpliftingNews,removed,cunt
UpliftingNews,removed,lets see you decide to have a child now a company has to pay you to stay home and be a parent why not pay you until they start school at the very leastwhy stop at two weekshow did generations before this ever get by is beyond meand for men if we can still call them that who take advantage of this should be ashamed of them self for taking a free ride at the expanse of your employerbonding time you have your entire life time to bond with your child
UpliftingNews,removed,time to get a job and knock my wife up
UpliftingNews,removed,men are supposed to work while women care for children this is a bad idea
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont understand this if your employer didnt get you pregnant why should your employer have to pay you for the time that you are unable to work and if you didnt plan ahead enough that you didnt have vacation time enough or savings enough to cover the missed time then why should anyone feel sorry for you and yes i understand that rape is a thing and i think those kinds of expenses should come from medical insurance not the employer
UpliftingNews,removed,ahh the rewards of cumming inside
UpliftingNews,removed,but it is for lack of better wording a choice of hobby or pastime we are not having a people shortage in this day and age if anything we need to reward controlled breeding rather than unbridled reproduction if one cant afford to do it on ones own time i dont see that it needs to be financially supplemented by anyone any more than a passion for race car driving needs to be supplemented i dont work so none of this affects me directly but i dont ask people for freebies in life besides were i a reproductively challenged person who was also unable to qualify to adopt i would certainly be talking to my lawyer about a discrimination suit
UpliftingNews,removed,its a choice if it doesnt sound fun dont do it
UpliftingNews,removed,if its such a punishment why did she choose to do it to herself
UpliftingNews,removed,no im sure its awful but im sure writing a novel is hellish as well i dont plan on attempting either
UpliftingNews,removed,why should he yes you absolutely should get time off but if youre not making the company any money why should you get paid i can buy into the state giving you some sort of allowance similar to unemployment while your boss gives you unpaid leave four states already do this
UpliftingNews,removed,how is paid leave not discriminatory to people who choose not to have children how about giving everyone a set number of vacationpersonaletc days and letting everyone use them accordingly if you choose to have a child you should plan your days how the fuck is it fair to everyone else
UpliftingNews,removed,there shouldnt be paid parental leave at all having children is a choice and one that the rest of us shouldnt have to subsidize
UpliftingNews,removed,the world is overpopulated as is why should anyone pay you not to work how is it fair to your responsible coworkers if you want a kid raise it on your time save you vacationpersonal days and use it the rest of us dont owe you anything
UpliftingNews,removed,its nuts to think that a company or the government should pay you for a year to bond with your child if you want to have a child that is your business your business you getting knocked up should not be subsidized by the government of a company its just nuts
UpliftingNews,removed,unpaid parental leave sure
UpliftingNews,removed,canadian here ppl get a whole year off paid cant imagine how a person income household could do it without someone home to look after baby
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah no not sure what branch youre in but the air force doesnt do this almost at all and if the air force doesnt do it id be amazed that any other branch does the only times that ive seen people get flown back home was when some guys wife got raped and when some guys wife was most likely going to die in child birth
UpliftingNews,removed,that sounds awfully devaluing to women
UpliftingNews,removed,up to weeks unpaid but who can afford that if you cant afford why are you having a child in the first place why should the company and your coworkers suffer because you want to contribute to overpopulation
UpliftingNews,removed,the fact that you called it the chair force is pretty much the reason that i made the comment its viewed as such a weak branch that if they dont allow people to leave why would any other branch
UpliftingNews,removed,i really just feel that he got incredibly lucky
UpliftingNews,removed,thats rich coming someone who is complaining about not having paid leave you should tell all the morons here complaining about it that life isnt fair i love idiots on reddit who complain about climate change and the environmental problems but want to support cockroaches who choose to breed like cockroaches
UpliftingNews,removed,then why the fuck are you complaining in the first place i love how selfish people have no selfawareness thats right champ life isnt fair quit your whining nobody should be force to pay you to squeeze out a cockroach and add to the worlds overpopulation problem
UpliftingNews,removed,so you want women to take time off and then let all of their female friends take time off too to help them out i stand corrected its not only devaluing to women but also to men
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont know been deployed quite a few times and have been deployed with a lot of guys with pregnant wives and every single one minus the almost death of them has ridden out the deployment granted air force deployments are typically only months so it makes more sense to keep us there the whole time versus the other branchs month deployments
UpliftingNews,removed,ok if you accidentally get pregnant a company shouldnt be forced to pay you for time off period get it period you dont get them when youre pregnant haha
UpliftingNews,removed,ah resorting to ad hominems because the truth hurts keep trying nutjob
UpliftingNews,removed,when youre would you like to have competent doctors nurses police officers what about garbage men when im i wouldnt give a shit tbh in order for those people to exist people have to give birth now and in the future you must be a genius but considering youre on the internet and must rely on the children of millions of people to exist and have a good life dont you understand why societies should take care of children and those who have just undergone a recent medical procedure to have them actually since civilization was created without any paternalmaternal leave using your logic we should ban it all are you saying that we wont have any internet or garbage men or nurses if we didnt have maternalpaternal leave thats funny my parents didnt have paternalmaternal leave my grandparents didnt either
UpliftingNews,removed,earth is overpopulated but if you live in a comfortable first world country then its okay for people to have kids actually it isnt because if you live in a comfortable first world country you are using the resources that a third world person does so it is even more incumbent on you to not have any children if you care about the environmentetc maybe if they are good parents there will be a higher chance of those kids becoming minds that could save the planet in the future save the planet the planet doesnt need saving if all the people died off the planet will be fine what a delusional leech you are
UpliftingNews,removed,in our current trend it will need a humans to save it are you dense the planet doesnt need humans humans need the planet if an asteroid struck earth and all the people were killed the planet will be fine
UpliftingNews,removed,so if you get in a car accident your employer shouldnt pay for your days off of course not after sick dayspersonal daysvacation days why should the company pay you for your time off you made the choice to drive a car and choices have consequences exactly or consider the fact that the vast majority of diseases in the us are caused by lifestyle choices why should you get health insurance to assist with your lung cancer because you pay for it im against universal healthcare if you want healthcare you pay for it do you also believe that people shouldnt pay for schools if they dont have children yes i actually believe this you pay for what you use or roads if they dont drive you dont pay for roads if you dont drive gas tax pays for road amazing isnt it you pay for what you use its crazy i know also you are an exceedingly unpleasant individual no you are you are a parasite
UpliftingNews,removed,clearly this man functions on some new plane of consciousness we mere mortals couldnt grasp no its a rather simple concept its just selfish people want something for nothing leeches like you want others to pay for your wife shitting out some cockroach how about you pay for your own filth lets be fair stop reaching into other peoples pockets for your trash okay
UpliftingNews,removed,how about for those of use that will never have kids we should have the same amount of paid time off or some other form of compensation i think vacation sick time off for kids should be large chunk of paid time off that you can use as you see fit we should have true equality for women and men regardless of their choice to have kids or not
UpliftingNews,removed,my apologies i didnt realize you were a donald trump supporter before i initially responded im not im an antihilary supporter i like anyone who is not hilary cliinton ps httptaxfoundationorgarticlegasolinetaxesandtollspayonlythirdstatelocalroadspending you cant be this fucking stupid yes other userbase taxes fill in the gaps meaning people who use it its always the morons who want to hide from the truth who provides links only and never references anything in the link please show me one tax in your link that are of people who dont use the roads make me laugh
UpliftingNews,removed,are you saying that because one day i might grow old where ill need to rely on my children for living assistance and they might drop me off by a lake if so thats pretty cruel of you to say
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,its about time those chubby homeless guys got up out of the creek and started seeking drier shelters
UpliftingNews,removed,homeless remove pounds of trash from san jose creek its cluttered with years of castoffs from homeless residents and illegal dumpers which theyre at least partially responsible for in the first place plus they live there its not an entirely altruistic move
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile in portland homeless create pounds of trash along a biking trail
UpliftingNews,removed,youre a country with empty houses for every homeless person homeless people picking up the trash you throw around to recycle it for a few cents so they might be able to afford some food is not uplifting in any way whatsoever this sub really is a place to feel good about yourselves and condone pull your bootstraps up mentality ive seen kids selling lemonade to contribute towards their families healthcare upvoted to thats uplifting and people being uplifted reading about teenagers working double jobs and cycling miles and miles to them just to afford the necessities of life what the actual fuck is wrong with you people
UpliftingNews,removed,no because this guy wants them to be mad like he is
UpliftingNews,removed,im fairly sure robots could do environmental cleanup pretty much anything involving manual labor will be automated eventually
UpliftingNews,removed,coyote creek homeless stream stewarts somanytypos
UpliftingNews,removed,also this subreddit is meant to be mad like he is
UpliftingNews,removed,why did the homeless remove your mom from the creek
UpliftingNews,removed,alternate title homeless start picking up after themselves
UpliftingNews,removed,i live in the city where san jose would send us their homeless people on a free bus because we would be nicer to them and provide them everything they would need now most of them live on my university campus take up all the computers at the library and sleep in our hour cafes san jose is literally shit
UpliftingNews,removed,by leaving
UpliftingNews,removed,the lesson enslave the homeless
UpliftingNews,removed,ok chief
UpliftingNews,removed,getting homeless people to pick up trash so they go into a draw to win is some serious rlatestagecapitalism
UpliftingNews,removed,homes dont work though most people that are mentally ill arent going to maintain a home properly or will leave it all together in denver we have a sizeable homeless population but still have empty shelters giving people basic housing isnt a silvrr bullet
UpliftingNews,removed,fat homeless lady does not compute
UpliftingNews,removed,they moved
UpliftingNews,removed,ops mom finally got out of the water
UpliftingNews,removed,it feeds into this individualism it certainly does were supposed to be a society society failed these people and theyre barely scraping by some basically dying anyways if you get uplifted from these types of stories you just want to look out for you thats not uplifting thats sad they live in a sad fucking state and people are getting happy jesus christ thats horrible this is about as uplifting as knowing hitler didnt kill your whole family you still have your uncle that touches you alive because you worked at a death camp very well
UpliftingNews,removed,they werent even paid they were given lottery tickets for a chance at gift cards fuck sakes how is this exploitation in any way uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,homeless remove pounds of trash from the same creek they are responsible for destroying cmon thats not really uplifting is it
UpliftingNews,removed,its simple gestures like these that keep the plebs docile how sweet
UpliftingNews,removed,someone needs to replace fox news with this sub

UpliftingNews,removed,why couldnt it be that the black dude was helping the womans son go to to the olympics
UpliftingNews,removed,wtf dont you think the government should pay for the athletes immediate family to at least go and see the olympics
UpliftingNews,removed,while i love this whole story when i saw the tweet that says someone donated to my gofundme god is so good i gotta admit that person gotta be peeved that person is legit as fuck give them the credit
UpliftingNews,removed,is this not an uplifting story to you if not i would suggest that your sensibilities are quite different than the majority of people
UpliftingNews,removed,i thought the guy was from the us given his name it wasnt random just pointing out that the government in australia does more to protect sharks than most other governments
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting this belongs in rlatestagecapitalism
UpliftingNews,removed,if it works the way most commercial fisheries do it wont accomplish a damned thing in most of this sort of fishery there is a fleet wide quota set in tons one less boat means nothing the fleet will still take its quotasorry to rain n the parade
UpliftingNews,removed,do i come to your place of work and leave poo nuggets in your hersheys kisses wrappers

UpliftingNews,removed,how are you being upvoted you clearly didnt read the article wait of course no one else did either
UpliftingNews,removed,dont mean to be a dick but wouldnt it be easier to read the article before posting a comment
UpliftingNews,removed,look im all for saving sharks but wouldnt that money be better spent on saving humans
UpliftingNews,removed,i thought all cops were racist though
UpliftingNews,removed,why does he bike hours if he doesnt have a home where is he biking from
UpliftingNews,removed,this isnt really uplifting its incredible that he does this and its a huge inspiration but the fact is that he has to do this in the first place
UpliftingNews,removed,wow way to see the negative in this situation you have some peepers
UpliftingNews,removed,so you dont like to help the most unfortunate i take it
UpliftingNews,removed,hes really dark for a mexican
UpliftingNews,removed,or the article could be proving that every single crybaby liberal who complains that life for young people is too hard is completely full of shit
UpliftingNews,removed,if ur sleeping in a tent why the fuck r u biking six hours to do so just put the fucking tent closer
UpliftingNews,removed,okay the bike ride i understand but why did he do it two weeks early why not ask a friend to borrow their phone and call the school to find out when to be there in fact why not ask a friend for a ride if you can carry it on your back itl fit in your lap well i suppose school is where you go to learn problem solving skills
UpliftingNews,removed,i created a position for him before he walked in my door i didnt know his name i didnt know the color of his skin the stuff thats happening with police officers i am black and he didnt care what color i was he just helped me and that meant a lot barley said lol how progressive of you mrs journalist
UpliftingNews,removed,problem is lower class people already play the system and get more benefits than they need if middle class people could get the same sort of benefits we could have even more people playing the system also every solution to government issues involving money seems to be higher taxes on the wealthy but you can only use that a few times before you take too much from them so you have to pick and choose what programs you want to do that with
UpliftingNews,removed,what part of this is supposed to be uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,he should probably move his tent closer to school
UpliftingNews,removed,homeless can afford a smart phone stud ear rings kept head and facial hair clean clothes the title is playing on peoples heart too he rode his bike once to get to the campus then set up his tent and stayed until the dorms opened up still a crazy hike and huge sign of dedication dont get me wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,its as if they want people to feel symphaty for a specific race
UpliftingNews,removed,was i the only one who thought he was lucky he didnt get shot its awful to think like that but after the recent killings i am feeling like it is dangerous to be black in the usa
UpliftingNews,removed,if he is homeless why didnt he move closer
UpliftingNews,removed,if he is homeless why doesnt he live closer to college
UpliftingNews,removed,how about his new boss bragging that they will keep him employed and might eventually teach him to cook pizza even after she found out he was a black man ms abramson is a true saint folks
UpliftingNews,removed,if hes homeless then why wouldnt he set up his tent closer to the college
UpliftingNews,removed,he needs to pitch his tent closer to college

UpliftingNews,removed,if hes homeless surely he can just move his tent
UpliftingNews,removed,why doesnt he move his tent closer
UpliftingNews,removed,why is he biking hour every day if he is homeless why not set up tent closer
UpliftingNews,removed,kind of like a real life blindside
UpliftingNews,removed,couldnt he move his tent closer if he wanted
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe he should move his tent closer to school
UpliftingNews,removed,why not camp up an hour or minutes or even minutes away from the college
UpliftingNews,removed,if he sleeps in a tent why not move closer to college just saying
UpliftingNews,removed,lpt camp closer to college if your biking hours there
UpliftingNews,removed,if hes homeless why does he cycle so far away after classes
UpliftingNews,removed,uhmm why doesnt he move his mobile housing closer to college
UpliftingNews,removed,what an idiot why not sleep closer if your living in tent retard
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this uplifting news literally sad as fuck he must be sleeping like hours a day in a fucking tent i ride my bike a half hour each way to work every day and i cant even imagine hours my legs would be dead all day and id still have to go back i hope things get better for him
UpliftingNews,removed,if hes homeless why is he biking hours its not like he has to travel home again after class
UpliftingNews,removed,if hes homeless why does he have to bike hours
UpliftingNews,removed,anyone else get the feeling this casey chic is giving him more than just food and shelter lol
UpliftingNews,removed,move the tent closer to school
UpliftingNews,removed,scab him over a dole give him some alcohol fizzy drink medicinal cigarettes the works call it the poor ethnic kid package why i remember once a chinese man by the name of kevin rudd introduced a stimulus package which boosted the decimal readings of all local nightclubs as well as amphetamine sales and seizures on large scales tv sales went up young girls bought make up oh boy wasnt it a bohemian paradise the rise and fall of a city just with boy who would think
UpliftingNews,removed,why doesnt he just move his tent closer to school
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting news because he didnt get shot
UpliftingNews,removed,had me until he thought an omnipotent pastaspindle aviator controls his fate
UpliftingNews,removed,bro move your tent closer to college

UpliftingNews,removed,move the tent closer
UpliftingNews,removed,he shouldve become homeless closer to school
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont know many homeless people whose teeth look like that
UpliftingNews,removed,he should just move the tent
UpliftingNews,removed,i think hes just going to spend his career money on drugs lets stop him guys lets prevent him from going to school kidding but idk this world seems pretty scary
UpliftingNews,removed,and you have full grown adults crying on campus now when they see the name trump written in chalk they can learn a thing or two from this guy
UpliftingNews,removed,he should move his tent closer to college then hes not going to graduate if hes not smart enough to do that
UpliftingNews,removed,homeless bikes hours to get to school uplifting i mean based on our current everything he is working to get a degree that will leave him under mountains of debt someone should tell him that the dream he is chasing quickly turns into a nightmare
UpliftingNews,removed,why doesnt he just pack up the tent and bring it closer to the college
UpliftingNews,removed,bicycle can get you miles in no time pretty sweet he got a free car by bitching
UpliftingNews,removed,so there i was riding my bike to college when a coed comes up to me and says she needs about tree fiddy
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont think its a favor since this adds more monthly expenses to the poor guy he is better off just getting a bike or a mopet it is a very nice initiative and good intentions from the lady nonetheless
UpliftingNews,removed,why uh why doesnt he just move his tent closer to school i mean living in a tent is bad enough without forcing yourself to bike hours on top of that
UpliftingNews,removed,if hes homeless then why doesnt he just stay near the college
UpliftingNews,removed,so he has one job and plays pokemon go
UpliftingNews,removed,can someone please tell me how it is uplifting that a guy is working hours a week to make hed still be walking to his two jobs and broke if he hadnt gotten incredibly lucky and been given a car hell still be working poor after the fanfare is over
UpliftingNews,removed,when not move the tent closer to campus
UpliftingNews,removed,so what i biked miles to scool and back it isnt that big of a deal
UpliftingNews,removed,ummm times is also if hes so poor that he has to walk miles a day how is a car anything other than a month he cant afford
UpliftingNews,removed,lol at the girl trying to get a bunch of facebook karma
UpliftingNews,removed,i was gonna be a cunt and just comment on why he was dumb for not just getting jobs close together then i googled the dunkin donuts and where he lives theres seriously only like other businesses in the entire fucking town what a shitty situation for someone that actually wants to work
UpliftingNews,removed,son of a bitch didnt even get the extended warranty
UpliftingNews,removed,guy walks miles to pimp hoes attended juggalo university of murder
UpliftingNews,removed,its not so uplifting when you realize barely anyone in these situations can afford the taxes on what they won
UpliftingNews,removed,he actually got a dwi a few weeks later leaving the scene of an accident
UpliftingNews,removed,k now what about the millions of others struggling under equal or greater pressures no viral fb post no soup for you like the world caring about one person makes up for them not giving a tuck about millions more they ignore every day we helped one today were good
UpliftingNews,removed,that bitch is keeping him from hatching so many eggs
UpliftingNews,removed,lol at the dudes facebook i swear a lot and people think im racist
UpliftingNews,removed,depressingnews
UpliftingNews,removed,he probably makes more money
UpliftingNews,removed,would they have done it without a photo op cynic
UpliftingNews,removed,and he cant even afford the taxes on that gift or the gas to go in it thats why he was walking
UpliftingNews,removed,now he has to add gas and insurance to his budget well done i think a peddle bike would have been more appropriate
UpliftingNews,removed,grand now somebody pay the gas money insurance and taxes
UpliftingNews,removed,i think its a cool story the reason im so grumpy is that this lady helped do something nice but was a complete asshole with her photo caption
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet she just wants to get stuffed by the dude
UpliftingNews,removed,not everyone thinks a car is a godsend theyre incredibly expensive moreso than almost anybody realizes it doesnt end at the a year average to keep it running but the extreme amount of taxes that go into maintaining all this infrastructure which operates at a loss of the time and the public health costs starting at direct deaths a year in the us and countless more due to air quality and other indirect causes at best a car is an unfortunate necessity people would do well to rearrange their lives in such a way that they dont need one at all or can share one between many people
UpliftingNews,removed,youre assuming this story is actually true i smell something between exaggeration and outright bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,and a woman
UpliftingNews,removed,bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,read her photo caption in the article
UpliftingNews,removed,plot twist hes hittin that
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet shes an attention whore
UpliftingNews,removed,mmmminsurance
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah honestly she sounds fucking unsufferable it sounds less like she wants to help this guy and more like she wants some fame and platform to feel important just look at her body language in the picture front and center really her comments of im going to make you famous and her demands to make her post go viral then her stupid rant about working who the hell is she wtf does she know maybe im being cynical but she sounds like every other narcissistic tweener who wants her mins of fame i usually love these stories but i cant get over how obnoxious this girl seems
UpliftingNews,removed,so the trick is to have someone write a charismatic story about your hardships and voila free stuff they may be true but my instinct is to never believe these kind of uplifting human interest stories at first its just this tabloiding of news feeds and shared content
UpliftingNews,removed,looks like he may have been walking because his license was revoked due to a a couple of years ago hopefully he has a valid license now
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder if he hit it
UpliftingNews,removed,now if only she can get him a time machine with those puka shells that chinstrap and a accord he could be paying to support children by
UpliftingNews,removed,how many of you fucks would actually prefer to walk miles a day to work instead of just driving fucking idiots
UpliftingNews,removed,that hardworking man albert einstein
UpliftingNews,removed,the guy in detroit got way more than just a car and lets be honest here detroit is a total shit hole
UpliftingNews,removed,and now he has to pay car insurance pay for gas get maintenance done get a car seat for his child etc etc dude was prob better off getting a moped
UpliftingNews,removed,please dont act superior those people arent wrong he couldnt afford a car before he probably cant afford insurance and the taxes is uplifting that he got help but that help will most definitely be short lived
UpliftingNews,removed,what the heck is going in in this thread was everyone being a jerk today or something half the page is
UpliftingNews,removed,why do people want to lie to themselves just to feel better sorry but id rather have the truth the truth us that this story is probably very exaggerated
UpliftingNews,removed,whats with all the removed comments
UpliftingNews,removed,which is far better than receiving an entitlement check and doing nothing but watch tv all day
UpliftingNews,removed,nice next step is to lobby the dd and the convinience store owners to raise his salary so he can afford to maintain the car
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,and hes gonna shoot her again not with a gun but with his fake black cock you see hes gonna impregnate her when shes not looking and destroy the dna evidence in her with bleach and peroxide eeeeeeeeintuitive mmmm shhh mmmphgsh smmmposfhs not there noo not the grasy peanis dna evidence and the grip weakening idea of destroying it inside of human tissues
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck you negro
UpliftingNews,removed,kim jong un gave a flower to a little girl during one of his rallies upliftingnews now say something nice about kim jong un too pls
UpliftingNews,removed,you aint wrong mate pillar or zakah is all about giving away around of your income to the needy though no one stops you from making it more
UpliftingNews,removed,its not their age that impresses me but the resolve and hard work it would take to start from a parttime interest all the way through a phd program
UpliftingNews,removed,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

UpliftingNews,removed,who gives a shit there are hundreds of restaurants that do this muslims christians jewish etc it doesnt fucking matter they are no better or worse than any other religion in terms of doing good and bad so stop acting like it is so fucking special
UpliftingNews,removed,so those posts are meant for what europe sacrificed its whole culture safety and identity to help out those muslims and look what in return rape demolishing and abolishing of european culture good job
UpliftingNews,removed,its how they spread their hateful religion
UpliftingNews,removed,there is really nothing that makes me more happy on christmas then anything else other then getting free shish
UpliftingNews,removed,i can already imagine the headline trump uncovers terrorist plot muslimowned restaurant shutdown
UpliftingNews,removed,unless you are gay a woman or do not share their beliefs right
UpliftingNews,removed,islam is cancer
UpliftingNews,removed,it did all that and was stupid
UpliftingNews,removed,you just love balls dont yadont ya

UpliftingNews,removed,but in the end those idiots unintentionally spread awareness knowing about the disease was not required to help fund it they helped by making fools of themselves and since help was the entire point im grateful to every last fucking one of them
UpliftingNews,removed,we did it guys
UpliftingNews,removed,great for the jew nothing for the goy suckered into this

UpliftingNews,removed,im calling bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,wow httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfxdayuixphg
UpliftingNews,removed,when you blow up babies in cribs then youre not civil or serving
UpliftingNews,removed,what either youre or youre massively sheltered if you never heard of als before the ice bucket challenge
UpliftingNews,removed,the point of the ice bucket challenge was to have ice cold water was not a dare but a reenactment of sorts to give you a brain freeze which would sort of stimulate the feelings als sufferers have by walking in their shoes for a moments as it were you would theoretically be more emphatic to the cause
UpliftingNews,removed,exactly my friend was a retard but good definitely came out of the challenge
UpliftingNews,removed,good for them yet nobody took part in my rls mice bucket challenge wed have a cure for restless leg syndrome by now if people werent so uptight about getting a bucket full of mice dumped on them social media opportunist frauds the whole lot of you

UpliftingNews,removed,i can certainly make you a lovely graph on it if you want million dollars on a donationsfromicebucketchallenge scale on a vertical axis discovery of the genes on the horizontal axis and nothing else on either since these are the only things mentioned in the article would that aesthetically please you enough to figure out that this isnt exactly a science magazine reporting it or to make you realize how silly thatd look there great
UpliftingNews,removed,depression the real one you know that is a real sickness is hitting times more people and most of the time sadly there is no easy help for the people als is a joke compared to that but somehow the hype leads the research
UpliftingNews,removed,dont make these fb idiots feel good they would have found it anyway
UpliftingNews,removed,youre next super aids
UpliftingNews,removed,woostah
UpliftingNews,removed,now we just need the isis bucket challenge
UpliftingNews,removed,good thing it was found by a uber driver instead if state police officer is way too much money to have on you unless it is for drug trafficking purposesright
UpliftingNews,removed,this would not happen if it was a scumbag taxi driver taxi drivers are some if the worst people out there taking long ways when you dont know the area to make more money good for uber for breking their stupid overpriced monopoly
UpliftingNews,removed,lets see the taxi union do that
UpliftingNews,removed,giggity
UpliftingNews,removed,its not really that uplifting to me to read a story about how only christians do good things
UpliftingNews,removed,welcome to america search up miniladd uber worth of his computers camera and content were stolen after he accidentally left it in an uber he called back eventually had to call the police
UpliftingNews,removed,bucks hes just a weab that likes to pretend he forgets english or that hes so accustomed to japan he forgets to switch languages as an american who has been speaking japanese my whole life i can assure you that it never happens accidentally
UpliftingNews,removed,hes a weab pretends like he forgets to switch back to english because hes so in touch with japanese
UpliftingNews,removed,if he would have gone to puerto rico he would never see the money
UpliftingNews,removed,so whe did not being a thief become newsworthy its a cabbies job to take care of passenger property source used to be a taxi driver
UpliftingNews,removed,dummy thats free money
UpliftingNews,removed,good now he can use that money to gtfo
UpliftingNews,removed,guess that went over his head lol
UpliftingNews,removed,he could have given it to the company uber and in particular massive asshole travis kalanick could have used it when the successful lawsuits pile up for a hiring drivers that rape assault and even attempt to murder their passengers or simply drive around killing other people b not having adequate insurance be a requirement for their drivers c greatly exaggerating how much drivers will make d suckering some of those drivers into unethical and maybe even illegal motor vehicle purchases and payments e many clear labor law violations feel free to add your own
UpliftingNews,removed,uber not just rape anymore
UpliftingNews,removed,i find it sad that the reason for him to return the wallet was because he was a christian dont get me wrong its the noble thing to do but it kinda feeds the notion in my head that many christians would be complete assholes if they werent afraid of a mysterious floating being in space this might be why so many christians think atheists are immoral cause why would you be moral without fear sorry if im being a downer this is just a thought i had for a while
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah my wife left her waller in a cab in philly last year the cab guy did return the wallet but took the in it he said the passengers who found the wallet in the back seat might have taken the money plus charged us for coming back welcome to the real america

UpliftingNews,removed,so what he sucks
UpliftingNews,removed,i mean there was temptation ill be honest with you but me being a christian i couldnt every time i hear something like this i also hear now if i was a jew things would be different

UpliftingNews,removed,i once found a wallet with lots of cards and id and returned it at some time to myself i did pull out the that was in there when i found it he asked wheres ask the cash that was in here grumpily i told him that i found it with no cash i took over the court he was on right when he left so no one else touched the wallet he was pissed at me for not giving him his two bucks i should have just thrown the wallet in the creek

UpliftingNews,removed,where it causes coral reef bleaching on a massive scale misleading coral bleaching events are due to temperature shock increased water acidity influences the hardness of coral but thats a very different thing than bleaching and the current state of ocean ph is not a problem

UpliftingNews,removed,australia has been reluctant to protect endangered sharks from fishing in november the australian government agreed to grant species of sharks protection under a unadministered convention but two months later the government opted out of the agreement with respect to five of the species including two species of hammerhead sharks fuck the australian government
UpliftingNews,removed,wwf said it was now seeking funds to cover the cost of the licence how about they just go fishing for sharks and sell auction them as special wwf sharks
UpliftingNews,removed,wait youre complaining about them allowing shark fishing and stoping greyhound racing so youre concerned about the sharks but not concerned about the tens of thousands of greyhounds put down
UpliftingNews,removed,this sunday sunday sunday at the aqua slobbaknocka watch as the shark goes up against the reef in the is the money in the bank match due to global warming the match has been moved to wednesday
UpliftingNews,removed,from the top ropes
UpliftingNews,removed,shark populations are on the decline in the great barrier reef the reef is already dying as well from fishing and coral bleaching also trawl nets catch bycatch some of which can be endangered species you are ignorant and dumb to think there are plenty of sharks in the great barrier reef
UpliftingNews,removed,christ man nsfw that
UpliftingNews,removed,baw gawd that shark has a family damnit
UpliftingNews,removed,this sunday at the great barrier reef oh bah gawd its gonna be a slobberknocker

UpliftingNews,removed,how does dragging a net along a reef only target sharks
UpliftingNews,removed,one of the saddest tragedies of recent years was those environmentalists forcing wretling wwf to change its name
UpliftingNews,removed,define it
UpliftingNews,removed,this thread is a perfect microchasm oh how stupid the average redditor is instead of questioning why the austrialian government allows fishing over the great barrier reef people post links to donate more money maybe the problem isnt there is not enough money to buy these permits maybe these permits shouldnt be getting sold and then furthermore in promoting more donations to buy these permits theyre furthering the agenda of the people who came up with the permit in the first place yall are fucking retarded
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont get it why they want the shark to wrestle
UpliftingNews,removed,no sharks live where their prey lives as do dolphins whales etc theres no special shark net
UpliftingNews,removed,it just makes me wonder why we dont listen to experts then i remember that politicians are typically pure evil representing a minority of people who have control of most of the resources generally the people with the resources also inherited their start in life they most likely didnt do anything to earn it therefore they have no idea what responsibility is
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting

UpliftingNews,removed,by this reasoning if a man were to leave his estate to his kids to do with as they saw fit and we heard they sold the family acreage that had been in their line for generations to a condo developer so they could buy spinning rims for their cars and spend months of the year in aruba i think wed be just fine pulling our hair out despite the instruction of as they see fit in the will

UpliftingNews,removed,what a terrible slap in the face to her father the article didnt really mention what if any involvement he has had over the years but it did mention he had been opposed to it
UpliftingNews,removed,no says stepdad
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah i also read this as being really shitty im sure her actual dad would have much preferred to have lived with his kids but you know women always get custody so when she says her stepdad took on the fatherly role what she means is that her stepdad lived in the house with her mom thats not your dad sweetheart thats the guy who fucked your mom after she left your dad and got the house and kids
UpliftingNews,removed,old news is super fucking old
UpliftingNews,removed,lol he is a literal cuckold

UpliftingNews,removed,on a serious note im happy for them on a non serious note this is florida girl her stepdad is florida man does she seriously want this lady florida man is just crazy im not sure you thought about this at all in the next story florida man threw an alligator at someone
UpliftingNews,removed,raising chads spawngee wheez what a fucking mangina this isnt uplifting this is disgusting and should be shamedthis simply saying that its okay for a woman to just have children at will without the importance of her biological father bc someone else will come take care of the garbage for youzero responsibility zero accountability this is what this is
UpliftingNews,removed,not really uplifting now legally if they split he has to pay child support and she could go after him for years of back support
UpliftingNews,removed,this sounds like a bad porno
UpliftingNews,removed,so she considers herself a gift to him
UpliftingNews,removed,the best part is they can have sex to celebrate and it wouldnt be sick or illegal
UpliftingNews,removed,i mean thats thats great but why why is that news

UpliftingNews,removed,heres to hoping the marine guy she married ends up fucking murdering her one day
UpliftingNews,removed,others are saying spend time but its more about having quality time meaning time in which youre having many positive interactions with each other try to find a hobby with each of them or all of them if youre time limited which realistically most of us are that you both enjoy and are able to participate in to a meaningful degree this might mean introducing them into one of your hobbies it might mean introducing yourself into one of theirs or it might mean if all your current interests are incompatible like if theyre a toddler and your sole interest is fine literature taking up something completely new hobbies that can be fun for both parties regardless of age include sports outdoors stuff like hikingcampingfishinggardening helping with their favourite school subject storytelling creating artmusic visiting cafes or cooking and eating food yourself multiplayer video games and moviestv can work too but personally i recommend against them as they provide so much sensory input that the more a child uses them the less they are able to enjoy those other more sedate activities which will begin to feel comparatively boring if you must at least try to limit the amount and during the activity maintain as much social interaction as possible eg with tv constantly discuss how the characters are feeling shocking events your and their predictions for the plot etc as a side note when youre introducing them to a new hobby its essential to monitor how theyre progressing and handling things sometimes kids if their personality is a little withdrawn will be frustrated when faced with anything new whatsoever and in these cases its just a matter of guiding hem gently by the hand until they reach a point of familiaritymastery other times though youve picked an activity that just genuinely has no potential to interest them as an extreme example a deaf kid is not going to enjoy painting but in the real world youll encounter much subtler variants of this like if you go on a hike one of your kids might be too weak or sickly to comfortably maintain the marching pace of the others and yet if you slow the others down theyll become bored also do ensure its something you can enjoy as well kids can tell when youre pretending to be engaged and for yourself genuinely not needing to pretend is a godsend
UpliftingNews,removed,in order to make the sex more kinky

UpliftingNews,removed,i know it seems like this is an incredibly nice thing to do but really is it i mean hes a repo man its his job to repossess peoples vehicles no one likes getting their vehicle repossessed so why is nice when he decides to pay off an elderly couples car but no one elses through any path of logic thats not a nice thing to do either he decided only to be nice to this elderly couple which means he put their needs above the needs of all the other peoples cars he repossessed and didnt pay off the only thing we can assume about these elderly people is that they had to have their car repossessed for all we know they could be cooking meth why is it nice to help one very specific person while choosing to ignore so many others ill agree that any act of kindness is still an act of kindness but i dont understand why he chose to prioritize an elderly couple over any of the other people whos vehicles he repossessed thats profiling and thats not a nice thing to do yet here we are praising this man for putting himself in the powerful position of deciding who deserves more kindness i think it would have been nicer to help everyone but since thats not feasible the nicest thing to do would have been nothing at all and i bet all the people whos vehicles hes repossessed in the past would agree with me and if your response is well they deserved it then why didnt the elderly couple

UpliftingNews,removed,if they really were close he might have been able to have sex without even drugging her
UpliftingNews,removed,lol of all the weird things you could have come up with you settled in liquefied boggers love it
UpliftingNews,removed,oh yeah of course
UpliftingNews,removed,thats what im wondering i mean it seems like it was meant to drug her and well occams razor and all but part of me is wondering if it was just something really silly or extremely gross like you said the tests from the lab came back its tears in an interview room nearby i just i love her so much yknow i cry myself to sleep thinking about being with her so i thought maybe if she tasted my sadness she might finally understand we belong together which is just as disturbed but at least weird rather than rapey
UpliftingNews,removed,and that picture ruined it
UpliftingNews,removed,its nicotine hes trying to build her dependence on him
UpliftingNews,removed,im guessing she was the hot one
UpliftingNews,removed,this reminds me of an analogy some girl online told in response to the frequent argument not all men are bad theres a bowl of mms a few of them are poisoned go ahead eat one initially i thought this was such a petty sentiment but stuff like this where a girl cant even trust one of her self described best friends
UpliftingNews,removed,to be honest im scared of showing that im sexually interested in a woman only to have her post my private information on the internet slander me and ruin my life just because she didnt like something i said men are generally more physically powerful but these days a woman can ruin a mans life with a single tweet like this and remember this
UpliftingNews,removed,where do people get these drugs i dont want to use them on others just myself how awesome to take a pull and be out for a day why waste it on a date its probably cheaper to get a hooker
UpliftingNews,removed,i saw them on rcringeanarchy earlier
UpliftingNews,removed,guys who have been friendzoned can be very dangerous as they have little to lose the reason is they never really were friends
UpliftingNews,removed,could do without the sex in the city version of the charlies angels pose
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope that hes just a concerned friend who is worrying about her becoming an alcoholic and not eating right so he slips her vitamin and mineral supplements whenever he can he probably isnt but wouldnt it be nice
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope he kills himself in jail frankly
UpliftingNews,removed,this is so american

UpliftingNews,removed,just like the military industrial complex dont fix it just uphold it
UpliftingNews,removed,and therefor fucking uselesspointless if he has fallen friends and wants to honor them go visit their families visit their graves go talk to other veterans this is just stupid patriotism doing nothing of importance and symbolism doesnt mean a fucking thing at the end of the day this is a guy wasting his day on a meaningless piece of cloth that flag means nothing its just a fucking flag what it stands for is much more important and instead of holding a fucking flag and getting praised for it he could have been doing something else much more worthwhile and being happy to help out of the public eye of all the shit we could point out all the patriotic acts all the good deeds that could be done today and noted we give a shit about a guy needlessly holding a flag all day i get it whatever floats your boat but redditors are a bunch of morons for thinking this was somehow an important or memorable act id rather someone go serve soup to one of our many homeless vets wheres the recognition for them because i promise you theres plenty that were doing that today and they deserve the limelight rant fucking hate stupid blind patriotism fuck flags and symbolism

UpliftingNews,removed,fishing for attention
UpliftingNews,removed,christ
UpliftingNews,removed,utterly brain washed
UpliftingNews,removed,there is a definite limit on where patriotism turns in to something ugly and this is it it is just a flag on a yard somewhere not a holy relic so either it was plea for attention to vet treatment good subject to shout how angry you are with that legitimate issue or it is sick nationalism if its latter it is latter no one is thinking about vets then we need to burn ten flags for every hour that moron stood there showing his patriotic boner think he would do this in the middle of forest nope he was after an audience to show how patriotic he is this is why wars are being waged if you think your country is so exceptional to warrant this behavior it by default means rest of the countries arent so while it is commendable to do something like this it is still a sign of greater sickness
UpliftingNews,removed,the definition of american porn
UpliftingNews,removed,then he called everyone he knew and said come take a picture of me so everyone knows that im doing this
UpliftingNews,removed,americans are fucking weird

UpliftingNews,removed,conspiracy theorists think that no one died at columbine sandy aurora pulse etc ban them from this site
UpliftingNews,removed,this is rupliftingnews worthy in america but rtodayilearned to most other countries where people wouldnt even consider having to pay their own medical expenses after an attack like this heck the very idea of it is disgusting what the fuck is wrong with the usa note americans individually are great the country itself seems absurd on a lot of shit
UpliftingNews,removed,i shouldnt have laughed at this but i hollered

UpliftingNews,removed,oh yeah and the whole islam thing but that too
UpliftingNews,removed,youre not making a point everyone isnt already aware of the fact of the matter is that paying taxes into a universal system is much fucking cheaper than paying for premiumsdeductiblescopays in the american system theres a blatantly obvious reason why americans pay way more for healthcare than anyone else
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry that a fanatical islamic terrorist shot you simply because you are gay and obama refuses to even mention the word islam and instead blames inanimate objects like guns and workplace violence but here is a coupon for one free surgery i will stand with the muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction barack hussein obongo

UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile in a civilised country like the uk no hospital bills anyone you would think that if america wants to keep its guns so much that you guys would at least get a better healthcare system that works for everyone especially all those poor people who get shot but cant even afford to pay the hospital to allow them to live

UpliftingNews,removed,bust the statistics that show that refugees in germany are as criminal as natural citizens proof that show that rape and murder is going down im not sure about germany but britains murder rate is higher than it was in the and this is with modern medical technology obfuscating the figures see
UpliftingNews,removed,umm she cut the fat off she does not deserve praise
UpliftingNews,removed,why do you think she took the photos before the surgery she did not legitimately work to lose that weight sorry
UpliftingNews,removed,shes still fat as fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,murder rate has steadily gone down since im not comparing to thats like comparing two different shades of shit im comparing europebritain prepoz and before to postpoz and after supposition where does it use this word exactly due to immigration no shit you think importing millions of uneducated random muslims from the shittiest area in pakistan mirpur isnt going to have an effect on crime whats your position exactly do you think all races commit all types of crime at exactly the same rate lol
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre just peace loving people who search for
UpliftingNews,removed,im not italian
UpliftingNews,removed,were these racially motivated were they systematic did they involve the collusion of dozens of police officers all over the relevant precinctcounty was there a systematic attempt by authorities at the highest level to cover them up for fearing of offending a particular group no then they arent equivalent
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre just born americans committing acts of terror against people they know literally nothing about because they think theyre smarter than our intelligence agencies following a series of raids in april eight somali friends were charged with conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization what acts of terror have americans exhibited to muslim immigrants
UpliftingNews,removed,they codle the same people that statistically hate christians
UpliftingNews,removed,america is a nation founded by europeans with european ideals for europeanwestern immigrants some cultures are incompatible with american culture like some muslim countries today
UpliftingNews,removed,i didnt say that at all im simply pointing out that theyre not all innocent like some people on the far left love to believe
UpliftingNews,removed,no they are not really really are not terrorists come in many shapes and sizes dictators on the other hand are usually left leaning like hitler or stalin who were absoloutely left
UpliftingNews,removed,you can you need to lock the boarders tight and make it all but impossible to come in make people work for it theyll appreciate being here much more if they dont want to work for it by learning english or whatever the host countrys language is they dont come in oh and abolish islam its wholly incompatible with modern civilization in its current form so either islam gets a new testament or we dont let any more muslims in easily
UpliftingNews,removed,i want to talk to you now please please listen and reflect you are delusional you are using right wing as an attack guess what things that come out of the left or right bad good and between what matters is the argument nothing more you are currently yelling anything you dont like is racist jew hating gay hating mysogynist etc get a grip on reality and stop thinking that everyone that doesnt think the way you think is disgusting pieces of shit
UpliftingNews,removed,yes if you did any research or knew your foot from your ass you would know extremely well that hitler and the nazi party were very left actually you dont really need to do much research just look at there name nazi socialist party
UpliftingNews,removed,far right terrorist am i missing something here of all the muslim attacks and failed muslim attacks why are they not called terrorist
UpliftingNews,removed,glenn dies in the walking dead
UpliftingNews,removed,follow up candle light vigil cut short when muslims kill no believers
UpliftingNews,removed,my point is how come none of the muslims attacks that have happened arent labled terrorist nor the muslim plots that have been foiled in the past year these arent called terrorist plots either still waiting for the terrorist who shot up the military base in texas to be called a terrorist the guy who shot up that night club still isnt called a terrorist but i guess calling to allah when youre murdering people doesnt count as terrorism
UpliftingNews,removed,farright terrorists you mean people who dont want a religion that supports beating wifes and killing gays in their country
UpliftingNews,removed,hitler was a socialist nazi is a slur for national socialist
UpliftingNews,removed,thats the point you fucking retarded invalid its not an objective source no one thinks youre special for being dumb enough to buy into the racist shit against your own culture seriously do us all a favour and go kill yourself
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah how dare i care about the systematic sexual abuse of girls as young as among my own group
UpliftingNews,removed,proof for each of those assertions please
UpliftingNews,removed,theyre the worst muslims in the entire fucking world and thats saying something hah
UpliftingNews,removed,that title is as shitty as your political bias go shove your stereotypes up your ass
UpliftingNews,removed,lets see if their tune changes when a couple of church members are raped by a terrorist migrant
UpliftingNews,removed,tell me why muslims arent labeled as terrorist thats all im asking the man who shot up for hood in texas in the name of allah why isnt he called a terrorist after the years it has happened
UpliftingNews,removed,build a wall is really the only way walls dont stop legal stuff from coming through semi permeable membrane baby cells have them too
UpliftingNews,removed,abuse and rape of predominantly black women race just for the record are you claiming that black women are more likely to be victimized by white men than white women are by black men in terms of sexual assault there a lot more then highlight where it lines up with the assertions you initially offered
UpliftingNews,removed,the president of the united states refused to call the shooting at fort hood a terror attack as well as the pulse shootings but so quick to call any attacks by a white man acts of terror
UpliftingNews,removed,im glad they were targeted
UpliftingNews,removed,political stunt gotta make the evil white males look bad at every opportunity wouldnt want people to focus on actual problems or anything
UpliftingNews,removed,the left wing media really are brainwashing people to think their fellow countrymen are the bad guys not wanting muslims islam the religion of death in to a countries because they are violent they rape they kill the have no respect this is propaganda dont buy into this
UpliftingNews,removed,are you kidding same shit happens on a weekly basis and there are regularly stories about people being killed in traffic accidents around here just passed a fatal car accident scene two weeks ago
UpliftingNews,removed,the only thing ive learned from all of this is that the only people who can be terrorist in the us are white males
UpliftingNews,removed,right right wing extremists are such a huge problem globally there are like billion white people and like nearly half of them hold extremist views with widespread violent terrorists attacks happening every day around the world because of those damn white people or is that muslims i forget
UpliftingNews,removed,lol okay but you have to admit if there was a failed muslim terror attack and white people had a candle light vigil for the victims a lot of people would say they were doing it to stir up hate for muslims which is exactly what they are doing here to white people
UpliftingNews,removed,the first ever dick pic
UpliftingNews,removed,seems like the plane ticket wouldnt be worth the reward
UpliftingNews,removed,im not even white and every single day the words make more and more sense becuase of shit like this
UpliftingNews,removed,and the response it is perfectly acceptable to be racist to white people now white people will soon be a minority and everyone seems to think thats a good thing can you imagine the shit storm if some primarily black country was on its way to being mostly white these days
UpliftingNews,removed,the problem is that most people think that is a good thing and in a lot of cases it is intentional because of the voter demographics how is it not a problem that at this rate there will be no white people eventually
UpliftingNews,removed,ill take illegal weed every day for a year and you do the same with legal opioids then tell me about frying your brain
UpliftingNews,removed,heres whats worse at the end of article buffington flew to new hampshire to deliver the message to pierce she made good on the promised reward so he bought a plane ticket to personally deliver it and the cheap bitch gave him cash for the year old memorabilia
UpliftingNews,removed,do you think the extinction of the white race is a good thing
UpliftingNews,removed,no it isnt lol there is a culture and all kinds of stuff what if i was like yeah we should totally eliminate the aboriginals thats called genocide native americans have their own little sovreign nation reservations around jews have israel absolutely fucking nobody in immigrating to the middle east or indonesia try immigrating to japan the point is every race and culture has their homeland and protects their homeland culture and way of life except white people anytime there is even an attempt to put reasonable restrictions of immigration or any sort of nationalism at all racist racist fucking white supremacist nazi bastard look at japan big economy beautiful culture ect why isnt there a huge political movement to force japan to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees and millions of immigrants from countries with weaker economies because white people are the only ones its okay to try to wipe off the face of the earth and thats why i kind of understand where white nationalists are coming from despite the fact that my entire family and i are latino
UpliftingNews,removed,you arent very smart
UpliftingNews,removed,im not advocating making america the homeland of the white race i was just saying every country that was traditionally white is being flooded with immigrants except iceland though your right i hadnt thought of them a tiny island with a small population and an almost non existent military sounds like the perfect place to gather all the white people
UpliftingNews,removed,well yeah i didnt mean all the whites should like return to their homeland of iceland im just saying i think its perfectly legitimate for white nationalists to feel they way they do i mean you said it yourself you dont care if white people and their culture become a thing of the past
UpliftingNews,removed,moderators should change your word usage you cater to all the softies on this website now cater to me i find it offensive that dick is used to describe an unruly person i have a dick and its not a hard a it doesnt spit on peo it doesnt swear its always standing up for what it feels is right
UpliftingNews,removed,on mobile in airport ill try to remember for later
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,my dad would fish here
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,this looks like a title cowritten by ucommahorror
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel it is still not good enough i still feel vigilante justice has a key role to play we cant allow the ceo of mylan to get away with behaving like that it just perpetuates the belief that is it acceptable it is not acceptable and we need to smash her down and her family down to prove it to the rest of those fuckers out there the middle class will not longer be tramped underfoot by shitheaaaddsss sry had to get that out of my system
UpliftingNews,removed,this dude is as good as assassinated
UpliftingNews,removed,whos trained to risk his life for the fat fucks that shoot other peoples dogs for fun
UpliftingNews,removed,all police dogs are simply mangy muttsbasically worthless
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile over half of the police dogs who died were from dumbass cops leaving them in hot cars
UpliftingNews,removed,this is great news time t get ma guun
UpliftingNews,removed,now lets see what happens when all the kids in the ghetto do the same thing downvote away
UpliftingNews,removed,im happy for the lgbt but dudes kissing still grosses me out

UpliftingNews,removed,why do we need political parties period best person for the job gets it we dont get asked our party affiliation when applying for most all jobs yet
UpliftingNews,removed,when he was she was
UpliftingNews,removed,are you triggered
UpliftingNews,removed,you dont know what a trigger law is evidently they are laws that are cannot be enforced due to current legislation but will be enforceable if circumstances change i am aware of the restrictions on abortion yes if roe v wade was the holding decision wed return to our original laws roe v wade is the case that legalized abortion you ignoramus planned parenthood v casey only abolished the trimester limits placed by the court during roe v wade though it upheld that abortion should only be legal until the fetus is viable
UpliftingNews,removed,when i say kaepernicks sacrifice aint much this guy is what im comparing him to
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe the kid is a jerk and is going to grow up to be a jerk i mean cop
UpliftingNews,removed,hes going to be broke in a few years what a waste of money and talent
UpliftingNews,removed,arsenic candies would have been more efficient
UpliftingNews,removed,could this be done far more cheaply by teaching the homeless about adverse possession
UpliftingNews,removed,dammit now everyone will want to be homeless
UpliftingNews,removed,crack heads have been doing this for years
UpliftingNews,removed,i feel like it would benefit them more to teach them skill sets to survive in this world because ive taught myself a plethora of skill sets gotten an education and can still barely afford my own housing which is drastically more expensive than the these folks have to pay and if you help those a little further up the totem pole your most recent children the millennial the ones everyone is expecting to save the world and help others it would be so much easier to do what needs to be done
UpliftingNews,removed,if you can quote me where i said anything like this ill donate to the charity of your choice if not you donate to the charity of ny choice plz fuck off
UpliftingNews,removed,take that rlatestagecapitalism oh wait nonprofit
UpliftingNews,removed,oh no but lets just give them nicely fixed up homes to grow crazy in
UpliftingNews,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
UpliftingNews,removed,i live in detroit while im sure most will call it the hood ghetto or worse its home to mostly decent working people i have many abondoned homes on my block id rather have it empty then full of homeless guys if they started doing this on my block we would probably burn the houses down
UpliftingNews,removed,homes that people got kicked out of for not paying the mortgage so now theyre homeless
UpliftingNews,removed,sees guy walking and detains him because he thought he was in trouble haha great story they basically admitted he was stopped for wwb walking while black
UpliftingNews,removed,please for gods sake i have a serious or rather several mental illnesses i managed to work for thirty years i always worried about having a job and health insurance i mean worried real worried due to two other health related issues one chronic and one acute i could no longer work i reside in the rust belt and the good jobs were banished due to corporate takeovers plus being mis diagnosed and wrong meds i am bi polar two i do not drink nor take any non prescribed drugs there is a joint and some percocet here that my mom used for her pain she is i dont want any of these in fact i am now icing with four ice packs due to over usei love to walk and try to use exercise to overcome some depression i try i see a doctor on a regular basis and take meds daily i hope i never have another relapse as i have had two suicide attempts and well i would not have minded being let to pass on my well off siblings and child are rather indifferent and dont help financially seems i did not try hard enough though being sick since a young child i would just like a little more benefits to have a little better life i work hard to try to have a normal life i just hope that today my legs ease up with better hydration and stretches and ointment walking is the vital key for me i have nothing without it i look funny laying here with my four ice packs i want to remain in our home forever mom has been here years besides my ssdi there are no food stamps or other assistance ty for letting me express my self
UpliftingNews,removed,gotta wonder how long itll last or how well itll go the whole thing makes me remember the post a few months back on the family that let a homeless family live rent free in their home while they were living out of state on the condition they look after the owners pets end result was a totally trashed house and almost all the pets dead after a few months was just crazy
UpliftingNews,removed,hud is fucking the poor as usual
UpliftingNews,removed,did the owners of those house consent to this otherwise it is breaking and entering
UpliftingNews,removed,actually its drugs the majority of them are fucking drug addicts who do not want to work at least it is here in canada or they are aboriginals which expect handouts from the government because they have been coddled by them for so long partly our fault its truth you dont want to hear too bad
UpliftingNews,removed,eta to the homes being trashed and condemned
UpliftingNews,removed,it will be hard for them to get better even when they are in a home they need medical intervention before they are put back into main stream society miain stream society is incredibly stressful for those with inadequate coping mechanism
UpliftingNews,removed,in related news vacant homes wrecked
UpliftingNews,removed,working poor who can barely afford rent or medical insurance get to struggle people who dont even try get free housing got it
UpliftingNews,removed,this will be shut down i guarantee it
UpliftingNews,removed,definitely went to school with that news lady very odd to see her on the front page of reddit
UpliftingNews,removed,most homeless dont want housingharvard already studied this
UpliftingNews,removed,dont let the blm folks find out about this
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah but now those houses and yards are trashed and the neighborhood has gone to shit
UpliftingNews,removed,they keep trying this those houses will be boarded up and uninhabitable in less than a year if nearly every single other case is an example
UpliftingNews,removed,this seems like a slow way to destroy houses
UpliftingNews,removed,nobody is saying oh its their fault they should have to suffer for it theyre saying the problems which led to them being homeless in the first place almost universally stop them from being a good homeowner youre putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound and throwing good housing away this is not the first time this has been tried likely the houses will be wrecked and the people will be back on the street
UpliftingNews,removed,oh man i hope they dont plan on reselling those houses
UpliftingNews,removed,thats great and all but i can almost guarentee that all these houses are going to be disgusting pig stines after being lived in for a month or two my city did something similiar for two homeless men and after a few months the houses had to be condemned because there was litteral shit piss and garbage allll over the inside and outside
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah i would love if the vacant house next door to me was filled with drug addled mentally damaged vagrants should make the of july block party a blast
UpliftingNews,removed,link to donate
UpliftingNews,removed,hey the entire country isnt in the shitter so whats your excuse why isnt everything as good for everyone else as it is for me
UpliftingNews,removed,lets hope none of those people live in charlotte nc thanks blm
UpliftingNews,removed,you have amazing people like this in the world and you have terrible people like mylan ceo in the world
UpliftingNews,removed,i might smell of socialism right now new fragrance old smell but this has struck me as odd before i do understand the inherent meaning of value and that giving a house away is bad business and all those words that some people seem to give such deep importance but china does have a communistic regime or whatever it is and a few towns that are totally deserted combine that with a shitload of syrians that lack a proper country perhaps we could invite them to the same party as the chineese could someone who speaks arabic and mandarine do the introductions please ill be in the bar
UpliftingNews,removed,thisll get buried but hey look rdenver solutions enough with the fucking homelessaddict hate already
UpliftingNews,removed,thats nice and all but there are thousands of people dont fall in to the i have it bad so nobody deserves to be helped trap
UpliftingNews,removed,and here i am paying rent like a sucker
UpliftingNews,removed,are you very antiabortion because you yourself was aborted
UpliftingNews,removed,this sort of preachy agendadriven crap doesnt belong in this sub
UpliftingNews,removed,im sure this will end well
UpliftingNews,removed,holy shit as a landlord that is a great idea stuff people per bedroom instead of renting out the whole house and make more money problem is when they stop paying and u have to evict them good luck with that
UpliftingNews,removed,the houses will be destroyed and the wide majority of the homeless will be back on the streets shortly and liberal handwringers who write things like the below in the comment section are hilarious if not for my suspicion that they come from the mouths of one of the tens of thousands of ngo futile money pits this nation is spitting out now to sum up the idea in a nutshell many people arent homeless because theyre addicts theyre addicts because theyre homeless hah okay if you say so stop the circle jerc
UpliftingNews,removed,then they proceed to destroy the homes and the value of those around them
UpliftingNews,removed,youre fucked in the head you dont get to redefine words or history to fit into your narrative
UpliftingNews,removed,new crack houses
UpliftingNews,removed,i cant imagine many people arent homeless because they were lazy
UpliftingNews,removed,and thus lowering everyone elses profit value and increasing crime rates yay
UpliftingNews,removed,fecesfilled houses of horror id wager
UpliftingNews,removed,why would the homeless do that when squatting is both free and legally binding
UpliftingNews,removed,theyll be back on the street within months watch the documentary dark days
UpliftingNews,removed,wheres my free house
UpliftingNews,removed,i hate when people use the word non profit as if it indicated a nice motive theres no reason to mention non profit the organization has a name just because they are giving homes to the homeless and call themselves non profit doesnt mean this organization is like jesus or something
UpliftingNews,removed,then after the homeless people strip the homes of copper wiring and pipes a lawyer comes in and convinces them they have the right to sue the nonprofit now that the property is no longer up to code
UpliftingNews,removed,so since this works how long before republicans hear about it and ban it
UpliftingNews,removed,well thats one way to destroy vacant homes good thing no ones tax dollars will be spent fixing them latter no wait of coarse there will be
UpliftingNews,removed,they will trash the fuck out of these homes
UpliftingNews,removed,communism uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile we just took in a few thousand refugees in my town
UpliftingNews,removed,well i didnt read the article but my opinion is those vacant home are going to be trashed so bad and itll be disgusting i sometimes have to clean shanty towns that homeless were staying in theres wicked nasty stuff that goes down its bad
UpliftingNews,removed,because it is cancerous to society as a whole and slowly works to destroy the family structure this is not a new phenomenon to humanity the erosion of sexual identity has been a hallmark of the downfall of a society all throughout human history
UpliftingNews,removed,backwards for not wanting to normalize and praise mental illness and body mutilation thats called degeneracy
UpliftingNews,removed,this if a man wants to cut off his own dick and pretend hes a woman let him
UpliftingNews,removed,disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,hes not transgender hes clearly a biological man he just has a psychological disorder
UpliftingNews,removed,most people dont pal get off your computer and join the real world
UpliftingNews,removed,ah so they cant do the one thing that defines males cool
UpliftingNews,removed,mental illnesses are being celebrated
UpliftingNews,removed,dont get me wrong women with fake dicks are equally as disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,why should people get to choose what bathroom they use its pretty simple you look between your legs and then if you see a dick you go in the male one if you see a pussy you go in the female one some of this shit that trannies cry about is just fucking stupid i mean i get it that they have a mental illness but you cant expect the rest of the world to adjust because you think you are something youre not
UpliftingNews,removed,disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,its not hate or ignorance a lot of normal people just dont like glorifying mental illnesses
UpliftingNews,removed,uh thats nasty
UpliftingNews,removed,anyone can get a perfect gpa if they take years to get their degree
UpliftingNews,removed,of course retards shouldnt be allowed to carry loaded weapons what a ridiculous suggestion
UpliftingNews,removed,sadly underneath its still a woman and no matter what she will never have the physical abilities of a man and always carry the physical limitations of a womans body like should a transgender male to female fight a woman he still has the edge as a male and will pulverize a woman as weve seen happen a man is a man and a woman is a woman no matter how you dice it a man is about to stronger men have larger lungs stronger heart higher red blood cells stronger joints and ligaments pelvis is stronger they clearly have the edge and in a serous physical attack she will go down like a female would you cant change that it aint a man
UpliftingNews,removed,tranny heshes are disgusting
UpliftingNews,removed,so does he have a vajayjay lol
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting thats revolting and offensive
UpliftingNews,removed,his art always reminded me of now bland art can be when not done by someone with a good eye for aesthetics
UpliftingNews,removed,and this is uplifting how
UpliftingNews,removed,assbutt
UpliftingNews,removed,yea because the article didnt even bother to mention it at least im not a retard that thinks that testosterone treatments changes your gender
UpliftingNews,removed,so does tori have a penis now or a vagina did he do the surgery how much does it cost anyway
UpliftingNews,removed,he cis scum
UpliftingNews,removed,if it wasnt ken goddamn bone himself to help out
UpliftingNews,removed,please dont pin this
UpliftingNews,removed,is it news every time a christian or secular organization opens a clinic
UpliftingNews,removed,really obnoxious
UpliftingNews,removed,no thanks
UpliftingNews,removed,its funny that you actually think dumb sjw fads are going to still be around in a decades
UpliftingNews,removed,ye i bet they laugh their asses off behind their backs and give it worst of jobs
UpliftingNews,removed,i also heard some people heal by having their dog licking their wounds not sure if its hygienic in both cases i think i would consider selfsurgery first
UpliftingNews,removed,no
UpliftingNews,removed,no they can treat woman after their familys throw acid in their faces for having sex before marriage or driving
UpliftingNews,removed,wonderful news now if we can just convert the zoos to sanctuaries then humanity would be half human again
UpliftingNews,removed,lol youre a true believer
UpliftingNews,removed,i hate seeing police officer getting praised for doing something kind theyre goddamn supposed too help out people whenever they need
UpliftingNews,removed,my muslim pakistani friend said she was probably a whore asking for it what was she doing at a concert in the first place shame on her family etc some cultures eh
UpliftingNews,removed,where did i refer to him as a she he is certainly true and real once again want to verify
UpliftingNews,removed,except it is offensive for a man to intervene to protect a woman or even to imply that a woman may need a man to rescue her women have agency and are just as strong as men and are therefore strong enough to protect themselves if men step in to protect or rescue a woman this is implying that women are not as strong as men and need male protection and if this is so then men and women are not in fact equal in characteristics or capabilities therefore this singers act of helping to defend this woman is clearly an act of misogyny because he is demonstrating his superior power and taking away her agency by asserting that she is not strong enough to protect herself
UpliftingNews,removed,some people are assholes some men harass other men and women and treat them like shit his stating that this could be a daughtermother probably doesnt matter to the person and because some small percentage of men are assholes you should not worry about us as a group it sounds like you may have some underlying issues to deal with are you afraid all muslims are terrorists that want you do die because a very small percentage of them are extremists
UpliftingNews,removed,there is a lot of boundaries that some people ignore because they are female and doing something to a male on more occasions than id like to admit people at work have been grabbed me or touched me in ways i didnt find appropriate or want amazing though how often it can be joked off by managersemployeesone girl kept harassing me and i had people than harassing me for being upset about it like seriously
UpliftingNews,removed,its more present because you are paying more attention it is almost exactly like the people in runcensorednews and how they are overly focused on migrant crime in europe you know how when you learn a new word you suddenly notice it everywhere the baadermeinhof phenomenon people call it
UpliftingNews,removed,i do not think flossing has been posted and discussed in the usa set up a good milestone
UpliftingNews,removed,who my friends are in my head
UpliftingNews,removed,i went to a cannibal corpse show once everyone was beating up everyone cannibal corpse definitely did not stop
UpliftingNews,removed,funny since all the floss i ever used says made in ireland on the side its just one big conspiracy by europeans to trick americans into buying oral hygiene products
UpliftingNews,removed,youre a faggot bitch suck my cock
UpliftingNews,removed,no you will never hear anything else about this ever again
UpliftingNews,removed,because thats how virtually every single scientific or medical related breakthrough ends up its sad and disappointing the opposite of uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,what the fuck is a cisgender and if it doesnt matter why disclosei dont go around screaming i screwed a chick i screwed a chick
UpliftingNews,removed,if those were the statistics you were referring to then your original comment is very misleading its silly to argue that police shooting unarmed people especially young black guys is justified because youve never had a bad experience with copsthats as bad as the antivaxxers saying well my kid has never had measles therefore vaccines arent necessary statistics show otherwise doesnt seem to have anything to do with the occupational fatality of officers and everything to do with black encounters with the police
UpliftingNews,removed,waste of tax dollars what an idiot
UpliftingNews,removed,the officer didnt shoot him the main stream media has my mind going to unsavory places
UpliftingNews,removed,bull shit the cop shot him and this is a cover up follow the media narrative
UpliftingNews,removed,how was the cop not fired for doing that im sure dispatch was pissed after hearing unless he asked his supervisor for permission
UpliftingNews,removed,he had a warrant he should have been arrested this isnt a kind gesture this is the cop flat out ignoring the law and a judges orders but i guess its cool to ignore laws and judges when it benefits blmthe left
UpliftingNews,removed,ironic that his sister died by some dumb punk yet he then behaved like a dumb punk
UpliftingNews,removed,anyone else read the comments on his post fuck
UpliftingNews,removed,plot twist the cop was the sister murderer
UpliftingNews,removed,delete this a white cop being nice to a black man fake im triggereddddd
UpliftingNews,removed,this the blm movement is too hostile to even be taken seriously i partly blame the news which only reports content that evokes hatred and outcry half the time important information is withheld making it look like all these victims were angels sorry blm but all races will get shot if they reach for a gun i have an awesome black friend who was raised on the west side of detroit he told me a story where he dined and dashed but got busted by a off duty cop at the door the cop briefly explained why what he did was wrong and then paid for his meals he is a very large guy with a appetite my friend said that will stick with him for life but it wont get reported because it doesnt cause viewers to form opinions on fabricated information and the officer was too humble to tell anyone
UpliftingNews,removed,stories like this is what heals the shit blm bitches about
UpliftingNews,removed,million for anti bullying campaign hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahshshahahajjaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahs

UpliftingNews,removed,fuck you
UpliftingNews,removed,but youre still in rpolitics apparently get the fuck out of here
UpliftingNews,removed,its not my responsibility to help you use your web browser youre just a sociopath for liking how ignorant you are
UpliftingNews,removed,you actually are dumb like usually im talking to people who are smart but they just havent considered some piece of evidence or theyve been raised in a different environment and we can respectfully disagree or maybe they expose me to some evidence that i myself havent considered you fall into none these categories you sir are actually just plain dumb

UpliftingNews,removed,nobody cares
UpliftingNews,removed,you provided proof none you didnt have a hyphenated list you lied period your list was nebulous and non specific i tried to break off this conversation because you dont have an ideology you have a secular theology you havent actually addressed a single point i made when i destroyed your nonsense you broke off and accused me of not reading without actually addressing anything i said if this is how you behave its no wonder people act hostily towards you now kindly fuck off
UpliftingNews,removed,lol just got linked here from the main page nice to know the mods here wear their racism on their sleeve makes it easier to avoid fuck your shitty sub and your racist mods
UpliftingNews,removed,racism against whites is a consequence of identity politics that stems from the neomarxist sjw ideology you espouse if it were a reaction to historical injustices we would have seen it decades ago while you are right about said injustices blaming white people for stuff that happened when them or for most not even their parents had been born is original sin level of guilt tripping you are only making people feel under attack and react with a backlash this is one of the main reasons that got trump elected and now we are facing the very real threat of a destroyes planet our childen will have to live on perhaps it is wise to think a bit on it and take inspiration from the very article youre commenting on
UpliftingNews,removed,removing this the mod team does not condone this kind of cynicism i apologize for not acting sooner
UpliftingNews,removed,seriously that post is some real bullshit fuck that mod and his attempt at equating a silly but relevant mtv video with the fucking kkk white supremacist scum
UpliftingNews,removed,i apologize for the mess this comment thread has become the mod team does not condone this kind of behavior i removed the comment from one of our mods that was causing the problem i apologize for not acting sooner please show that we can be civil and that this sub is still a positive place to discuss positive news
UpliftingNews,removed,drugs most likely
UpliftingNews,removed,we knew about those though because we gave those wmds to iraq while setting up businesses in israel to provide parts and munitions to iran to pay for illegal operations in nicaragua we didnt go looking for those wmds we were looking for the ones that our intelligence agencies told our leaders they didnt werent making but our leaders went and told the american people they were and that they were involved in also chemical weapons from the may be viable but for less potent than new chemical weapons we also know that iraq used then on the kurds so im sure the central government had an idea and paul ryan is an idiot but not for this intentional rewriting of history and twisting of the truth
UpliftingNews,removed,one of the mods likely ibleedorange decided to sticky a post toward his own agenda
UpliftingNews,removed,so since your subreddit is now moderated by thedonald can we have it removed from defaults please
UpliftingNews,removed,is that why your post is deleted now while the one your removed got restored looks like a pretty onesided discussion there friendo
UpliftingNews,removed,god sure loves giving kids terminal disease hes a joker that one

UpliftingNews,removed,lol faggot peace
UpliftingNews,removed,no its hypocrisy that im fucking tired of in the gaming community it is textbook hipocricy youre a sjw then hope me concerned with glorious conquest than convincing them peacefully thats the difference between a warrior and an advocate they decry any social pressure on artists until its their social pressure then its fine as i said i agree focus on the action rather than insulting the person and his bar for whether something is pandering is does it include minorities you dont know that dont assume bigotry and then blame someone for that bigotry you assumed they have theyre nebulous to the point of being a boogeyman with which one can dismiss sincere opinions but ill give a point by point when i have a keyboard im on mobile porn is nebulous too it still exists i dont want a rebuttal ive been nice enough to try to explain things to you and im starting to regret that choice your help has varied from condescending to patronizing to outright insulting im trying to teach you about a problem i see with how you interact with people it would be hard not to seem condescending i think your real problem is that i dont agree with you you try to paint me as insulting you when i havent you think its an accident i never called you a name its not i have gone out of my way to treat you nicely and help you but its clear that youre unwilling to try to understand whats happening you act like you dont want people to call you an sjw it when i tried to help you see what the problem was you insult me do you want to be called an sjw continue what youre doing and dont bother responding to me if you dont seriously look back and see what i said then respond thoughtfully to what ive brought up without insulting me and we can discuss it if i see another insult towards me or anyone else im blocking and reporting
UpliftingNews,removed,lols pretty much i am in tears here happy holidays
UpliftingNews,removed,but what about the people who are not chinese what would we call them
UpliftingNews,removed,territories get their own anthems
UpliftingNews,removed,they dont want to pay taxes but they want a say
UpliftingNews,removed,well i dare say its time to rouse some rabble about this before the territories get rowdy
UpliftingNews,removed,then stop putting your hand out im a flaming liberal usually but the whole are you us or are you not us thing bugs me i say either become a state or leave the usa i would welcome puerto rico as a state and even say lets make english and spanish official languages and i would also be glad to see pr become its own fully independent nation but this trying to have the benefits of both without the responsibilities of either is too much
UpliftingNews,removed,prepare for the avalanche of comments in which americans try to make this about the usa as if we dont have enough medals
UpliftingNews,removed,puerto rico should not have a separate team they are us citizens
UpliftingNews,removed,puerto rico should play the us national anthem at the olympics until the pay off the bailout
UpliftingNews,removed,sorry not trying to take anything away from puig but what happened to serena williams
UpliftingNews,removed,itt ignorant people defending pr saying us treats them poorly so they deserve a team and ignorant people defending usa because pr citizens are us citizens so they shouldnt have a team
UpliftingNews,removed,it should be the usa receiving that medal not puerto rico theyre a territory of the usa after all im canadian btw
UpliftingNews,removed,but the star spangled banner is puerto ricos national anthem they dont and shouldnt play the maryland state anthem when michael phelps wins whats the difference
UpliftingNews,removed,did they play the reggaeton version
UpliftingNews,removed,why doesnt puerto rico just declare its sovereignty already
UpliftingNews,removed,yet these fuckers expec us to bail them out lol
UpliftingNews,removed,puerto rico is sadly the uss pet a colony they get decide everything for us pr is basically what the us was before their independence war there was a very insightful and accurate httpyoutubettmpurqhq you can check out to learn whats really happening out here
UpliftingNews,removed,puigyourfriend
UpliftingNews,removed,so thats another gold for the us
UpliftingNews,removed,its either a polite screw america or people not being horribly happy with puerto rico acting like a sovereign nation nobody wins until puerto rico grows some cojones and declares its sovereignty that is then us wins because we get to stop listening to puerto rico bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,sure why not id plug her
UpliftingNews,removed,so does the average puerto rican like their weird middleground status do they want to be a state or would they like to be an independent nation
UpliftingNews,removed,shes hot but puerto rico still sucks
UpliftingNews,removed,played the puerto rican anthem she should have her american citizenship revoked
UpliftingNews,removed,you also dont pay federal income tax so its not all that bad
UpliftingNews,removed,honestly it doesnt matter but they lean more towards the republican side because puerto ricans to a certain degree are conservatives and congress is not interested in making pr a state
UpliftingNews,removed,im not sure about that but ik crime rates and minority populations have a strong correlation the doj has all sorts of data showing those stats
UpliftingNews,removed,hopefully youll get annexed eventually then cuba can be the dream
UpliftingNews,removed,territories have anthems how is this uplifting

UpliftingNews,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
UpliftingNews,removed,yes you are in the wrong for criticizing other peoples altruistic endeavors oh is that what i asked here is what i asked am i wrong in saying that these resources could have been better spent on deserving children in povertystriken and diseaseriddled countries in the world or perhaps research into currently uncurable human afflictions in other words is the following statement false these resources could have been better spent on deserving children in povertystriken and diseaseriddled countries in the world or perhaps research into currently uncurable human afflictions homeless animals spread disease and unhampered animal populations are a potential danger to children and ecosystems so its a societal benefit to keep them housed and clean culling achieves the same effect maybe that hurts your fweelings but cleanliness does not justify television sets and sofas invest those resources into areas that will instead promote a sterile and diseasefree environment nice try shelter animals can be tested for temperament and pulled to work as service animals for our nations disabled police and veterans saving these organizations thousands in breeding costs and providing an absolutely needed support system for our war heroes needy humans and to help our policing efforts or they can be culled and we can continue producing quality service animals from reliable breedstock breeding when done properly and when properly regulated is not cruel again if culling hurts your fweelings then by all means spend the resources not on television sets and sofas but on research into canine behaviour shelters reunite people with their lost pets so while someone like you doesnt care i for one am glad that my tax money and donations would go to help return my lost pet to me shelters without television sets also fulfill the same functions at least the volunteers and donors who made this happen are doing something to make the world a better place unlike you what has my own activities got to do with the truth of what i say sure it might make me a hypocritical person but being a hypocritical person and stating a fact is by no means mutually exclusive sigh try harder i know you mean well but good vibes dont stand up to logical scrutiny

UpliftingNews,removed,its like if you take the grubby tyrants and selfserving zealots out of it that leaves like religious people
UpliftingNews,removed,plot twist they burnt it down
UpliftingNews,removed,muslims persecuted jews and christians since the start they brought the crusades on by their violent and horrible actions against those religions dont try and make them out to be noble they are a violent religion built on hate and savagery the radical portion is much larger than you imagine and the rest of them condone the actions and support horrible concepts like sharia law
UpliftingNews,removed,thats great muslims and jews have so much in common they both mutilate baby genitals they both abstain from pork they both have a feeling like the world is against them
UpliftingNews,removed,too bad theyll never pay them back whens the last time those people were giving and not taking
UpliftingNews,removed,you are trying to use colonization to justify their current barbaric behavior so bringing up the crusades is just as valid they are horrible people practicing a violent and vile religion and no amount of actions on the part of outsiders justifies their terrorist activities
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile israel approved more illegal settlements
UpliftingNews,removed,quran those who disbelieve our revelations we shall expose them to the fire as often as their skins are consumed we shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment lo allah is ever mighty wise fuck you man stop saying bullshit islam is hate at its roots i dont buy your ignorant bulshit just because you feel moderate tell that to the people who murder rape and segregate women in the name of allah like in your own country you cheat

UpliftingNews,removed,i dont see this happening in israel
UpliftingNews,removed,its muslim that wants jews dead oh and did you know that israelis are banned to enter most muslim countries
UpliftingNews,removed,and in the bible theres nowhere written that youre allowed to do that while in the qran muhamud litterally had sex with a so again whoever did that it was their decision and as such their sin while in the qran youre allowed to fuck childrens so dont give me the pedophilia bullshit because youre as ignorant as you can be about islam then
UpliftingNews,removed,yes let the people who want to murser you especially right on in gullible fools quran they but wish that ye should reject faith as they do and thus be on the same footing as they but take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of allah from what is forbidden but if they turn renegades seize them and slay them wherever ye find them and in any case take no friends or helpers from their ranks quran i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them quran and fight with them until there is no more fitna disorder unbelief and religion is all for allah quran so when the sacred months have passed away then slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate leave their way free to them quran fight against them so that allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people quran fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by allah and his messenger nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued quran o you who believe fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness quran therefore listen not to the unbelievers but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness plenty more to cite but heres the cliff note version muslims want to kill all nonbelievers and forcibly convert the world to islam and they have special hatred for jews and christians get this shit out of here nothing uplifting about this its just pathetic
UpliftingNews,removed,dont see many jews and christians ploughing into crowds of people in trucks these days it doesnt get more peaceful than that
UpliftingNews,removed,quran they but wish that ye should reject faith as they do and thus be on the same footing as they but take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of allah from what is forbidden but if they turn renegades seize them and slay them wherever ye find them and in any case take no friends or helpers from their ranks quran i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them quran and fight with them until there is no more fitna disorder unbelief and religion is all for allah quran so when the sacred months have passed away then slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poorrate leave their way free to them quran fight against them so that allah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people quran fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by allah and his messenger nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued quran o you who believe fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness quran therefore listen not to the unbelievers but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness plenty more to cite but heres the cliff note version muslims want to kill all nonbelievers and forcibly convert the world to islam and they have special hatred for jews and christians islam is not compatible with anything but islam
UpliftingNews,removed,they have consistently enforced usury on people throughout history its why theyve been kicked out of numerous countries in the past they cause debt accumulate wealth and try and subvert and corrupt sovereign nations for their own benefit the upper echelons of judaism like all religions are a network of controlling parasites who view themselves as superior beings the jewish lobby is out in force today it seems again trying to manipulate public opinion by censoring any truths that could be perceived as antisemite what a friendly and transparent people you are
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet those jew are going to build another synagogue where the mosque was and say it was always there land
UpliftingNews,removed,even in the qran its allowed to trade humans but do you think that christians practice that en mass or at all well dood sorry to break it to you but slavery still happens in mudslime countries
UpliftingNews,removed,whens the last time anyone heard of a jew suicide bomber
UpliftingNews,removed,these are quotes in the koran whether you like it or not but surely muslim is a great religion opression of women legal to rape female gender mutilation mohammed married and had sex with a year old and the koran teaches to kill nonbelievers its in the actual koran sorry if it doesnt fit your narrative
UpliftingNews,removed,true christianmuslimetc when you act as the majority do true muslims are sexists homophobes muslims who have grown up in western liberal democracies are not true muslims since the vast majority would not agree with their views
UpliftingNews,removed,religious people cant really be hope for humanity they have illogical thoughts studies proves it and everytime without exception limit freedom of non religious
UpliftingNews,removed,its nice to see a common enemy can unite people when in evil christian land jews and muslims can get along while bombing eachother daily in and around israël
UpliftingNews,removed,except the chai boy rape thingthats fairly shitty
UpliftingNews,removed,ratheism is not that when they call random people pedophiles based on their lifestyle which ironically parallels homophobic behavior they claim to have logically evolved beyond with their mighty fedoras for example i was called a pedophile on rnottheonion in response to daring to insinuate that not all atheists are perfect geniuses who wont get themselves killed by domestic terrorists it was a couple months back a post about the temple of satan acting like children yet again
UpliftingNews,removed,i would bet my life savings that the muslims would not do the same if a synagogue burned down
UpliftingNews,removed,more victims of donald trump and his vicious hate machine
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah sure but in reality muslims hate and murder jews fact
UpliftingNews,removed,if youd like your point to get across maybe try something other than a youtube video
UpliftingNews,removed,for uplifting news this place sure has a lot of assholes
UpliftingNews,removed,good job texas
UpliftingNews,removed,jews conceived nurtured and spread islamaphobia in the middleast europe and americas by owning the media and by misleading the masses ultra jews polarize the country for jews profit the elite jews the ultra rich and the controllers of the central bank rule the world by turning brother against brother this nice gesture of comman jews helping muslims is awesome but if people knew of the things the elite jews do to stab people in the back passively they would react very differently anyone who points out the truth will be labeled anti semite helping a brother is something we should appreciate but people should also be aware of the evils that an elite group is doing to the world
UpliftingNews,removed,how funny would it be if they just stole everything of value and burned it down it down lol
UpliftingNews,removed,most jews are
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah fuck america but some americans are alright
UpliftingNews,removed,that is old testament which a lot of is no longer practiced only an extremely stupid person would type something like that
UpliftingNews,removed,that video looks highly manipulative though just from the opening music
UpliftingNews,removed,amazing how no one talks about the israeli military who throws hand granades in mosques and executing muslims in palestina however to give the key is getting so much more popularity and appreciation well done jews but i hope that you fight against your fellow government and military back in israel with such a determination
UpliftingNews,removed,in other news jews displace more palestinians by demolishing their homes to make way for more of the chosen ones
UpliftingNews,removed,then theres israel
UpliftingNews,removed,anecdotal propaganda the jews hate the muslims and visa versa the difference is that the jews migrate from the problem while muslims jail or murder them
UpliftingNews,removed,so they can burn it down too
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah because when there are a significant number of muslims in the country im sure they would do the same reeeeeeee when a country gets above a certain percentage of muslims the sharia law and other bullshit starts to come out
UpliftingNews,removed,dont be a dick im not even using my own words here im merely quoting a tiny portion of islamic holy verses showing that they want to murder infidels especially jewschristians and forcibly convert the world to islam that is why there is nothing uplifting about this its just sad that they think muslims give a fuck about them
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting news
UpliftingNews,removed,thats why we cant bring them here they are our enemy
UpliftingNews,removed,yes and in the flesh practiced on true human beings while you think that only because its written somewhere it doesnt mean that anybody does it well thats my proof of its existence and that its actually a thing so i dont buy into your crap fellar and denying the evidence doesnt make you any better of any blindfolded fanatic out there
UpliftingNews,removed,there is no better way to kick the terrorism out of them than to show love and compassion when they need it the most youre in america now bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,christians arent being demonized as violent and untrustworthy are you saying libtard cucks wouldnt have cared or jews wouldnt have cared
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah all they gotta do is pay a tax
UpliftingNews,removed,c u c k s

UpliftingNews,removed,good good now give back jerusalem
UpliftingNews,removed,a place where people go to talk about their delusions burns down i dont see the big deal
UpliftingNews,removed,uh no youre not smart islam has always been the enemy of everyone its in their holy book they only want to either convert you or severe your head from your body the crusades happened because islam kept committing christian genocide over and over to this very fucking day they still do the same shit use google its so fucking easy just research something for once
UpliftingNews,removed,agreed as a muslim man living in america my hatred is fueled everyday by evil right wing americans it i just dont understand how people can be so far from humanity to deem others unfit to live and be here it is truly disgusting and i pray for them and strength for myself
UpliftingNews,removed,they definitely worship in planes and tall buildings
UpliftingNews,removed,or maybe its their book that says that world peace can only be achieved when everyone is a muslim or dead the same book that tells them to kill for islam
UpliftingNews,removed,congratulations white supremacists youve somehow gotten jews and muslims to band together i cant wait for african americans join this new minority justice league the south will collectively convulse with terror
UpliftingNews,removed,buahahahahahahaahahaahhaahahha
UpliftingNews,removed,their is a plethora of educated islamic scholars out in full force on this subreddit let me just help you guys out on what they are stating they are basically saying that the second amendment in the united states constitution lets a prison inmate who just got out from a year sentence to have the right to possess a gun they are also saying that the first amendment allows freedom of religion therefore you are allowed to murder people in the name of your religion before anybody refutes me and says that this makes no sense according to us law i can safely say that this is but a simple interpretation and anybody saying these views are unconstitutional are invoking the no true scotsman fallacy i mean it clearly says freedom of religion who cares if i interpret it to the point of insanity take it out context not understand law and then come to a conclusion based on this my conclusion is that moderate americans are not bad but anybody that follows the constitution is evil s
UpliftingNews,removed,the jewish are showing the christians how to practice the compassion that they preach
UpliftingNews,removed,prime example of the jewish lobby here friends such a pleasant people you are

UpliftingNews,removed,yes completely gone with the crazy idea i should protect my people and country from the enemy that wants to rape and kill them you dont know a single thing about this worlds history you arent fit to have a political voice because youll bring pain on all of us for what so you look tolerant thats how insane you liberals are
UpliftingNews,removed,tbf i love seeing mosques getting burnt down
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,how do you ever expect anyone to ever trust anything a muslim ever says when they teach the practice of httpsenwikipediaorgwikitaqiya your kind is taught from a young age to lie and deceive to the rest of the world the true nature of your faith you are taught to hate and kill all of you are savage monsters every last mulsim man woman and child
UpliftingNews,removed,well pal you got me in a corner here i give up youre right im going to tell my friend whose father was killed by a terrorist that his fathers killer was an isolated case and he was just unlucky and that had nothing to do with islam
UpliftingNews,removed,should we be treating the righteous as being righteous and the guilty as being guilty not blaming the righteous for the crimes of the guilty
UpliftingNews,removed,they also vote democrat some people are just suicidal cucks
UpliftingNews,removed,why dont you ask him about the celebrations after the practice of taqiya how they feel about child marriage his opinion on jews in the holy land and what he thinks about sharia law then remember that they are all taught httpsenwikipediaorgwikitaqiya and so all those nice sweet answers about a religion of peace and love is all bullshit and how they treat nonmuslims like complete shit in every single country under muslim rule they are evil savage pieces of filth yes even your coworker
UpliftingNews,removed,religious people are fairytale believing dorks and i cant wait until the degenerative disease known as aging is cured and all the religious people refuse to take the cure because they want die and go to heaven and the whole planet is left with the superior scientific beings and we can finally figure everything out without the religious slobs getting in our way and holding us back

UpliftingNews,removed,this is not uplifting this is political spin thats dangerous i thought politics where against this subs rules
UpliftingNews,removed,bad idea
UpliftingNews,removed,fuckin kikes will probably burn their own synagogue down once the mudslimes are inside fuck jews
UpliftingNews,removed,oh great now they will destroy the synagogue too 🙄
UpliftingNews,removed,pretty sure the jewish people do not worship a god that condones pedophilia and wanton murder
UpliftingNews,removed,in all honest tho muslims in a synagogue is kinda like registered pedophiles in a daycare
UpliftingNews,removed,we know we know jews always want to push muslims into majority white countries we get it already
UpliftingNews,removed,you know i come here to avoid hearing about our psychotic dictator get this trump humanamizing garbage off of uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,well they do worship the same nothing
UpliftingNews,removed,then muslims took the key threw it to the ground spat it on it and said fuck you kike
UpliftingNews,removed,holy shit you are literally autistic
UpliftingNews,removed,aaaaaaand the muslims burnt down the synagogue
UpliftingNews,removed,because op and most of western media want to think islam is like buddhism or hinduism and its not its closer to neonazis or kkk their tolerance for women rights and for homosexual rights is zero so it was a well meaning but naive gesture from the jewish synagogue take a look this video is from norway
UpliftingNews,removed,this hadith is talking about the coming of the antichrist muslims believe in the second coming of jesus as well and since jews reject him some of them will join the anti christ believing him to be the messiah and fight against jesus muslims are commanded to fight against jews specifically when this time comes not before
UpliftingNews,removed,islam is a religion of submission and intolerance it condones killing infidels who wont submit to allah
UpliftingNews,removed,generous other way round would not happen
UpliftingNews,removed,i am not a liberal i still hate this man this doesnt humanize him cause he does something perceived to be normal hes a total mess and anyone sticking up for him has got to dig deep to do so and in turn make a fool of themselves hes everything i hate about hollywood politics and millionaires all rolled into one hateful pompous lizard person
UpliftingNews,removed,kiss ass
UpliftingNews,removed,being open to learning new things and an active desire to experience new things i feel like this is a statement everyone applies to themselves with the belief that not many others do it its largely vacuous of any real meaning or analysis into modus operandi of discriminatory acts such as this i think its really clear that the way you encourage people who have an obsession with their ingroup to understand that the outgroup isnt so evil is to literally rub their nose in it via travel this isnt a practical solution or conclusion it might work in certain scenarios but it wouldnt work in this scenario travel is the last thing you want people doing when it comes to discrimination towards muslims muslim countries are fucking terrible to white people black people women christians jews and anyone not them i live in one for years while i met the most amazing people there i have also never experienced bigotry on that scale before the values that are widespread in these countries are toxic i think a better solution is to push the idea of individualism a classic liberal principle in which one person not beholden to any other collective just because egypt has of people agreeing women should be stoned for adultery doesnt mean that egyptian sitting next to you thinks that and that you should treat him as a stranger not part of the egyptian collective
UpliftingNews,removed,kisspeptin who creates these names

UpliftingNews,removed,probably should read woman with down syndrome used by family to sell cookies
UpliftingNews,removed,but lets be real why would any business hire an employee that has down syndrome might as well start hiring people just because theyre gay too then
UpliftingNews,removed,doesnt mean uplifting fakenews should be acceptable
UpliftingNews,removed,would you say these are slowcooked
UpliftingNews,removed,you just lack the insight to credit the crappy people i hope your parents are helping you get a cookie business i wish my parents would except they hardly support me and especially because one killed themselves have a nice day
UpliftingNews,removed,damn the comments on the article are ridiculously negative im not one for coddling positivity but seriously that shit is uncalled for
UpliftingNews,removed,meh just because its uplifting doesnt mean it gets a pass on being misleading
UpliftingNews,removed,thats great but lets be honest she is being successful because she has downs and she is getting pity buys her online shop has in the front page a picture of her with a text explaining her sad story im sure it was her moms idea to promote it like that on purpose its great that people are so good willed but is not like she is that super bussines expert or you cant make those cookies at home
UpliftingNews,removed,bad idea to let your wife have her claws too deeply in your business if she decides to divorce you she has a plethora of bonus knowledge to screw you
UpliftingNews,removed,do they have health inspectors checking the safety of this food it is made by retards after all lol
UpliftingNews,removed,she should call her business down for some cookies im not sure how these types of jokes fly in the community i guess it depends where its coming from like on that glee show when the girl says my mom says i have get down syndrome is it one of those things where its ok to laugh if you have it i really just like puns i cant help myself
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah we should hire retards to be surgeons and airline pilots
UpliftingNews,removed,and then you visit the comment section
UpliftingNews,removed,i have downs and im a air traffic controller no wait that is not true i just sit around drooling on myself

UpliftingNews,removed,now instead of being totally covered im just mostly covered yay such a mental culture
UpliftingNews,removed,it is a vast minority even however their culture can still be harsh to women even when dealing with just regular non extremists
UpliftingNews,removed,today on uplifting news women who are oppressed by isis to wear full body cover fought back and are now slightly less oppressed
UpliftingNews,removed,the quran states it the head of the religion was a warlord and pedophile there can not be peace from evil islam is not a peaceful ideology and not compatible with the modern world
UpliftingNews,removed,uwalstibs is a little ray of truth you have no rights in islam i would recommend looking at the rexmuslim sub for deeper knowledge of supposedly peaceful religion
UpliftingNews,removed,actually yes
UpliftingNews,removed,well theyre dead now
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet her vagina would taste spicy
UpliftingNews,removed,good

UpliftingNews,removed,from the article the couple has been married for years but were placed in separate nursing homes the title couple that has been married for years but was placed in separate nursing homes neither of the above sound correct couple that have but were placed sounds better to me
UpliftingNews,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit couple that has been married for years but was placed in separate nursing homes for the better part of a year due to a backlog in the health care system have finally been footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot

UpliftingNews,removed,i hope whoever is responsible for that happening gets their head cut off
UpliftingNews,removed,whats the deal with airplane food
UpliftingNews,removed,saving for later when people complain about the usas healthcare
UpliftingNews,removed,this wouldnt happen in americas healthcare system
UpliftingNews,removed,this is what happens when a country provides universal health care
UpliftingNews,removed,be me homeless guy americaisgreatjpeg living on streets for many years cant find a job so i cant find a house cant find a house so i cant find women see fat entitled pieces of shit waste food and money like its nothing while hanging out with their pretty girlfriends i starve and and struggle to just live another day start to grow resentful ideabot start to concoct a plan to get back at society they will all suffer for their crimes go to library look up bombs and bomb making materials begin to collect pieces and parts i need through junk yards shoplifting and buying what i need with my panhandling money its all starting to come together day of reckoning comes its finally ready going to take myself out along with all these other ungrateful slobs prepare myself for the sweet release hello darkness my old friend but i cant do it i chicken out defeated and degraded more than usual i turn myself in to the police showing them where the bomb is mfw they blame it on terrorism mfw im now a hero mfw they give me a place to live and a job god bless america
UpliftingNews,removed,its a shame vulnerable people in the land of the free only get help like this on the back of stopping a bomb and proving themselves as opposed to just getting it because theyre a person like everyone else and dont deserve to be on the streets
UpliftingNews,removed,terrorism works
UpliftingNews,removed,shhh dont interrupt the circle of rahrah
UpliftingNews,removed,we dont care about people until they provide us something useful it is sad
UpliftingNews,removed,at that instant the homeless bomb hunter squad was born
UpliftingNews,removed,conversely its really depressing that this individual who probably has always had this capacity to do good was only given these opportunities for doing something heroic
UpliftingNews,removed,well theres a perverse incentive for ya
UpliftingNews,removed,we should plant bombs all over the city so homeless people can find them and get jobs
UpliftingNews,removed,this is good rewarding the homeless people when they do good deeds sets a good example to other homeless people and encourage them to start contributing to society
UpliftingNews,removed,great now lets do it with the rest of the homeless that would lead to a dysfunctional society because it would provide incentives for being homeless there are many people with homes that cant find work people working long hours just to provide what youre proposing be given away for free
UpliftingNews,removed,being coined a hero for stealing a backpack hes a fucking thief i mean yeah thank god he stole it and no one died but how does that this get mentioned at all he accidentally saved lives by being a criminal deserves no recognition sorry
UpliftingNews,removed,why in america cant you sort the massive homeless problem out with out people needing to find bombs to get shelter whenever i visit the usa from europe i find it shocking how many homeless and people with mental health people are just discarded on the streets
UpliftingNews,removed,so this person had to find a bomb to be helped by the community
UpliftingNews,removed,the guy stole the backpack it wasnt until later that he looked in to find it was a bomb great that it worked out the way it did but the guy still stole the backpack
UpliftingNews,removed,the problem with combatting homelessness is that there are many homeless people who simply do not want to work
UpliftingNews,removed,right if we had all that to give one guy why cant we do it for more i mean im not knocking the dude but all he did was find a bomb that doesnt show any kind of merit my point is that we have the capacity to help those in need and we choose not to and only when it will make a splash in the media
UpliftingNews,removed,props the thing that makes this news story pretty dark however is that these bombs were in fact planted by the government in a ploy to divert attention from last weeks accidental lasted over an hour attacks on socalled friendly troops the state army in syria open your eyes people
UpliftingNews,removed,i find it interesting that this man is genuinely in need and displayed real heroism and got almost from crowd funding meanwhile sjw feminists are raising hundreds of thousands on bs causes while in their apple airbook or whatever and sipping a fn latte
UpliftingNews,removed,what a good dude eh stole a full backpack from the top of a trashcan and hes a hero come on
UpliftingNews,removed,lmao yeah real heroes if the backpack didnt have a bomb in it this story would have been about a backpack theft they did do the right thing by reporting it but their original intention was to steal the backpack once a thief always a thief
UpliftingNews,removed,lol so when he and a friend came across a new backpack sitting atop a garbage can next to the elizabeth new jersey train station last sunday night it was like divine providence he picked it up and they walked a bit it was only when he looked inside that he saw a maze of wires hooked up to makeshift pipe bombs the guy was just trying to steal it he only went to the police when he went to look what goodies he was gonna get this is a once in a lifetime thing that happened and everyone here is acting like all of our homeless people are great people just down on their luck there are lots of homeless people where i work and i can tell you most of them are drug users and criminals
UpliftingNews,removed,lots of little actions of others contribute to a better world or a not so better world take me for example i am a miserable person due to how i reacted to a great loss in my life on reddit this equates to being a troll maybe most people see a troll coming a mile away and dont even let anything they say in but once in a while i can feel the anger or sadness i evoke in some
UpliftingNews,removed,i hate these kinds of stories it perpetuates the idea that if you are in need you need to win some sort of lottery to have your basic needs met we should be taking care of our fellow citizens
UpliftingNews,removed,no one cared who i was until i found the bomb
UpliftingNews,removed,terrorists should place more bombs near homeless then theyd be doing the world a favour
UpliftingNews,removed,as a bomb sniffing dog
UpliftingNews,removed,homeless man who saved worthless beings aka humans is now forced into slavery with the excuse of a happy life after working for years like any slave did thousands of years ago there you go i fixed it up to make it accurate
UpliftingNews,removed,relaxx
UpliftingNews,removed,i find this story to be pretty depressing actually humans suck we should be endangered instead the planet would be better off
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont see how churches having new kids to brainwash is uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,little known fact the elephant can use his tusk to repel enemy poacher some say this creature is a gift from god
UpliftingNews,removed,cant believe that photo and the article isnt about the rnc
UpliftingNews,removed,i know this is pretty fucked up but we should really encourage people to hunt poachers im honestly quite surprised poacher hunting hasnt been a bigger thing in the western world its literally a perfectly legal way to kill somebody and lots of people will hold you in high esteem for doing it
UpliftingNews,removed,this looks like some wierd bdsm beastiality
UpliftingNews,removed,the localized human overpopulation crisis that is destroyin the elephants habitat could be addressed with contraception to the great relief of all the men and women having more kids than they want or can provide for but something something jesus babies
UpliftingNews,removed,they relocated africa
UpliftingNews,removed,so they moved a bunch of fat women around in africa
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,all because some asshole decided to use this sweet thing to protect his drugs hopefully that twat is still on death row
UpliftingNews,removed,thats the uk for you just an insane nanny state
UpliftingNews,removed,rimgoingtohellforthis
UpliftingNews,removed,wtf is wrong with the uk government its a dog not fucking satan himself offering granny one last good dicking before he takes her soul to hell
UpliftingNews,removed,trying to understand why this dog is on death row then i read stella was seized by police in a raid in torquay in may in which they also found a cannabisgrowing operation so torture then murder because she was being cared for by someone who was growing some plants god is not impressed you stupid fucking humans
UpliftingNews,removed,sort of related question why do we say that certain races of dogs can be more aggressive or dangerous than others but we say that all human races must be equal and cannot be different even though we different races have different attributes
UpliftingNews,removed,not sure how this is uplifting news the judge was right the most humane thing to do for society and the dog would be to euthanize it
UpliftingNews,removed,i used to volunteer in my old town but in my new city all the shelters want you to commit to a schedule for sorry thanks but no thanks i cant commit to that if theyre lacking for volunteers i dont know if they are thats their problem
UpliftingNews,removed,bro the dog grew up on a mary jew anah farm clearly it is satan himself
UpliftingNews,removed,excuse me i might drink a little more than i should tonight
UpliftingNews,removed,op starred in a documentary called wilfred a while back fascinating story
UpliftingNews,removed,thats how millions of farm animals live every day
UpliftingNews,removed,if any of you think this is inhumane but still eat meat from factory farms you are delusional
UpliftingNews,removed,yea cause we need more fucking lame ass churches in the south fuck cults
UpliftingNews,removed,so dogs are considered concious enough to be held accountable for their actions and go to death row but still not enough to punish animal abusers accordingly
UpliftingNews,removed,that fucking judge and the cops who put him in there with no exercise heartless bastards always blaming the animal for misbehavior and would rather get rid of it rather than rehabilitating it sad day for humanity
UpliftingNews,removed,that dog looks fucking psycho
UpliftingNews,removed,✾
UpliftingNews,removed,a little bit oedipus
UpliftingNews,removed,youre just saying that i wouldnt bang them
UpliftingNews,removed,would you still be a sick bastard for trying to sleep with one of the flower girls

UpliftingNews,removed,granny on my left got some tig ol bitties
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,fucking hell
UpliftingNews,removed,that sounds quite appropriate so that you can walk and drop things on the right
UpliftingNews,removed,everyone on reddit has baller jobs apparently data scientist sounds pretty fancy forna faggot millennial
UpliftingNews,removed,btw bro i kill niggers fo free basically a special forces bounty hunter thats my job not a made up one like data scientist
UpliftingNews,removed,youre a sjw then youre more concerned with glorious conquest than convincing them peacefully thats the difference between a warrior and an advocate and youre an asshole no better than me but preferring to defend bigots than their victims dont assume bigotry and then blame someone for that bigotry you assumed they have that was literally their check for pandering ive been nice enough to try to explain things to you and im starting to regret that choice you havent been nice youve been a jackass with handwringing paragraphs im trying to teach you about a problem i see with how you interact with people youre doing a terrible job you think its an accident i never called you a name you literally just called me an sjw you stupid asshole you act like you dont want people to call you an sjw it when i tried to help you see what the problem was you insult me you didnt try to help you tried to justify it
UpliftingNews,removed,france is not french anymore the islamists will destroy that road in less than a year

UpliftingNews,removed,giving jobs to disable person good idea but its not really that you see do you know this
UpliftingNews,removed,want superbugs at a hospital allow the disabled into the building its common sense im not saying we shouldnt treat or feed the disabled but do it in facilities that cater to their needs
UpliftingNews,removed,im not sure if this is a good thing
UpliftingNews,removed,thats racist against the non disabled race of people
UpliftingNews,removed,because we need more evil islamic terrorists leading european countries
UpliftingNews,removed,good for you i experimented in dating one once at first it was smiley and kind and those wheels were cute in a way but once you get down a layer or two oh boy it was absolutely crawling with bacteria i had to learn the truth the hard way listen to me son ive been to nam and back you want nothing to do with nam colors and smells that shouldnt exist are you listening to me boy ive seen some things

UpliftingNews,removed,link
UpliftingNews,removed,i used to push bike to intermediate school every day from the age of on my ride to school there was always two high school kids atleast a few years older who would throw lemons at me from across the street most of the time they would miss but it was always very frightening for me at the time and they always came prepared waiting for me there is nothing worse than cowardess bullies if i ever came across a similar situation where i saw bullying like this i wouldnt hesitate to instill fear in the bullies so they know what it feels like to be vulnerable
UpliftingNews,removed,ones preggers shocking
UpliftingNews,removed,psa as uplifting as this might be please note that breitbart is an altright white nationalist tabloid that operated as trumps mouthpiece during the campaign until october last year the company was run by steve bannon trumps current chief strategist and right hand man as such breitbart is now effectively a stateoperated propaganda site during the transition toward trumpism breitbarts senior staff were caught in numerous controversies including professional cannibalism of one of their own staff assaulted by trumps campaign manager cory lewandowski they are an abhorrent organization with absolutely zero journalistic credibility do not trust them do not link them but if you do do not expect us to upvote them
UpliftingNews,removed,wait what theyre trying to harbor terrorists why
UpliftingNews,removed,whats that minutes of revenue woopty fucking doo
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting news small million from a multi billion company with basically endless resources they keep throwing on bling like google glass well at least they get some publicity from it the money might suffice for some to blow up part of the ameritards wall
UpliftingNews,removed,those million dollars would go a lot further if they were used in the countries people flee from which is every country that is not in europe at the moment
UpliftingNews,removed,what a shame they didnt do this for the hundreds of thousands of people obama killed with bombs over the last years worlds gone mad
UpliftingNews,removed,all these people tossing around money and we still got homeless americans and vets that cant get medical help this world is crazy
UpliftingNews,removed,what about the thousands of homeless and starving children right here in the united states
UpliftingNews,removed,lets be honest thats the taxes they alreay owe for that they wont pay
UpliftingNews,removed,how about if they donate that same amount to disabled vets or perhaps habitat for humanity homeless relief maybe how about taking care of your own first
UpliftingNews,removed,why the fuck cant google create a dollar crisis fund for flint michigan
UpliftingNews,removed,what is this a thread not circle jerking over how the world is going to end over a short suspension to the refugee system is this even reddit
UpliftingNews,removed,if only google put as much money in to paying their taxes
UpliftingNews,removed,so is everyone going to ignore the tens maybe hundreds of billions of dollars that google has avoided paying in tax just because they give away four million dollars
UpliftingNews,removed,you need to stop spamming this thread your point is well taken please stop
UpliftingNews,removed,what exactly makes american homeless more important than other people in dire situations fuck you if you think that nobody should be helped except your people
UpliftingNews,removed,in comparison thats probally for normal individuals
UpliftingNews,removed,the gun violence in chicago is massively overstated by the media i never realized how massive of an area they consider to be the city of chicago until i actually moved here the actual downtown area and northern part of the city is very safe the unsafe areas are the southern part of the city and most of the gun violence that you see reported by the media is gang related violence im not saying the violence doesnt happen but i wouldnt be more nervous walking around in chicago than new york city la or any other big city
UpliftingNews,removed,its too bad all this money is being raise for nonamericans all while americans in flint still have poisoned water what a shame
UpliftingNews,removed,go ahead report me for telling the truth i dont even know what sub i am on that is how little i give a shit about internet points lmao you made me feel like a kid again where someone told on me ahahahahahaha thanks for being the anal rule following ignorant sheep that you are i guess
UpliftingNews,removed,here you see an example of a government that fails to serve the people it promised to help now the people turn to self government in the face of a failed system by there will be a decentralization revolution power to the people and down with the banks
UpliftingNews,removed,man has grandkids no one to go fishing with wtf
UpliftingNews,removed,obama didnt do this for the hundreds of thousands of homeless and vets that cant get medical help

UpliftingNews,removed,isnt this like years agos internet crises we cared about it for its minutes
UpliftingNews,removed,that pussy has got to be like a windsock by now
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe they made friends with the schoolboys that were kidnapped shortly prior im sure those will be returning as well any day now
UpliftingNews,removed,how is this uplifting theyve been reunited with their equally insane families theyre all repeat rape victims and no doubt will be completely trashed by their community the only thing that could possibly be uplifting coming out of this story is if every member of boko haram were killed slowly with cheese graters
UpliftingNews,removed,bbc nice try
UpliftingNews,removed,this is islam
UpliftingNews,removed,women always over men in conflicts rape of nanking they call it women raped chinese men executed should be the massacre of nanking
UpliftingNews,removed,ugh thank god isnt the fight over which god is the real god what got all of them in this mess in the first place
UpliftingNews,removed,islam has plenty to do with it take for example this dr abd alaziz fawazan alfawzan a professor of islamic law said that if a woman gets raped walking in public alone then she herself is at fault she is only seducing men by her presence she should have stayed at home like a muslim woman in many cases islam teaches that in most but not all cases a woman is at fault for adultry if she is raped by western standards it wouldnt be called raped by islamic standards of course there are muslims who defy islamic teachings like there are muslims that drink alcohol but if you look at what islam teaches then yes in most cases the woman is at fault for being raped
UpliftingNews,removed,just pointing out a fact youre a unionist rat cunt an absolute disgrace imagine such a small minded bitter little cunt that youd rather let another country and in particular the the tory government rule over us rather than allow scotland to have its own democracy fucking cunt

UpliftingNews,removed,my high school was fucking difficultbut it was a private catholic all boys school graduated in
UpliftingNews,removed,jesus youre fucking retarded the average sociology student isnt going to get a phd so the average iq of one doesnt matter not that iq is at all applicable here
UpliftingNews,removed,you should know that the majority of college athletics have an overall gpa of you might want to go complain about college athletics somewhere else
UpliftingNews,removed,you could drool all over your desk in high school and still get a c we arent smarter we are lowering our standards
UpliftingNews,removed,thats good he deserves everything he shouldnt have broken the law in the first place
UpliftingNews,removed,although those are interesting point you have to consider the location nuclear power plants need several requirements to be met in order to work efficiently and safely you also need to be close enough to somewhere that needs the power otherwise you just wasted a whole lotta on something that wont be used solar on the other hand can be put just about anywhere under the sun and you can set them up in rural areas that dont use much power unlike nuclear plantswhich you could set up if you really wanted too but it would be a big waste
UpliftingNews,removed,dude skhreli upped the price for insurance companies he is willing to give it out for free to people without insurance just give him a call
UpliftingNews,removed,reading the article damn these kids are smart how did a bunch of aussie teenagers pull this off scroll down and see picture asian asian asian white dudethat explains it
UpliftingNews,removed,someone calls shkreli a doo doo bad man because he literally wants people affected with aids to die he raised the price to damage insurance companies not the patients iirc people who need daraprim still receive it its just the insurance companies that took the hit american media outlets started insulting shkreli because they are in some way funded by insurance money too at least thats my opinion

UpliftingNews,removed,its this kind of stuff that really pisses me off as a pharmacist im a b pharm graduate just out of college and it drives me crazy when people pull up stats like this without knowing what it takes to actually run a full scale pharmaceutical manufacturing site yes it cost them to create in a lab but wholesale production is a huge process and has insane costs let me give you just a basic picturethis is my experience with regards to pharma companies in indiait might differ slightly according to usfda or mhra guidelines cgmp every pharmaceutical plant has to have cgmp compliance and are regularly audited for this includes facility utilities personnel etc and these are norms not followed in almost any other industry it takes a shit ton of money to make sure that all our manufacturing is being carried out in the best condition possible ever tried getting a pharma plant licence see how hard that is and get back to me everything from location to surface area to the fucking coving and flooring done in the production area comes under gmp criterion and this shit is no joke a small issue noticed by an fda auditor is more than enough to be withheld a licence personnel the amount of people you require to run a full scale plant is really huge and these are all people who are graduates from professional courses who have passed out from good colleges demanding a pretty decent salary despite increased automation in plants there is still a lot of human element involved everybody fumes about medicines costing a lot but nobody gives a fucking shit about the amount of pay required to maintain a highly skilled and technically oriented workforce regulatory work the amount of resources it takes to comply to regulations is so left out its downright stupid govt regulations change on the whims and fancy of the regulators themselves and its a pain the ass to fucking jump through their hoops every time artwork packing material applications employee certifications etc etc we have an entire fucking dept just catering to this shit and it isnt cheap lemme give you guys an example our local fda had an issue with one of our products artwork we scrapped our artwork kept the batches on hold created new ones with agreement from the fda and placed order for the same fast forward a bit later a new director enters the fda doesnt agree with the previous ones decision and makes us scrap all our new packing material again creating almost a crore losswhich is a big deal to a smaller domestic plant like ours miscellaneous stuff required to run the company logistics supply chain marketing operations human resources quality controlassurance engineering administration all these depts require funding and personnel to keep the plant running and alive basically these things cost money not just running them but to pay the people running them i work in quality and lemme tell you quality in pharma isnt a joke not only is it very strictly regulated but its an integral part of our manufacturing process we have some of the highest quality protocols and regulations in any industry some of the shit required to make medicines is insane even the most basic shit like building a room is a huge process cleanrooms of class and above critical entry exit procedures change controls impact assessment risk analysis qualification of the said room cleaning micro testing etc even moving a damn machine requires a change request put in place and an entire impact assessmentrisk analysis is carried out the problem with people of the fucking internet is that they see someone make a shitty ass rocket in their backyard and then ask why boeing doesnt make commercial jetliners that are that cheap

UpliftingNews,removed,i mean there was temptation ill be honest with you but me being a christian i couldnt i wanted to make sure i sleep good so thats what i did i returned the money and the wallet ah yes
UpliftingNews,removed,does your work reimburse you most uberlyfts i take are at least and while possibly over time thats the amount it costs for me to drive my car to work daily given wear and tear its in my face really like in gas daily
UpliftingNews,removed,damn blms not gonna like this guy one bit
UpliftingNews,removed,itll be ruined by a black person
UpliftingNews,removed,it truly does help those who are trying to get back on their feet while the lazy get lazier knowing that have a free meal coming their way
UpliftingNews,removed,ugh the allcaps on free makes this feel very clickbaity
UpliftingNews,removed,as an austin resident i think this will just help increase the lazy homeless population that is out of control
UpliftingNews,removed,this is impossible all muslims are evil and dont believe in reading books that upended their intelligence of western civilization thinking s joking you twats
UpliftingNews,removed,so much for it being a secret thanks obama
UpliftingNews,removed,does that expression really apply if you dont waste your food and you store it away to eat later then later when you need some food you wont want for it because its there where you stored it
UpliftingNews,removed,ah austin the liberal shithole of texas sadly i live here
UpliftingNews,removed,now that its not a secret im sure america will accidentally bomb it
UpliftingNews,removed,no i get that i just dont think its perfectly apt obviously you think im wrong and think that it does matter a lot and youre probably right youre getting worked up over it a bit you are right though that it doesnt matter and its not worth getting worked up about it i know how i feel about the expression being applied here and i can see that my posts are upsetting you to the point of cursing and snapping at people so ill stop replying to this thread out of respect for how it makes you feel
UpliftingNews,removed,how did nobody notice you having a shower also it sounds like a shitty thing to do but i guess you didnt have much choice
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet feminists hate this app because they hate the idea of a homeless white man having a decent meal
UpliftingNews,removed,shhh dont tell hillary shell drone strike it
UpliftingNews,removed,i thought you cant do stuff like this because if that person gets sick when consuming unwanted good they can sue
UpliftingNews,removed,its an invasion of someones personal space to use their facilities like that without asking from the sounds of it it wasnt a close friend because he could have just asked them youd be pissed off if an acquaintance came into your home for a drink and just decided to go have a shower being homeless and having to do rude things doesnt make those things any less rude
UpliftingNews,removed,i cant wait to hear how texass backward ass dumb ass assin ass is going to put a stop to this somehow
UpliftingNews,removed,capitalism is evil
UpliftingNews,removed,there are occupied territories and there is an israel in whose opinion yours many palestinians and more generally arabsmuslims do not agree all israel has to do is to stop occupying the occupied territories since a great many palestinian extremists believe that all of israel is illegitimate and should not exist or at least should not exist where it is now that would not stop terrorist attacks at all if this conflict were dominated by moderates instead of radicals it would have ended decades ago
UpliftingNews,removed,this will probably be made illegal by some assholes in power though
UpliftingNews,removed,in fact its the most popular myth httpwwwunsungorgfaq
UpliftingNews,removed,eta to some asshole congressman passing a law against this because dangerlazy
UpliftingNews,removed,so happy to be apart of this program its a win win for everyone involved
UpliftingNews,removed,meh
UpliftingNews,removed,my horriblenameboner is fully engorged
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,quick harvest it for whatever medicinal purposes its believed to hold
UpliftingNews,removed,until they round it up for their annual dolphin killing extravaganza and bludgeon it to death
UpliftingNews,removed,how long before they kill it and turn it into a antiaging pill or libido pills
UpliftingNews,removed,china finless porwhich soup is now a mandatory daily delicacy
UpliftingNews,removed,its even got little chinese eyes
UpliftingNews,removed,fuck you dolphin
UpliftingNews,removed,the japanese will kill them cause of you know that the dolphins dropped the abomb on them
UpliftingNews,removed,given that china is almost single handedly keeping the poaching business alive thanks to their anti scientific beliefs that these things have magical propertieswell that isnt even a little racist is it thats just a statement of facts
UpliftingNews,removed,you believe wrong even here in america my chinese friends dad refuses to go to a real doctor instead relying on bogus herbal treatments made from everything from dried up bones to common herbs and roots
UpliftingNews,removed,only a matter of time before a little limped dicked rich asian dude pays someone to get its snout or something
UpliftingNews,removed,should we i mean i dont know how it works in the rural areas but ive been to dong guan and frankly theyre fucked
UpliftingNews,removed,dont tell japan

UpliftingNews,removed,time for runch
UpliftingNews,removed,china yeah you can get that on the menu
UpliftingNews,removed,probably cause youre chinese and youre insulted by what i said i dont give a shit till china stops all that dog abusing bear torturing animal cruelty we gone hate on them
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah okay jimmy yang
UpliftingNews,removed,enough to keep rhino poaching alive and well like are you being real right now hello there are still plenty of poachers making a living by killing off animals to extinction to provide idiot chinese people with too much money their rare dick hardeners and other such nonsense shark fins hello is anything in that head of yours
UpliftingNews,removed,it even looks asian d
UpliftingNews,removed,just what i needed to cheer me up glad i can always count on this sub the mental image of a lone river dolphin horribly disfigured and miscolored by corrosive chemicals covered in tumorous lumps because of the carcinogenic sludge on the river bottom endlessly calling for its dead mate sick with loss and grief going crazy from the noise pollution caused by human activity on the river and construction on the river banks
UpliftingNews,removed,dont worry guys japan will send a special team to fuck it to death
UpliftingNews,removed,im not racist i love other asian countries its just too bad chinese middle class is so fucking disgustingly infatuated with status symbols with their new found wealth
UpliftingNews,removed,dont show the chinese
UpliftingNews,removed,time for them to eat it again
UpliftingNews,removed,cant wait for them to be hunted out to extinction again for their fins
UpliftingNews,removed,dont tell the japanese

UpliftingNews,removed,people why the down vote my comment can be meant in so many ways
UpliftingNews,removed,thread
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah that sort of pissed me off god didnt do a fucking thing the person who generously donated their money helped
UpliftingNews,removed,he then contracted zika upon arriving
UpliftingNews,removed,best news ive heard since trump
UpliftingNews,removed,come on man not everyones an atheist im sure he was thankful to the anonymous donor too
UpliftingNews,removed,no for the love of god brazil can barley handle the athletes
UpliftingNews,removed,what
UpliftingNews,removed,if you are a real smart uber driver and you want to make extra bucks just tell someone a bullshit story for example your son is going to the olympics but you cant afford to go see him or you are trying to raise money for a hospital in ethiopia or some shit like that you never know who you will pick up but you will most likely never see them again and those that do pick you up on your story just go along with it worst case scenario free ticket to the olympitcs etc
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean passenger raises thousands to send uber driver to brazil to get zika
UpliftingNews,removed,a kind and generous person donated xxxx thanks and thank you world for your kindness nope sorry not the least bit difficult again i would like to emphasize that i dont want to trash this guy he was probably just overwhelmed and i am super glad hes going still for the rest of us a bit of a lesson can be learned here however slight
UpliftingNews,removed,then he gets murdered
UpliftingNews,removed,yo somebody just donated to my go fund me i was almost moved to tears god is so good no the person that donated is good god had nothing to do with it
UpliftingNews,removed,god is so good ffs its people
UpliftingNews,removed,hopefully he wont get raped robbed and killed in the streets for their efforts
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope he dies
UpliftingNews,removed,theyll both probably die there
UpliftingNews,removed,cucks
UpliftingNews,removed,people have donated money to me who should i thank god
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet thats not the only thing she raised

UpliftingNews,removed,i hope this is not just a part of a bigger plan of that kid
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this stickied
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,i like how at the en everyone probably starts clapping drop the cage and then the cage drops under the water drowning the leopard
UpliftingNews,removed,and the leopard was killed and skinned to pay for the rescue efforts
UpliftingNews,removed,is anyone else suspicious why they have a giant open well is so these foreign wildlife charities will pay the locals to rescue animals who fall in the article itself states it is a common occurrence and you can imagine this would be an easy fix putting some sort of cover on top
UpliftingNews,removed,this is a perfect representation of india a chaotic group of people screaming and several bystanders just staring
UpliftingNews,removed,can muslims handle shellfish or is that just a jew thing
UpliftingNews,removed,i didnt know being an arabic miller was a dutch job s
UpliftingNews,removed,lol youre a hapadouche that explains the butthurt im ashamed i almost took you seriously
UpliftingNews,removed,cool how is the average male refugee doing
UpliftingNews,removed,so one guy got a job
UpliftingNews,removed,why do these jihads get to live there id rather live in the netherlands than the us
UpliftingNews,removed,the bones of all the beautiful white european women he spends his free time raping and murdering
UpliftingNews,removed,its reassuring to see some of them having different dreams from raping and mugging women in groups of
UpliftingNews,removed,more allah ackmill now
UpliftingNews,removed,he originally thought the job was asking for a killer then he just stuck with it
UpliftingNews,removed,and one jobless dutchman haha great fucking moronic europeans will get what they deserve when the entire white race is extinguished
UpliftingNews,removed,hopefully he will go back to syria and become a miller there the netherlands does not need any arabs its such a tiny tiny country that is becoming crowded it should be only for europeans
UpliftingNews,removed,its racist to protect europeans from foreign invasion fuck off antiwhite racist
UpliftingNews,removed,someone who risked their life to find a better living elsewhere if you risk your life by leaving syria then you are doing it wrong there is zero reason for any arab to come to north western europe he had to travel across thousands of kilometers of safe territory he would have been safe in any other middle eastern country that is only a short drive away the netherlands is a tiny country that is becoming overcrowded it really should only be for europeans mass migration is just colonisation and invasion its so sad that you are dumb enough to think that these people need to come to europe
UpliftingNews,removed,the difference between a dutch person and a brit is only culture such as merkel coming from a polish family but are now identical to an ethnic german but i would be willing to say that the netherlands should only be for germanic people which are english people too at most other european the difference between a dutch person and an arab person is physical their origins are completely different and the culture is wildly different too its all too different an arab who speaks dutch and likes windmills is still an arab and him and his descendants will never be dutch how are they better than noneuropeans i just dont get this kind of logic the reason you dont understand is because you think its all about superiority its not it has nothing to do with being better or worse it has nothing to do with skill smarts strength superiority or inferiority it has to do with the taxonomy of humans the anthropology of all the worlds people it has to do with europeanness its about belonging a mentally retarded swede is more deserving of eu resources than an educated arab
UpliftingNews,removed,uplifting news is a weird mix of nativity and obtuseness this isnt uplifting news because it doesnt matter we are likely already past the point of irreversible climate change we will almost certainly see a mass extinction event in the coming decades no matter how many small villages that likely had a small carbon footprint anyway change china and india are going to keep plugging along i can no longer suffer this nonsense this subreddit is ridiculous im out
UpliftingNews,removed,so bold to actually give people the holiday off
UpliftingNews,removed,lmao bold stand fuck off
UpliftingNews,removed,thats lovely maybe one day all the afghani kids with multiple amputations will also have a chance at realising their dreams
UpliftingNews,removed,dude i missed christmas and thanksgiving for the past three years because i work at a hospital ever understood people bitching about having to work on black friday boo hoo people are working everywhere at all times you have one holiday that you need to work
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope when im old and grey ill tell my ungrateful grandchildren about how people used to be forced to go into work on holidays so fat gluttonous and greedy people couldnt be bothered to plan ahead or so they could save on goods that were marked up before black friday
UpliftingNews,removed,ive never in my life shopped at in the morning on black friday just to pick up a tv for half off why because the thought of taking someone away from their family was absurd to me and still continues to be american consumers and corporations are the most inconsiderate assholes who view retail workers as a group of soulless robots this trend needs to die and the consumers need to get their heads out of their asses to end this perpetuating cycle of selfishness
UpliftingNews,removed,blackfridaydoesntmatter
UpliftingNews,removed,retail workers are free to whine about working holidays to any nurse firefighter police officer military personnel etc to their face any time
UpliftingNews,removed,translation holiday retail sales have been on the decline for years and wed rather get some good pr than pay a bunch of people for another mediocre turnout
UpliftingNews,removed,itt cry babies who cant get a better job
UpliftingNews,removed,why do you want stuff in the first place
UpliftingNews,removed,this is bullshit they are closing the movie theater and some other mall owned attractions the stores will still be open
UpliftingNews,removed,if i could throw my money at them i would that is a fantastic position to take and i hope that many more follow black friday is a stain on this country just in the way that people act to save a penny on items they really dont need
UpliftingNews,removed,minnesota vikings still suck though
UpliftingNews,removed,family values are for pussies its do or die
UpliftingNews,removed,this is awesome of course what idiot still drives to the mall to shop now if amazon closes thats something
UpliftingNews,removed,you took a bold stand with those fucked up capitalizations in the title
UpliftingNews,removed,all im saying is ive had to work hours on multiple holidays for the past few years all i hear about is a retail employees bitching about the one day of the year that they have to work thats a holiday just one
UpliftingNews,removed,rhailcorporate
UpliftingNews,removed,i agree wholeheartedly these libtards crooked hilary loving masses dont know the truth
UpliftingNews,removed,lame board
UpliftingNews,removed,great work moa now we have more people celebrating the ultimate betrayal of the natives of this great land go home and stuff your pie whole because some of our ancestors almost killed an entire nation via disease or waryays
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,the price inventory is absolutely based on stock hence the timetested concept of supply and demand but the price of inventory on thanksgiving is something different its a carrot to lure in the donkeys or the asses if you will
UpliftingNews,removed,why does anyone think the evil corporate stores will close since they were given the choice all this does is give give the mall free publicity while doing absolutely nothing for store employees what about security phaw this is a straw act by a struggling mall that doesnt change a thing
UpliftingNews,removed,thats not being a dick he must have thrown a fit because hes responsible for the revenues and it would be stated in the contract from the beginning if they want to do this that is why mall of america is allowing the shops to stay open if they choose if they insisted everyone close you can be assured that the mall would be out of business from lawsuits you have to remember its a contract and an agreement you cant break these things based on how you feel today or how you think people should get a break from work hm is quite capable of knowing their number and their business and the amount that is sold on the day what if its a big percentage like percent of the month i can call you a dick then for shutting it down and possibly getting some one fired from work as well right im not being rude im just trying to show you that you have to consider different factors with these things and not just your emotions
UpliftingNews,removed,i just assumed everyone was boycotting companies that pull that kind of nonsense if that were true they wouldnt still be in business dumbass
UpliftingNews,removed,well your a dumb ass for letting them bend you over like that tbh
UpliftingNews,removed,overmoderation the downvote button exists for a reason
UpliftingNews,removed,does my comment non fit into the koolaid culture
UpliftingNews,removed,amazon will explode
UpliftingNews,removed,its too bad the sub fails miserably at that days
UpliftingNews,removed,hey dumbass are you sure the circumstances were out of her control do you know this person irl what if she chose happiness instead of a financial secure shitty marriage if this is true it would be an example of a life choice to be poor and happy than financially secure and miserable
UpliftingNews,removed,thank you i know
UpliftingNews,removed,dawwww muhsafespace
UpliftingNews,removed,if they have the best deal im going to buy from them i dont give even a little bit of a shit what you think about it
UpliftingNews,removed,it is not a normal part of human development to be a spoiled ungrateful little shit maybe you were raised into that retarded way of thinking
UpliftingNews,removed,things cease to be virtuous and positive if they are mandated be happy or be banished
UpliftingNews,removed,i may be in the minority here but i think black friday is a more important holiday than thanksgiving if fact the idea behind most holidays is really only orientated to a certain group black friday on the other hand is orientated to everyone
UpliftingNews,removed,i get that the news posts should be uplifting but why do individual comments in discussions on this subreddit have to be uplifting
UpliftingNews,removed,reddit moderators are the scum of the earth im really glad you guys are a union
UpliftingNews,removed,its because people only care about a topic when it effects them im sure football players and everyone who contributes to the event would love to be home reddit has a large retail worker or past retail worker demographic so youll see a lot of fuck black friday on reddit popular opinion in the public is to continue black friday
UpliftingNews,removed,then theyll fire them all and replace them with the massive amount of teenagers who would do it for
UpliftingNews,removed,wow thats like so bold
UpliftingNews,removed,the kicker is that they dont make you work those days you could easily say no and find a different job it is not like it is a difficult job to get that requires skills and education you choose to work those days for the holiday pay and you know it
UpliftingNews,removed,dont be too proud i would put money on its some scheme perpetrated by triple the canadian jews that own the mall they have been having a really hard time getting other peoples money for the meadowlands american dream again these are canadian jews that own these brands construction complete its only been years of we dont want to spend our money we want to spend your money source they are headquartered in my building
UpliftingNews,removed,this is becoming common practice in a majority of subs on reddit and other forums i frequent i disagree with it to my core even in a sub dedicated to uplifting news you cannot tell people that their voice must be trimmed and dressed up to fit the subject matter people feel how they feel as long as they arent attacking someone else in a wildly disrespectful manner mods have no business threatening action against people who come off as negative
UpliftingNews,removed,no the point of this subreddit is to get away from the news negativity otherwise it would just be called ruplifting or rnonegativity
UpliftingNews,removed,bold stance against terrorists attacks
UpliftingNews,removed,cyber monday is also without any real deals yet another manufactured event claiming endless deals in a cynical gestures to get rubes to buy merch
UpliftingNews,removed,thats what the mods put there i personally disagree with their choice and was asking a mod why uplifting news has to be uplifting news and only uplifting comments
UpliftingNews,removed,that comic is not applicable whatsoever to this particular argument this isnt one user being a dick and getting cut off because everyones tired of it this is policy regarding any and all discussion had in the future big difference and if all its meant to say is dont be a dick then maybe thats what it should say because thats not what the mods post communicated dont be a dick and dont be negative are two very different things and represent two very different sets of implications
UpliftingNews,removed,wow just take away a feature and everyone thinks your brave s
UpliftingNews,removed,the larger problem is working at walmart for years do something with your damn life already
UpliftingNews,removed,thats too passive steal shit from there
UpliftingNews,removed,okay mom i will respect your safe space we all know how bad dissenting opinions are
UpliftingNews,removed,this dude gonna get caught in a drive by outside some project over haagen das
UpliftingNews,removed,im not necessarily disagreeing with you but buffalo is the most segregated city in the us its not going to be the base camp of a nationwide race war but it isnt a golden picture of perfect diversity
UpliftingNews,removed,heh dudes have been selling ice cream like that for years in my neighborhood i guess the cool thing is that he gives away some if you answer trivia correctly
UpliftingNews,removed,we can agree to disagree but there is really no need for personal insults this subreddit is meant to be a place free of excessive cynicism negativity and bitterness healthy skepticism is fine under certain circumstances but toxic attitudes are not welcome here
UpliftingNews,removed,usually a guy giving away ice cream isnt seen as a high payout
UpliftingNews,removed,or a foot being in the crease
UpliftingNews,removed,question to kid what day was the declaration of independence signed question to kid x solve for x question to me what were the outcomes of wwi and how did they contribute to the causes of wwii
UpliftingNews,removed,um no
UpliftingNews,removed,oh so we deprive black kids of the education to know the answers to math and history questions then we punish them when they display that lack of knowledge by denying them ice cream great more condescending paternalism from the white man you know who abraham lincoln was you deserve a treat then whos a good boy white people will never cease to disgust me always looking for new ways to degrade and humiliate black children
UpliftingNews,removed,i am surrounded by people who would say why should some kids get free ice cream when i have to pay for mine they should get a job and buy their own damned ice cream etc while blaming all the ills of the world on lazy liberals minorities and islam yay bible belt
UpliftingNews,removed,in my town the ice creamcyle guy dicky dee guy got robbed when he rode his bike through the hood
UpliftingNews,removed,just a small town girl
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe you feel it is so nonexistent because it is so extremely extremely segregated
UpliftingNews,removed,too bad the last time we were this far up the front page was that racist woman at airport plaza she doesnt define our city this is much better
UpliftingNews,removed,but he is white i thought all white people were racist bigots i guess i was wrong about them after all
UpliftingNews,removed,i predict this is going to be reddit hugged honestly i kinda hope it is
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,everyone from buffalo we made the news over something nonmurder related d
UpliftingNews,removed,i hope this doesnt happen c
UpliftingNews,removed,free diabetes for poor kids come and get it i am suspicious of all adults who try to get close to kids is seemingly altruistic ways buyer beware
UpliftingNews,removed,the liberal white guilt is strong with this one
UpliftingNews,removed,thats pretty condescending
UpliftingNews,removed,so hes just out there fattening up the nerds

UpliftingNews,removed,was a nice area far before it was a min wages
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,square up nigga
UpliftingNews,removed,youre not doing anyone any favors by spreading disinformation i fully grasp that you are not the original content provider but you dont have to mindlessly post an article and purposefully mislead internet strangers theres no one stopping you from posting or saying anything youd like but you cant say im wrong this post has a fully editable title field and your name underneath you chose the title it could have been anything you know what else is a buzzkill when youve had a couple beers and you did well earlier that day so you can buy a little more crack than normal and as soon as you do the cops arrest you for dui and possession but you dont see anyone complaining about that also im certain that no child from this article saw my post and if they did i certainly didnt ruin their time
UpliftingNews,removed,no nigga is not no ice cream for you
UpliftingNews,removed,how many times has he been assaulted for not giving it to them for free when they got the question wrong
UpliftingNews,removed,i wonder if he has been robbed

UpliftingNews,removed,so when they get wrong he tells them to fuck off
UpliftingNews,removed,racial tensions are nearly nonexistent here in buffalo are you white though maybe you dont see racial tension but blacks in buffalo may still feel racial tension towards you
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet he gives it to the black kids anyway
UpliftingNews,removed,thats actually pretty fucked up because the real troubled youth are going to be far less likely to answer those questions further entrenching privilege im half joking
UpliftingNews,removed,not cool dude thats a micro aggression brah

UpliftingNews,removed,racist
UpliftingNews,removed,i hate to be a downer here but you people should not be feeling proud of buffalo right now if some guy doing something as small as handing out some free ice cream makes you proud of your city then it is in dire straits its extremely upsetting to read people claiming they are proud of buffalo when people were murdered a little over a week ago right where i live another two people and years old shot dead on a street not too far from my apartment and another handful a few months ago this guy has something to be proud of but you people nothing especially the long term buffalonians you let this place turn to shit

UpliftingNews,removed,disadvantaged
UpliftingNews,removed,isnt the point of being sick to stay in bed and gain rest
UpliftingNews,removed,this is why capitalism sucks
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet your fun at parties
UpliftingNews,removed,fart in the wind amirite
UpliftingNews,removed,a much better idea than the late
UpliftingNews,removed,assuming some of that money is coming from medicaremedicaid patients this means a portion of my tax dollars are being used to buy pokémon lures never have i been more proud to live in the us
UpliftingNews,removed,lol you might wanna re read
UpliftingNews,removed,you gotta be more social what should we do i know give them a video game
UpliftingNews,removed,surely they are capable of getting out of bed without pokemon this reddit circlejerk of pokemon is getting annoying
UpliftingNews,removed,maybe if their only motive for getting out of bed was a video game they deserve to die
UpliftingNews,removed,this is what annoys me about reddit you see something this and youre forbidden to say what an piece of it takes to do something like this
UpliftingNews,removed,httpsimgurcomgalleryvsbaw i dont think hospitals really want that
UpliftingNews,removed,the kids walked km around the hospital and found one pokemon then the servers went down
UpliftingNews,removed,put one in the mri suite and let the fun times begin
UpliftingNews,removed,and pokemon go will get them right back into the hospital bed again truly a great cycle of commercialism
UpliftingNews,removed,they should try medicine
UpliftingNews,removed,wow something interesting has finally come of the scourge
UpliftingNews,removed,but this is the stupidest trend some people have ever seen s
UpliftingNews,removed,i was disappointed when this wasnt about the television show
UpliftingNews,removed,i dont know what kind of sick kids you got over there but what ive seen is the sick kids who should walk you couldnt keep them on the bed if you tried
UpliftingNews,removed,childrens parents use pokemon go to get lazy kids out of bed
UpliftingNews,removed,pokemon go is definitely not made to be where i live at all it breaks my heart because i absolutely love pokemon but when you walk around for minutes and find one pokemon with two phones while somebody with one phone finds pokemon in an hour with no lure well you tend to get discouraged
UpliftingNews,removed,and poodlecorp is still going to try to take it down
UpliftingNews,removed,downvoted you for defending pokemon outside of
UpliftingNews,removed,pokemon go cured my addiction to crack cocaine true story
UpliftingNews,removed,but thats how they got cancer in the first place

UpliftingNews,removed,autism is over diagnosed now a days
UpliftingNews,removed,his zs identify as ss
UpliftingNews,removed,measures included dimmed fluorescent lighting and a ban on music and i store announcements followed by nerve gas
UpliftingNews,removed,hopefully in the future we can detect autism quicker in the pregnancy and abort the fetus so there isnt an issue like this
UpliftingNews,removed,great maybe you can try and learn not to be a dick about it in the future
UpliftingNews,removed,damn dude you really are an asshole an autistic asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,ok you are a smug autistic asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,no no its a special thing with autism i have seen parents almost using the autism their children have as some kind of trophy
UpliftingNews,removed,oh boy anxiety can be a symptom of many mental disorders i intended to cut you off before but i forgot your username that wont happen again good night
UpliftingNews,removed,your joke died before you even finished it
UpliftingNews,removed,a nuke would do fucking nothing you cant just go nuke a country because you want to and who the fuck would listen to that order
UpliftingNews,removed,it may be easier to let him take the plunge the autistic are bound to lead unfulfilling lives
UpliftingNews,removed,i always have a problem with stories like this if you can afford to work at a low wage like tjis than you have other income from corporations buying your influence
UpliftingNews,removed,provided you survive long enough to get it
UpliftingNews,removed,no such thing as a free lunch you pay for it with taxes wise investment
UpliftingNews,removed,not free paid for by people with jobs stop fucking calling things you dont pay for free
UpliftingNews,removed,it isnt free anywhere massive taxes pay for it
UpliftingNews,removed,i bet youre a riot at parties
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,you just dont understand love faggot
UpliftingNews,removed,you are justextremely stupid

UpliftingNews,removed,no public servant salaries should be determined by charity if people feel as though the public servant did their job hen they will be rewarded its called servant for a reason they dont deserve a guaranteed salary
UpliftingNews,removed,no wtf they belong in africa protect them in africa
UpliftingNews,removed,why is this good news they kill like thousands every year as it is
UpliftingNews,removed,
UpliftingNews,removed,soon to be down after they kill the tiger in that chinese drivethrough park
UpliftingNews,removed,good job tigers keep on afucking
UpliftingNews,removed,steady diet of women should improve those numbers
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah but now theyre eating people you see that shit in china tiger just came up andtookthat lady theyre coming back with a hunger for human meat
UpliftingNews,removed,the last thing we need is more of these monsters terrorizing the planet
UpliftingNews,removed,also horrifying news
UpliftingNews,removed,time to give myself downvotes ahem why the fuck arent we killing these fuckers
UpliftingNews,removed,not surprising the chinese even feed them people
UpliftingNews,removed,boycott sodastream it is made in occupied land stolen from the palestinians
UpliftingNews,removed,coming from a place where a civil war broke out between different religious groups i feel i have a slightly different perspective the only things at this point that could realistically end that war are the genocide of palestinians it is not likely to go the other way around due to israels military power or a very long period of time to where all the injuredbigoted people die off it would most likely take a few generations after all hostilities cease for moderate reasonable people on both sides to come to power
UpliftingNews,removed,with the big difference being that jews didnt blow themselves up in german coffee shops or stab german soldiers on the streets
UpliftingNews,removed,as a jew i dont understand how israel can justify this kind of treatment to palestinians after how we got treated in germany and eastern europe as a person with a brain i dont understand how people cant see that all that comes from gaza is terrorism they elected a terrorist goverment intentionally target civilians bus bombings rocket launches at schools etc yet everyone demonizes israel
UpliftingNews,removed,muslim leaders urge hamas to stop launching rockets at schools said no one ever
UpliftingNews,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrkvacyyuxke
UpliftingNews,removed,well atleast they have of them to make it seem like they care bunch of kikes back into the oven with all of them
UpliftingNews,removed,do you honestly think that that the israeli government is as bad as the nazis and that current palestinians are being treated as badly as the jews in the holocaust
UpliftingNews,removed,this is bullshit and its not what i said in my comment
UpliftingNews,removed,where are the ovens and gas chambers
UpliftingNews,removed,zionists vs jews my friend
UpliftingNews,removed,oyvey this is like another shoah
UpliftingNews,removed,nothing will be done by anyone
UpliftingNews,removed,you mean like what happens to palestine on a regular basis look at the difference between what palestine and israel look like you fucking idiot how you could in any way defend what israel has done to them makes you comparable to a nazi sympathizer you are literally sympathizing with a country that is trying to eradicate an entire culture and race what the fuck are you on
UpliftingNews,removed,i am so happy to hear it sometimes from the outside it feels theres such a large jewish movement that supports this kind of violence i remind myself it is just the right wing israeli government which are the exception the world will jot be destroyed by those who do evil but by those who watch them without doing anything another famous jew
UpliftingNews,removed,and here i was thinking it was an article about saving the fur suit variety of furry
UpliftingNews,removed,wow thats it i am fucking done i dont believe you right now just kidding this is getting laughably stupid have a good day you ass
UpliftingNews,removed,youre an asshole
UpliftingNews,removed,httpsgithubcommethodocracymethodocracyorg
UpliftingNews,removed,and the golan heights west bank i think theyre a little more opportunistic than you imagine
UpliftingNews,removed,jews were driven out of almost every european kingdom back in the medieval days multiple reasons that i neither credit as fact or disregard as myth
UpliftingNews,removed,or the rest of the world
UpliftingNews,removed,amongst other state bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,except palestinians never invaded palestine dont want to start an argument here but it really isnt thousands of years old the british mandate was a good start
UpliftingNews,removed,first of all i dont vape second of all i literally posted that picture of dog the bounty hunter to trigger people like you thank you for the laugh
UpliftingNews,removed,i am exactly the same however as much as i find inexcusable violence from both sides i still feel in this way systematic evil in the form of a government is far worse than violent grass roots chaos i pray for a benevolent transparent occupation one that gives arabs respect and rights with israelis feeling secure that their land is not volatile there will be fanatics on both sides who will push for the most extreme conclusion of the enemy but as long as the man parties in power are moderate and interested in communication then there is hope
UpliftingNews,removed,so i took seconds to look at your post history and i think i just found where you posted a photo of yourself why am i not surprised
UpliftingNews,removed,israel should never have happened you cant just take a ton of european jews and relocate them to a country that was promised in a holy book made a few thousand years ago you cant just tell the people who have lived their for centuries that they are giving their land up because europe didnt want to deal with extra jews jews muslims and christians all got along before israel showed up even the british didnt allow it a great many were illegal once the british shut the gate for anymore immigration
UpliftingNews,removed,and they build mass apartment blocks because
UpliftingNews,removed,i love seeing my tax dollars used to buy equipment that will probably never get used to make a bunch of incompetent pet owners feel better about themselves
UpliftingNews,removed,the zionists came in droves after wwii even when the british mandate made it illegal to continue to immigrate history buff
UpliftingNews,removed,you didnt know read up its amazing how these people have been persecuted usually blamed from ruining the economy from the inside
UpliftingNews,removed,i am not clicking that link because bull shit made up reason stay safe in your little bubble you are a fucking retard of massive proportions i hope whatever desert youre in gets bombed so you can experience what its like
UpliftingNews,removed,i think when we look at the international ties the historical negotiations that have been made and mossads operations within other nations governments we see a picture of one of the most brilliant but devious purposes ever size to achievement comparison nothing comes close not even the usa currently they are building connections like no tomorrow in australia i particularly relish in the evidence they were close to selling nukes to apartheid south africa what a change in history that might have been
UpliftingNews,removed,actually a great many christians and even original jews were against the mass immigration of zionists they found their homeland being invaded
UpliftingNews,removed,this comment section is pretty messed up i a guessing it gets locked in the next hour
UpliftingNews,removed,and when the british prevented anymore immigration the zionists formed militia and attacked the british very friendly
UpliftingNews,removed,oh jesus christ you little fucking baby whiner i have your ip and im coming for you run
UpliftingNews,removed,hey guess what cockbag a lot of firefighters are happy and very willing to save animals after their owners are safe not everyone is a massive cocksleeve like you
UpliftingNews,removed,if my brother was a furry id just tell the fire department to let him burn
UpliftingNews,removed,is there one that saves them from cops who mistakingly break into the wrong home and shoot your dog when it goes to defend you from intruders
UpliftingNews,removed,haha i destroyed you
UpliftingNews,removed,to be fair kid kept running even when she was found what is her home life like
UpliftingNews,removed,for those wooshing about the comments below regarding httpsenwikipediaorgwikifurryfandom
UpliftingNews,removed,what about furries who are family members
UpliftingNews,removed,that is one of the older comics from xkcd for the curious
UpliftingNews,removed,hopefully her future husband doesnt sue her when genetics come out to play
UpliftingNews,removed,at first i thought but why would you wanna save furies then i realized op meant pets so carry on
UpliftingNews,removed,i think i saw one of her friends on the cover of mad years ago
UpliftingNews,removed,id save my dog over your life times over sorry brah
UpliftingNews,removed,people not animals
UpliftingNews,removed,you asked me to call you an asshole so here you go you are an asshole and in the wrong subreddit take you negativity elsewhere byeee
UpliftingNews,removed,furry family members about time i understand furries face discrimination but not even rescuing them from burning buildings is a bit too far
UpliftingNews,removed,nope ur still a faget
UpliftingNews,removed,man i was gonna come in and make the opposite joke about being glad i wont have to worry about whether the fire department can save the furries i know
UpliftingNews,removed,modern medicine because fuck you god not today bitch
UpliftingNews,removed,silly me thinking about actual furries jeez
UpliftingNews,removed,savethefurries
UpliftingNews,removed,this is the opposite of liberty liberty would be the employee and the employer being allowed to be free to enter into a contractagreemnet as they see fit one component of which may be the requirement or lack thereof to check work email when theyre not at work
UpliftingNews,removed,goodsoabout those shark fins
UpliftingNews,removed,now if china could also just stop considering every endangered animal a delicacy or cure for impotence or boththat would be great
UpliftingNews,removed,a game changer this isnt a game theyre mutilating animals as well as so many going extinct this year along with ones dwindling on numbers and theyre titling this news like life is worthless makes me sick
UpliftingNews,removed,so china will murder every last elephant for ivory by december that way it stops
UpliftingNews,removed,i really hope they also stop their illegal fishing boats from literally scrapping off the ocean floor and decimating the ecosystem in chinese and foreign waters
UpliftingNews,removed,yea and i vow to stop drinking smoking and eating fast foods in srsly
UpliftingNews,removed,now they need to work on all the other animal parts that the absurd chinese medicine people poach leopards bears etc
UpliftingNews,removed,yeah theyl get every last penny out before though fucking sick they know the problem and have known for years yet the keep allowing it also tigers slaughtered bears drained of bile animal welfare and good treatment in china is nonexistent disgusting behaviour for what is supposedly a civilised society
UpliftingNews,removed,meanwhile here in the us the incoming administration would say those regulations are jobkillers and unnecessary anyway because the incoming potus has seen there are plenty of elephants being shown on tv
UpliftingNews,removed,wiping out african elephants wiping out tigers wiping out pangolins raping and polluting africa for gold illegal fishing and wiping out fish stocks off the coasts of africachina is the the century version of the century european african continent rapist
UpliftingNews,removed,or chinese people could have stopped being pieces of shit who buy poached tusks about years ago and the whole trade could have died off but no gotta have my shark fin soup while sprinkling rhino horn on my dong real geniuses
UpliftingNews,removed,lolololololol hahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhaahhahaha
UpliftingNews,removed,sum ting wong ho lee fuk wi tu lo
UpliftingNews,removed,okay thats quite nice but it could have been or you know
UpliftingNews,removed,all of my niggas is gamechangers
UpliftingNews,removed,its about fing time all these people yacking about how superior traditional chinese medicine is meanwhile they are grounding up endangered species into powders to use as medicine do you know insane this is so like if you have memory problems or want to live longer they ground up an elephant because they are known to live long and have good memories i mean this is what insanity looks like
UpliftingNews,removed,if i was president i would just hunt the ivory poachers and traders down and fuck them with an ivory strap on until they promised not to do it anymore
UpliftingNews,removed,not people just the chinese they also think beating dogs to death before eating them make the meat taste better there is a reason the japanese didnt consider the chinese people when they did atrocious things to them dont read the massacre of nanking it will ruin your day
UpliftingNews,removed,damn i knew the chinese were stupid but not this much god damn im glad the japs did that stuff to them
UpliftingNews,removed,oh see we promise we rove the erephants
UpliftingNews,removed,oh see we promise we rove the erephants
UpliftingNews,removed,a bit late to comment but sri lanka carried out a huge event where most ivory and whole tusks were collected and crushed to powder to make it unsellable and discourage poachers not to mention the death penalty if caught killing elephants though no one is killed nowadays
UpliftingNews,removed,okra isnt exotic dude
UpliftingNews,removed,ah ignorance is bliss aint it here ya go they have a wonderful tradition of tenderizing innocent dogs before cooking and eating them listen to the howls and cries of pain good ol china tho yay
UpliftingNews,removed,the little chink got mad
UpliftingNews,removed,the little chink got mad hehe xd
UpliftingNews,removed,another chink blocked
UpliftingNews,removed,sweet ops mom will be happy
UpliftingNews,removed,it would be nice if there was a new breed of poachers who poach other poachers to put a halt to all this senseless poachery
UpliftingNews,removed,the poachers will follow their meal tickets to any end start asking for donations towards weaponry to eliminate the human threat and make this world a better place i would also put the dead poacher heads on sticks around the periphery of your territory for good measure
UpliftingNews,removed,hb p
UpliftingNews,removed,dumb fucking cat deserve to die now it has to play final destination till it gets a gruesome death
UpliftingNews,removed,people stupid enough to believe that rhino horn will give them a boner will never know the difference anyway people who use rhino horn arent using it for sexual purposes theyre using it as a status symbol its a big thing over in asia people eating endangered animals is just a status symbol to them the more rare or endangered the animal youre eating obvious means the more powerful you are right like that video of asian tourists at an allyoucaneat buffet gathering around shrimp and using plates to scoop shrimp onto other plates theyre not eating the shrimp theyre leaving big plates on their table to show off httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqbclxzmmqns its just their culture their shitty disgusting culture
UpliftingNews,removed,i saw nfl player and years and my brain automatically read promise as prison note i know larry fitzgerald is a heck of guy on and off the field so it had nothing to do with him
UpliftingNews,removed,majored in comminications yeah maybe going back to pitt wouldnt have been much better
UpliftingNews,removed,here in canada over half of our elementary school teachers coming out of teaching college cant do elementary school arithmetic math like fractions source
UpliftingNews,removed,just goes to show that we dont need to know it any more why dont we teach kids how to do stone engraving skin boars ride horses start fires identify safe wild berries and follow animal tracks its almost like we dont need those skills any more
UpliftingNews,removed,can you imagine how hard it is to waste your time going back for a degree when you dont need it well first off thats ridiculous not everybody who puts the work in to get a degree is doing so improve their outlook when looking for a job people have interestssome of which they can further get into by attending a place of higher education in fact youre kind of explaining the thought process that many college athletes experience when choose their major hell i just got a football to alabama i wont need a degree when im making all pro money in the nfl ill just wing it with some useless degree i wont need it anyways also keep in mind that he signed an endorsement deal with the university of phoenix in same year that he started doing classes at the university of phoenix not to mention that uop has their damn name on the cardinals stadiumthe dude essentially got paid to get the degree works for both parties really fitzgerald gets paid to get a degree while fulfilling his mothers dying wish in the process uop gets great press win win good to see fitzgerald is already putting that marketing degree to good use of employers dont ask and dont care where the degrees come from that is bullshit
UpliftingNews,removed,not fractions specifically but it was a general remark about how we learn so much useless stuff the way learn is through repetition our brain has no reason to keep something we only ever think of once people not knowing supposedly embarrassingly simple facts such as fractions as you pointed out but not only that is only because people have no need for them if they needed them theyd know them you use fractions every day so of course youd know them i never said theyre not useful to anyone just the vast majority funnily enough not everyone in the world does the same job as you learn it for what the very fact they dont know it means they dont need it whats the point of wasting time forcing yourself to retain pieces of information you never ever use that makes no sense
UpliftingNews,removed,there are plenty of pro athletes that leave early and return to the university to complete their degrees the most notable is juwan howard he made a promise to his grandmother that hed complete his degree on the day he signed his letter of intent to play basketball at the university of michigan as part of the fab his grandmother passed away juwan left early for the nba however he didnt wait until he finished his playing career he continued his classes concurrently with his nba career and graduated on time with his class at michigan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have no problem with transgender but i think a birth certificate is a matter of public record recording an event and this case it indicates sex a biological distinction rather than a gender one at birth this person was born female
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is literally exactly not uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all i have to say is she literally has the figure that women want with a corset without one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how on earth is this uplifting if she wants to make a point about not wearing traditional female attire she should play belle in a set of addidas sweats actually id totally watch that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,spoiled brat refuses to play the roll shes supposed to upliftingnews what
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so much negative feedback in these comments to each their own i think emma watson is doing a great job of being a positive role model for young girls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know why this is uplifting because women are held to the standard of beauty especially when acting emma watson is a hero for standing up and saying no to the health threatening affects of corsets i realize some of you might not be aware but corsets can cause serious damage especially to the bone structure that was built specifically to protect vulnerable organs by constricting the lower ribs and for what because society says small waists are sexy if she had said yes it would further affect young girls who already suffer from beauty standards we just want to feel beautiful in our own bodies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you have time can you explain why
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well that is one way the story could be told while the two stories would share that semisimilar commentary they would also have many opposing ones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,role
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was a choice the films creators supported her on in the beginning stages of casting not that she was being a brat on set maybe i should have rephrased the title it would certainly be inappropriate and plain nonsensical for actors to make demands like that i appreciate watson for being mindful and at least giving thought towards what she presents to the world not just looking to extend her fame and take the biggest roles available
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can be a feminist and play a princess in movie i hate to break that to you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for the props the comments are harsh and im always surprised at how sincerely i take them i shouldnt but oh well didnt mean to start a gender war thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she isnt she is teaching them to see themselves as victims of male dominance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,corsets are made to draw in the stomach and waist and uplift the ribcage and bosom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets start earlier than that can you explain whats uplifting about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was a choice the films creators supported her on in the beginning stages of casting not that she was being a brat on set she was a spoiled brat far before this article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,didnt mean to start a gender war i find this statement dubious as you crafted the title and then assigned it to uplifting news thereby planting the seed then you added fuel to the fire by intentionally ignoring the welldone pun response in favor of pushing a feminist ideal of course the pun itself could be considered misogynistic or maybe we are all too stuck in technology have lost actual social skills and have nothing better to do than be offended by stupid crap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this goes way further beyond what my post presented i wont disagree that mostly women described as victims in this topic are in fact continuing the trend that hurts them i wont even fact check the size of the industry you state the point of your message is still accurate take it one step further though and consider that people spend hours on their appearance out of fear some people are legitimately scared to leave the house without makeup its not easy to look willingly different from the norm my coworker came to work without eye makeup for the first time and i witnessed many other coworkers blatantly tell her she looked hung over and unrested which she genuinely wasnt like it was funny and appropriate to make jokes that insinuate a person who chooses to wear their own face to an office job is an indicator of their dedication or work ethic shes not a model her business does not depend on her beauty at all this is an opinion but that is not fair in my mind many victims contribute to their own demise it is so common that when a victim finds the courage to go against that behavior their description changes from victim to survivor or champion some people think its fair to blame victims i dont what you said is a fact but i propose that not all situations are black and white no one person or group is to blame for the fear some people feel about their appearances but there is fear and that is sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except the women themselves its a selfinflicted wound so when theres an article about a police shooting do you say this is just men shooting other men selfinflicted wound really who cares it doesnt matter who is pushing an agenda if you dont like it you fight back the article doesnt mention men once but every other redditor with a dick feels slighted by it emma watson doesnt want to wear a corset why does she hate me triggered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if your statement were true our society would not celebrate and lust after women who have changed their appearance its seriously disgusting the images and sexualization is plastered everywhere and there for corrodes ideals of what women should look like women are often confronted about their appearences all the time i was when a boy whom i never even dated told me that if i were to ever get fat that he would shoot me i was also the same age when i was voted in my class for smallest breasts this criticism hurts believe me until the media normalizes womens bodies women cant feel comfortable in their own skin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also if your statement was true her declining to wear a corset would never have even reached the internet if hollywood never asked actresses to change their appearances wed live in a better world for sure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,underrated comment im sorry your pun went unappreciated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no problem i should be studying but ill do this instead i have a couple of reasons to start an extremely cinched waist is not integral to the plot anyway she still looks like a traditional beautiful princess to me i look at her and see belle still not to mention this is a fantasy world so although historically many princesses wore corsets watsons costume being historically accurate isnt necessary its uplifting to see vanity not being prioritized above the ethics of the actresses in hollywood yes movies ought to be pleasing to look at and visually a film ought to support the theme and message of the film no problem this is a new version of an old fairytale if they want belle to be less century proper whatever im a big fan of the show mad men and the accuracy in that shows costumes and behaviors provided me with an appreciation for the way society is now the whole premise of the show is based on a time and place that actually happened its realistic and i adore it for that the way women are treated in that story is not told in a context that encourages that behavior should be reintegrated also although an actors or actresses main duty is to take directions not give them actresses have an upsetting history of being abused in hollywood sometimes being forced to take part in telling a story that disrespects them as people or dehumanizes who they are outside of work any employer that does that is not considerate their jobs are not always easy it is uplifting to see watsons ethics even being considered it it uplifting to see an extremely popular actress with some kind of ethics the corset wasnt necessary watson didnt prefer it the reasoning for that preference aside i thought it was uplifting news that they listened to her and then even agreed with her and this is news because unlike most careers there is no expectations for an actresses values to be respected of course she did not have to take this role but had she been in a show with a contract that she had signed prior to the continuous changes they would have thrown her contract in her face and told her to stop talking sure she signed a contract but that would be upsetting news watsons choice is setting a pattern to not dehumanize an actress simply because she is pretending to be a human that isnt herself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt know that id like to know more if you have examples
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except that this post has nothing to do with men its about women setting an example for other women gender war is mysoginistic phrase i think its accurate but sorry it hurt your feelings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know what youre right you should be studying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for taking the time to thoroughly explain how important this is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no its about a woman throwing down the gauntlet and refusing to don the evil trappings of the patriarchy burn that corset right before the bra right sister 😉
UpliftingNews,not_removed,totally i agree with you on that marketing is a necessary field for many reasons my post is not making the claim that the production of corsets should be stopped or that promoting them is immoral rather that it is uplifting that the severely uncomfortable and although less likely but inarguably relevant life threatening trend of corsets is no longer an absolute standard to maintain the realness and magic of the fantasy world in a movie created for children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as an actress thats unheard of in a world where the producers would force their actresses to have abortions and also drug them the teen actress who played dorthy in the wizard of oz was often overtired from filming and was then put on pills to keep her peppy to be in the business is to be poked and prodded into what society wants sending a terrible message to young viewers argue as you like but this is reality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ayyyeee we agree on something i appreciate your input on the discussion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont feel that way at all haha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre arguing about a corseta corset nobody cares if you dont want to wear it then dont if emma doesnt want to wear it then she wont crying about something that doesnt even matter that doesnt even warrant seconds of thought ohh but poor you you poor little girl aww we all have to make sure your feelings are okay a corset but society society is oppressing me and keeping me down im a victim the corset is destroying my life oh the horror the humanity waahhhhh grow some ovaries and woman the fuck up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mkay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love how you argue to not waste effort on the topic but you keep coming back to comment lmao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im arguing because assholes like you arent seeing the big picture here speaking out against hollywood is unheard of at a female standpoint anyway if a star in the said she didnt want to wear a corset the producers would have made her because of their contract or otherwise blacklisted her i never played the victim card rather give examples of the reality of women to misogynistic men who overlook what women go through no im not crying in fact this uplifting news makes me excited for the future thanks for checking in though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just want others to see the good in this easier said than done lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets all hold hands and chant together correlation does not equal causation correlation does not equal causation correlation does not equal causation correlation does not equal causation correlation does not equal causation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does browsing reddit count p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats ridiculous i dont read at all and am perfectly hea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well im not a scientist but if you have enough time to read something every day then you probably have a or hours job in other words someone who reads have more time to rest thus have longer lifespan in my case i work hours shifts i read a lot like hours per day but in my pc during work pretty sure i will die when i got around years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read a book for min every morning like clock work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,study shows of statistics are made up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol what a bunch of crapbtw another article from the source httpsfoodgoodisarticlesyouremuggingitwrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whoopy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,enjoy a longer life than nonreaders maybe thats because they have books to keep them occupied in their old age assuming they can still see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,htf can that have any effect on getting cancer or a heart attack or hit by a bus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what are you dear voracious readers going to do with your extra months on this earth you spent them reading if someone starts reading for the longevity benefits then theyre pretty much going to break even
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill happily enjoy a shorter life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,inside cats live longer than outside cats
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so i just need to read more on reddit so i can read more reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably because a longer life without reading books would be boring and pointless i know i wouldnt enjoy a longer life if i couldnt break open a good book once in a while
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah because were sitting inside reading instead of out driving around getting muggedor going snowboarding or whatever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read all damn day on reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does it depend what they read
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well ill also have to have friends too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i sure hope this minutes counts reddit as reading time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,last time we did that a demon got summoned not saying that the act of chanting cause the summoning
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly the first thing i think when i read something like this is that there are so many other factors that could be at play here people who spend a half an hour everyday reading probably have at least some free time for relaxation there might be some who are so into reading that they use time they really dont have they might be more conscientious about selfimprovement and they are likely more highly educated than their nonreading counterparts those things also might not be true but they are important to keep in mind when reading about studies suggesting that x makes you live longer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it says magazines and newspapers do so reddit probably counts too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn straight it does
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i came here to make that comment but i was too late
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you read the title though didnt you eh get up off the floor come on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly and you probably achieve the same goal of living longer by doing any number of other restful activities like i dont know stare out the window for hour per day im personally quite tired of these craparticles if this is science nowadays then were screwed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe but if a person is reading they arent driving or doing other dangerous activites
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe but if a person is reading they arent driving or doing other dangerous activites
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why are your clocks only accurate to the minute interval
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol my thoughts exactly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are not mutually exclusive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fear not twas just the mighty demon of basic scientific literacy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it saddens me that your post wont get the gold and thousands of upvotes it deserves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my immediate hunch is that those who develop such a habit likely grew up around books which is a key indicator of good socioeconomic status which in turn is a considerable factor in longevity what you say about having sufficient free time is also an indicator of good socioeconomic status as with being better educated a far more plausible avenue to pursue one cant help but feel than that given by the piece that reading is good for the soul then again its possible such things were in fact controlled for by those who did the study and the reporting not the study is at fault
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in light of that ill see you on my birthday remindme years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sooplaying text heavy rpgs would count
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats just how i read reading longer than a hr makes my eyes hurt lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well if hes gonna grill me on whether or not a third party has ever got the same reproducible results as me im pulling out the holy water and sending it back to hell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of years to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah lol some of us are bound to live forever but is this immortality worth the price
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes but you still wont live quite as long as those that read the ingredients off their shampoo bottles every morning
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was a dumb joke because you said like clock work you were right not to get it

UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someones gotta pay the lunch lady
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think this is uplifting news if anything its the exact opposite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aside from this being immensely rude and tasteless its freaking sunday a day of rest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is uplifting because
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill give good odds hes involved in a sex scandal in the next years

UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait what isnt this belong to rnottheonion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,downlifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone needs to start another war whenever there is no war the elected people start creating nonexistent problems and implement more needless legislations to protect us from our own freedoms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because op thinks uplifting news is a soap box to broadcast their political views they arent the first to do it either
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am looking at for a map
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was thinking the same
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i got a clue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is a town called ontario in california so the cat could have been close the whole time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i swear to god if my lost cat winds up in cali i aint getting the prick he got himself there he can get back i dont think hed want to come back anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the abbreviations are close to ontario ca vs ontario can i can see how the poor lil guy got confused
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn i need to brush up on my geography i didnt even know this lmao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most canadians use ca for canada as it is so really they are both ontario ca
UpliftingNews,not_removed,will the victim get to keep the teddy bear or will it get taken away and reused for the next victim
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is already the case here in the netherlands in our policecar we have traumabears which we hand out to children in these kind of situations
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rwholesomepolice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know its a bit unrelated but i hope its ok to share interactions like this are awesome from police and i wish more would do it when i was a kid middle school age i believe i was riding my bike on the road against traffic as it was in a small town had my helmet on a police officer is driving by in my direction and pulls me over we turned down the street and i was like wtf was i on the wrong side of the road officer noticed my helmet and the organization was working with a companygroup to hand out a coupon that entitled me to a couple things for proper safety he was super nice talked to me for a bit about bike safety and thought it was awesome i was wearing my helmet gave me the coupon and went on the way it was a cool interaction with police
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we do the same thing on our fire department apparatus canadian volunteer fire department happily i have never had to give one out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tactical teddies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the money will go to buy clean transport and store the bears which the children are free to take home with them or swap for another at their local police station
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought this was done here i had heard of this in canada before ontario canada here its a simple thing but i bet it means the world to those kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this story is amazing and unusual i would like to see how they will explain this to the kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at that age i say you do whatever the fuck that makes you happy good for her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uplifting because davies who married when she was eventually came out to her supportive wife in her wife to whom she was married for years bought davies jewelry and dresses that she could wear in private she is nearing the end of her life and doesnt have much time left if taking estrogen and opening up publicly is what she wants to do then by all means go for it it takes courage to do what she is doing knowing that not everyone will be as understanding as her wife was it probably isnt just about selfish motives she likely wants to help other transgender people not have to hide in shame
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she knew for years could you imagine living a lie for years its funny because so many young trans people are told nowadays that its just a phase an entire lifetime could be a phase i suppose
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some of these comments arent so uplifting go her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck i shouldve known better the news may be uplifting the comments are not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what the fuck is wrong with all you people how does something like this affect you so greatly that you have to spew so much hatred
UpliftingNews,not_removed,itt ignorance and transphobia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nothing makes me angrier than closeminded people judging without attempting to understand fuck that you dont even need to understand the choices others make but respect their right to do whatever the fuck they want
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sad to see all this hatred i am trans yself to why do people think its something to harras about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey better late than never
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shehe looks fucking fabulous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for a second i thought he was coming out as ben franklin rock on sirmadam or whatever your pronoun of choice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is this even considered news im happy for him or her for pursuing their own preferred lifestyle but im pretty sure this kind of stuff happens all the time not really uplifting or news imo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as much as i dont understand it i feel people should be able to dress or do whatever they want especially if it doesnt hurt or effect anyone else hes a veteran he sacrificed his life people deserve to be happy we are all different
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that isnt uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,serious question can i be black
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont celebrate mental delusion and physical mutilation cause someone thinksfeels they are opposite sex that being said trans people should be treated as human beings with respect but just not glorified like this pc everybody should be happy culture keeps aiming for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,relevant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,by comes out you mean develop a nasty case of gender dysphoria
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is this uplifting news

UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i guess theres no reason not to do what he wants to do when hes years old
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am enlighted person does not accept people as they want to be some people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,were all the same gender after old age is the gender ender

UpliftingNews,not_removed,rnottheonion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i saw the title i thought for sure this was for the rnottheonion sub
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why did this have to come from my country why cant some other country be retarded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats clearly georgina washington
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow good for this transgender vet realising they are not actually transgender but a woman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i say do that at any age
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also i thought this was really great patricia was inspired to make the big change from male to female after seeing the romantic comedy film boy meets girl which features transgender characters great film highly recommended to anyone who wants to see a good portrayal of a cool as hell trans person in media i just recently watched it with my very supportive boyfriend and it was awesome to see a trans girl portrayed in a realistic and positive light this i think speaks to the importance of good representation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was told my depression was just a phase fifteen years later im starting to doubt that shrugging things off as just a phase is easier than to try to understand that others are different i guess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more like itt wow so much transphobia i havent seen a single transphobic comment yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its the exact same thing as homophobia in the people were wrong then theyre wrong now it just takes the idiots a while to keep up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because people on this site are ignorant as difficult as it is to deal with discrimination and prejudice do your best to stay strong and not let it get you down too much theyre on the wrong side of history one day being transgender will be more mainstream and accepted by society
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not sure i think people have confused legitimate transgenders with tumblr kids making up nonexistent genders and pronouns to try to be unique
UpliftingNews,not_removed,growing up very upcalmost mormon lols i am curious as to how you know its different than being gay like how do you know you dont want to just like the same sex or maybe dress different how does someone one day just feel the body they were born into was wrong for them what is it that you would say is the thing that distinguishes someone from being gay to trans and does it even work like that like could someone just be happy being gay and never go trans then or are they just unrelated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some people thinks its funny its just humour
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its she she is now hormonally female hate based genetic purity arguments are in the sub with the pointy white hats they dont belong here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its her and they finally get to exist and be surrounded by people that love and support her after years if someone locked you in a cage and set you free to be surrounded by people that love you after years would the ending at least be uplifting and a diagnosed medical condition is not a lifestyle choice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you seem like a kind and charming person the kind that furthers the same perception of lgbt people the nazis did i believe the real disgrace is you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she why pretend like you are accepting when you are just stating transphobic things statements like yours are the entire reason it took her years to come out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,only because you dont care for certain types right cletus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no skin color is just skin pigment gender identity meanwhile has a biological basis with a trans person their brain is set up one way and their body another this suggests a medicial condition where the brain is wired for one set of hormones while the body produces the other so theres scientific evidence behind transgender identity birth sex sexual orentation and gender identity are three separate things each have a biological basis and one does not always correlate to another after transitioning a trans woman is hormonally female and a trans man is hormonally male therefore they could be said to be biologically the gender they identify as after medical treatment all genetic purity arguments aside and even before neurologically speaking they will never be cis nontransgender but that does little to change these facts meanwhile black people and white people have the exact same brains racial identity has no biological basis so thats why thats why its kind of a different thing so to answer your question can you be black i dont know do you have a doctors note these people do gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition for which treatment is sometimes appropriate its not a mental illness httpwwwnhsukconditionsgenderdysphoriapagesintroductionaspx
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes you can whatever makes you happy s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition for which treatment is sometimes appropriate its not a mental illness httpwwwnhsukconditionsgenderdysphoriapagesintroductionaspx just because someone has a medical condition you are too uneducated to understand that does not make them mentally ill theres enough room on this planet for all of us not everyone has to be exactly the same and i assure transgender people are not in denial about having a diagnosed medical condition they are perfectly aware i promise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not a delusion that we are the opposite sex its a desire to be the opposite sex saying i want an ice cream so i will buy one is not the same as saying i have an ice cream so im going to go buy one you are completely misrepresenting it to make trans people look bad its honestly weird that you use delusion and mutilation in one breath and then you say we should treat them with respect though uhh slander them respect them and dont glorify them im confused you seem just bitter now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a mixed bag for me on one hand im happy that she finally gets to relax and be honest about who she is but on the other hand its incredibly depressing that she has had to hide it for goddamn years i cant imagine hiding something so fundamental about yourself for so long its like you would never be able to be honest about who you are with anyone the toll that must take on someone is really upsetting i hate that society made it necessary for her safety
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is it depressing to you to many people its uplifting edit its so nice to see all the uplifting comments responding to fannypack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,point to some jokes made here calling a transgender person by the wrong pronoun isnt a joke and thats all ive really seen thats being downvoted if thats actually funny to you then i think you know why its being downvoted but also im amazed that youd really find it that chuckleworthy and phobia doesnt literally mean fear in all words case in point hemophilia would literally mean blood love if thats how words worked why dont you get mad about that one hemophiliacs dont love blood they have a biological issue with creating blood clots this word is fine but transphobia is not learn how language works before you try to critique language in practice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if someone hates you for being trans then its not a phobia it literally is a phobia is an irrational fear or hatred especially in the sociological context of the word educate yourself and these arent jokes theyre not funny its just lazy lazy lazy bigotry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a large percentage of trans people suffer afterward by realising that theyve made the wrong choice it was actually a fantasy or phase and now theyre stuck apart from your entire comment being pretty far off from whats actually the point this statement above all is categorically untrue the percentage of trans people who regret their transition is miniscule almost to the point of being statistically insignificant for you to talk about measurable facts and truth and then spout nonsense like this is beyond ironic and pretty much only meant to bolster your own opinion as fact something you just accused others of doing furthermore on the topic of science gender is far from binary there are various intersex combinations as well as examples in nature of sex andor gender evolving and mutating over time and since you dont go around checking peoples dna which can hold all sorts of surprises in anyone its a moot point source i have been involved in transgender support groups for a decade studied trans history and medicalisation am trans
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a large percentage of trans people suffer afterward by realising that theyve made the wrong choice it was actually a fantasy or phase and now theyre stuck source needed please
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at the end of the day it doesnt fucking matter if they choose to identify as a female or male so why not just respect their desire and call them what they want you dont have to have sex with them thats what it really comes down to isnt it just like people being uncomfortable with gays it makes you uncomfortable to think of them being sexual or the idea your willy might get hard for a guy dressed as a woman or you might accidentally flirt with her and find out that she was born a guy its pure narcissism that makes you deny them simply happiness because you require that the world fits into your sexual comfort zone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tolerating someones opinions tolerating someones existence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats not uplifting about this story pulling straws at nomenclature and rights all the while championing tolerance of opposing viewpoints is so deliciously hypocritical given your inability to lend tolerance toward a veteran with a different outlook on gender fluidity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its mah raht freeze peach
UpliftingNews,not_removed,remember thats it pretty hypocritical to force someone to think and act like you do while at the same time wanting to promote tolerance and diverse opinions if i want to call the veteran a man if hes biologically a man thats my right not yours to take away this paragraph is so ironic it hurts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i had gold id give it to you a wonderfully worded argument
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets look at what mental health professionals say oh look at that they say that trans people are not mentally ill that dysphoria is a serious medical condition and that transition is the only effective and medically appropriate treatment for dysphoria here is the httpwwwapaorgaboutpolicytransgenderaspx regarding the necessity and efficacy of transition as the appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria more information from the apa here is a httpwwwtgendernettawamaresolutionspdf on the efficacy and necessity of transition as appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria and call for an end to insurance companies categorically excluding transitionrelated care from coverage here is a similar policy statement from the are the guidelines from the american academy of pediatrics is a similar resolution from the american academy of family physicians is one from the national association of social workers are the treatment guidelines from the royal college of psychiatrists and are guidelines from the nhs more from the nhs httpwwwnhsukconditionsgenderdysphoriapagestreatmentaspx
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at years old id say she knows herself better than you do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,an elderly woman is finally getting the life and the medical treatment she has needed since she was a child its sad it took so long for this to be possible for her but its uplifting to know she can finally do so now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive known i was transgender since i was years old i knew a girl called patricia and i decided i wanted to be known by that name but it didnt stick davies told caters news agency davies kept her identity a secret for most of her life for fear she would be shunned by her peers or forced to undergo electric shock treatment seems like after years of hiding who she is out of fear she was finally able to be accepted as herself how is that not uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not sure if its because the person is a wwii vet or because this person is yrs old or because this person is transgender
UpliftingNews,not_removed,look at that smile and have some humanity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you obviously dont want them to find peace since you insist on using hate based genetic purity arguments against her in spite of the fact that she is now hormonally female trans people will never be cis nontransgender but she is still she just call her the right pronoun whats it to you only genetically pure men and women are real men and women is that it because of those are the types of aryan arguments youre into i can make some recommendations they wear these lovely pointy white hats acctually
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or at any age
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except we know youre lying you have an agenda obviously you are ridiculing something you are afraid might be you go girl
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bahahaha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except shes known she was a woman most of her entire life and consciously hid that for her own safety
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why has this been disliked so much dont you guys understand what a joke is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uvvsj is officially awarded the go fuck yourself medal for people who like to kick puppies and belittle war veterans
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean if this isnt the true sign of acceptance and equality i dont know what is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpwwwlimblengtheningcom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not how gender works
UpliftingNews,not_removed,downvote you dont think the title is oniony
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always find it funny how hard yall try to be offensive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same the transphobia in all these comments is terrifying and unsurprising the atmosphere was not safe people did not understand what transgender was davies said its not percent safe now but its much better than it was people that i have told seem to be very accommodating and havent thrown abuse at me she said im glad her friends and community are more supportive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its heartbreaking to hear these stories of closeted gay men who get married and have kids and this poor woman had to wait her entire life as a man to finally come out again uplifting news makes me feel bummed out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,excecpt childeren
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about when their teens they still struggle to know who they are at that age
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get the fuck outta here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont be an asshole
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh man youre gonna lose so many points rip
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get the fuck outta here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get the fuck outta here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get the fuck outta here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just recognize that changing a pronoun relates to social norms and not anything scientific people with ovaries are referred to as she is not rooted in science you can be as offensive as you like to trans people or invalidating or whatever you want to call it thats your choice but dont act like it comes from an appeal to some great worldly truth or we will have issues
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people who disparage total strangers on the internet need mental help ftfy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aww shit you gonna get attacked now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get the fuck outta here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your feelings and bias also wont change reality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive had depression since i was years old and im years now i wouldnt listen to anyone saying its just a phase thats just ignorance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well to be fair the average episode of depression lasts about months so you could say thats it is a phase for a lot of people but that doesnt mean that people be dismissive of it especially when it seems to be chronic like in your case
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because after all of these years she is finally free to live out life that she deserves to live without fear of repercussions its healthy to be happy for people and sometimes its nice to give a fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great question look at it like this all pursuits of equality begin in controversy because you can easily see there are both negative and positive comments on this thread you see were still in the controversial stage of this type of equality there was once news that someone was gay or a black man was in love with a white woman and that was controversial at one time unfortunately still is some places watching this beautiful human being blossom amidst both positive and negative feedback is humbling to watch because if theres one thing that weve demonstrated as humans is that we grow toward equality and acceptance even if it takes awhile or a step back every now and again people who were gay woman not white and many others are now recognized more equal than any other time but werent always then as now people were dicks or just didnt see why it was important for these people to voice out the big message here is what side of the aisle do you want to be remembered on someone that welcomed change and progression toward equality or someone that stood in the way of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she is a woman who was never able to be recognized as such before finally getting the chance at the end of her life its sad it took this long but its uplifting that she gets to have this new lease on life now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its uplifting to people who live in fear of gender discrimination its uplifting to people who care about transgender rights and other transgender people this should be obvious its amazing you need people to break it down for you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone who had to hide who they were for years finally got to be who she felt she was her whole life years is a long time good for her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,based upon your user comments you clearly do not identify as transgender or even understand what that word means
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is so true its crazy how some people revere great people in history like mlk jr that helped fight for equality then just ignore certain human rights today when it comes to human rights in hindsight it seems like theres always a pretty clear cut good side and bad side unlike other aspects of history just crazy that it seems like people want to choose to be on the bad side for no reason other than they dont like change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this i call them transtrenders its actually pretty harmful in my opinion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are completely unrelated gender identity has nothing to do with sexuality you can be gay or straight trans or cis as far as describing how it feels thats very difficult to do especially for someone whos never experienced it its very lonely and isolating for a lot of us we always know something is wrong but we cant put it into words saying being in the wrong body isnt totally accurate its more complicated than that its like having a craving for a certain flavor of ice cream but having never tried ice cream before some of us never knew ice cream even existed until recently i dont think im helping
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay i dont know what thats suppose to mean
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a medical condition that is diagnosed at a very young age if im not mistaken if you come out as a woman later in life youre pursuing a lifestyle and i really prefer not to pm but thanks for being extremely civil in your comment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what are you talking about i can not understand something that does not make me a biggot just stating a fact ive never met or even talk to someone who is transgender i think you took offense at i said i dont understand it i was referring to being transgender if she wants to be referred to as a she hell i have no problem with that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cletus lmao boy you american leftists really hate your rural working class sadly for you im an upper class european
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gender dysphoria is different than being transgender most trans people havent been diagnosed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what thats fine if you have the desire to be opposite sex that you physically are that doesnt mean you arent deluded and if you go a step further with surgery then that is mutilationthose words may sound harsh but they are accurate all because i state the facts and not be super pc about it doesnt mean i cant treat trans people like human beings especially at work and yes transgenderism is super glorified nowadays and its kinda weird do what you want just dont go parading it around like yall are heroes transgender people should still have the basic rights of human beings and nobody is debating that if you think im bitter thats fine but i dont hate you or trans people i just think this whole movement is overexposed and idolized and im calling bs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most people hate what they fear and this fear is usually based in ignorance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks i always wanted to die in my prime
UpliftingNews,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but would it be wrong to assume that your background introduces a teeny weeny tiny little bit of bias
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its pure narcissism that makes you deny them simply happiness because you require that the world fits into your sexual comfort zone no its a free speech issue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they exist so whats your point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not hypocritical at all all im saying that theres a problem nowadays wherein transgender people feel like theyve the right to bully people who use factual arguments against transgenderism case in point was when zoey tur grabed ben shapiro by the neck on live tv and threatened to send him home in an ambulance for asking tur about hisher biology its not about me tolerating them as ive said in my comment i wish all the best for the vet theres a subculture within lgbt communities which doesnt take kindly to arguments backed by facts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay why is it ironic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you i appreciate it you can only convince people with a well worded argument not by rambling and trolling
UpliftingNews,not_removed,underrated comment of the day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is it uplifting that someone has lived their entire life knowing theyre not who they feel they are years before telling anyone that youve been living a lie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nobody in the world seriously thinks this guy is a woman but were all pretending
UpliftingNews,not_removed,months max and youre going to get busted for blowing the pool boy at a stop n shop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we understand perfectly this is not the appropriate place for jokes like this there are plenty of subs where trans phobic humor disguised as off color jokes at the expense of seniors is seen as acceptable this is not one of them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he
UpliftingNews,not_removed,xhe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think you get what the onion is doing haha this person is trans is not the kind of biting satire theyre known for being trans isnt a punchline
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont understand how deep the politics is here at reddit and why people are going to voat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry i exercise my constitutional rights its one of the perks of being an american citizen also which i am proud to be i also find it funny how yall try to get a rise out of us not happening this time sunshine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i find myself having a hard time thinking these are good things while i dont necessarily agree with i would never stop someone who truly believes in their heart of hearts that they are a woman in side a mans body or vice versa but at the same i think there is some truth in their being some mental instability involved in transgender people i know there have been studies on brain activity and such in transgender people but apart of me also sees it as an act of escapism i know there is more to it but i dont think ill ever accept it as normal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never got the phrases homophobia or transphobia really who is afraid of transvestites or gays peoole dont see a tranny and roll over and cry like an arachnophobe would when seeing a spider
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because childrens feelings are invalidated by the fact they are a child stupid children thinkin they know shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i meant it in broad terms no matter what youre going through in your life at any age you should do what makes you happy not just because youre old
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck that sucks my tip do regular exercise min every day eat healthy greens and no sugar do things that are productive and nonproductive diagnosed by a professional
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you telling me im not allowed to identify as transgender fuck off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont feed the obvious troll
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe it can be better understood as having something in your body that you cant change but feel is wrong for example a guy who hates having a beard but can buy no razors every day the beard grows bigger and scruffier and the guy just wants to shave because it feels so wrong not because beards are bad but because he doesnt want beards on himself it grows longer his moustache heavy on his lips and he just wants to rip his beard off because its wrong that face is not how his face should be maybe its not such a good metaphor just my experience with beards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are implying that only genetically pure men and women are real men and women are you not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are very much mistaken you can come out at any age a medical condition treated later in life is still just as valid as one treated earlier just these people usually have a more difficult road ahead since it was not caught earlier thank you for being civil as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,truth is you are one of many individuals who doesnt have exposure to the topic simple lack of exposure and knowledge on something often appears to others to be willful bias so that you know transgender people are those who wish to fully be recognized as members of the gender contrary to the sex they were born into so to change the pronoun used from what you would had they not been transgender is not the standard practice i am transgender and i just want to say i dont fault you for using the wrong pronoun here when people do it deliberately it is pretty hurtful to trans people who put it in a lot of effort and pain to be seen a certain way and this is what you were perceived as doing by that other poster it seems like you are a kind person who wants to be understanding and everyone should try to practice the ideal of being patient and explaining something before reacting badly to someone who isnt informed on the topic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most of my friends are rural working class acctually cletus is more of a state of mind than a specific location
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you need a diagnosis to receive medical treatment which is what the term transitioning refers to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean can you actually demonstrate the existence of a delusion feel free to look up the definition of the word if you need to i mean it in the most literal way possible being pc has nothing to do with facts so its not my concern either when it comes to being correct your attitude more or less is fine with me you cant make someone love you but tolerance especially in places like a shared work setting is the basis of a functioning society anyway as far as glory well you may see it that way but the glory of the media and stuff exists because its in pretty stark contrast to the way were often treated you may think were parading like heroes but the truth is we spend a lot of time scared possibly even hiding like cowards youre free to have the sentiments you like but because this is where facts come into it ill reiterate for you to call it delusional you need to demonstrate a disconnect between reality and my thoughts i resolutely think that you will not be able to do so and i invite you to try
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when you say this is not an attack on transgendered people after own your masculinity be a fucking man wat edit then changed to after
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant be transphobic because i know a transgendered person im not racist i have a black friend fuck your antiquated ideas about what makes a man a man or what makes a woman a woman for that matter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hate to break it to you but you are in fact a transphobe getouttahea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,be a fucking man cant you see she tried that for years this isnt an assault on masculinity she just wasnt a man now she finally gets to be herself for however long she has left
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ohhhhi was on your side at first i thought you meant it was depressing that he had to pretend for so long i wish you could see how much your way of thinking hurts some people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the reason for your speech is what im questioning not the fact that youre choosing to use it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you were saying it was hypocritical but they are two different things hating nazis is okay hating all germans aint
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was studying irony in english class today and wanted to call something ironic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it would be far more convincing if you didnt have several incorrect assumptions stated as fact in your argument
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also their appeals to biology and reality basically come from a place that says entirely that transgender people have a delusion thats not a logical argument transgender people dont believe that we magically transform from treatment we are applying medical technology to achieve desired results in what way practiced biology is denying biology its like claiming that undergoing heart surgery means you dont understand the reality of heart issues
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a phobia is a fear not a hatred stop calling it transphobia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or you know science
UpliftingNews,not_removed,medical science is not perfect but when comparing opinions regarding the efficacy and necessity of a medical treatment option every major medical authority carries a hell of a lot more weight than some guy on the internet pulling shit out of his ass there is no real medical controversy here transition works it is vitally necessary anf frequent life saving medical care
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shes known for years how can you just dismiss that as crazy telling off trans teenagers i kinda get i still think its heinous but whatever but you cant even be bothered to respect a world war ii vets wishes for how they spend their final years and you think shes mentally ill you got problems
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its tragic she had to wait so long its uplifting that she doesnt have to do so anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck off you pathetic incel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,her you unpleasant human
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people are going to do whatever makes them happy regardless of whether you think they should or not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are hormonally female after treatment which does show they are biological women after treatment theyll just never be cis nontrans theyre still women though its just a matter if you seek to use a hate based genetic purity argument against them they know theyre a little different but just call them the right thing whats it to you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to some one that because they think that them being trans is not so uplifting that they are secretly raging homos wut speak english
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not really care thats clear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,buzzkill you must be fun at parties
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i get what the onion does but i also get what rnottheonion does sorry i still think the title sounds oniony but since its true it belongs in nottheonion sub
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you may not grasp this but im also exercising my constitutional rights you have just as much a right to be an asshole as someone else does to call you one it goes both ways sweety nice try
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry i exercise my constitutional rights nobody is trying to prosecute you rofl the representation of offensive gestures as being a constitutionality issue is really a marvel of social engineering
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i used to think that until i started testosterone replacement therapy im finally the man i knew i was in my mind but couldnt be because of my lame ass little balls just half a milliliter of oil a week and im me for the first time in years if i was more of a man in my head than my body would allow then why cant a man be a woman in his mind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just a few thoughts on your post i think there is some truth in their being some mental instability involved in transgender people have you considered how mentally difficult it is for trans people to cope with societies expectations and requirements let alone regularly suffering verbal and physical assault in society but apart of me also sees it as an act of escapism its worth noting that the medical profession employs specialists in their field to assess people who have gender dysphoria and address people who are experiencing escapism as you say in the community they are known as gatekeepers have a nice day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,phobia and philia are not used as completely literal translations theyre just suffixes that describe the intent of a word hemophilia translates to blood love but it means that a person has trouble clotting their blood homophobic is a sociological term not really a psychologicalmedical term it is defined as dislike of or prejudice against homosexual people though if these bathroom bills mean anything to me its that some people really are afraid of transgay people due to their prejudice or are prejudiced due to their fear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think there are a good amount of people who fear them as a concept ie the homosexual agenda seeks to corrupt americas children they then take this fear out on individuals as anger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just in case you were interested in it you are using two outdated slurs that are rather rude and shouldnt be used
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awwww you poor thing blows kiss
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean there is a value to putting an age gate for gender reassignment its a permanent or at least semipermanent procedure that needs mature consideration ive got no problem with children being transgender they just need to gain maturity before they take such a big step
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what if what makes us all happy as individuals is bad for our society and civilization in the long run
UpliftingNews,not_removed,chill out dude im not taking sides no need to be a dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre on the wrong side of history
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a cultural question not a scientific one it ignores the nuanced reality first and foremost of people who are biologically ambiguous or inbetween sexes for starters but it goes further as a statement that is more political than pragmatic when you decide that cultural factors around gender are nonexistent you can make this claim of sex you can say that im a gay man with boobs and low muscle mass every cell of his body running on estrogen but at a point the usefulness of that approach becomes questionable in light of its stark politicization semantics are semantics but if youre willing to claim that every trans person should avoid being classified as the gender to which theyve transitioned id say youre actually making the situation more confusing than simply referring to people by how they present and like to be treated i dont believe that your approach is justifiable by appeals to reason as it essentially boils down only to feelings your feelings on gender do not dictate reality for the billions of other people in this world if youre resolute on considering gender and sex to be identical youre welcome to do that but the net effect is limiting the usefulness of language
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive been diagnosed many times and ive almost come out of it as well but those relapses will get you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretending to be something youre not takes a huge mental toll especially when you have to do it for so long it may not make any difference to you or me but for her its the biggest possible weight off her shoulders i would equate it to being able to relax for the first time in her life at edit word
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why the actual fuck do you think an elderly veterans genitals are your business
UpliftingNews,not_removed,found your spank bank
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no hiding in this situation means she identified as a female not a male as she was born she had to spend her life denying this as people back then were unaware of the science behind it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im telling you that you are making a poor attempt to mock people who are actually transgender
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant help it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,see right here is a person i would love to be friends with understood i was not trying to be rude just uninformed all of us should put our differences aside get to know people a lot of people are not exposed to things therefore tend to easily judge just let others live we only have limited time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,serious question that im probably going to get flamed for i use he and she to refer to people as what they are genetically i use their names usually masculine or feminine to refer to who they or their parents if youve changed your name or accepted the one your parents have you think they are i really dont care if you want to dress more feminine or more masculine i wouldnt personally take drugs to grow a beard but i respect your right to do whatever you want to your body anywhere on the scale all the way from piercing your ears to that thing where guys mutilate their dick to cut it in half like a hot dog what i dont understand is why im supposed to pretend that someone suddenly isnt xx or xy or xxx or xxy or xyywhy is this seen as a problem on my part rather than a problem with society not allowing you to do whatever you want and a problem with an individual or group of people that want to be recognized as a different genetic makeup than what they are if i dye my hair blonde because thats who i want to be and im not happy with it being black im not going to flip out when my drivers license still says black hair im not going to expect everyone to treat me like im a natural blonde its just part of my body we are who we are and i truly do not understand why i should pretend that someone isnt something that they are just because it makes them uncomfortable every time ive tried to ask about this it gets turned around as a youre the one thats uncomfortable and taking it out on others and i suppose in a way thats trueit makes me very uncomfortable to use language in any way other than accurately it feels like lying and im not going to play make believe for extended periods of time because someone else cant come to grips with reality tldr i dont care if you want to identify as a giraffe or a volcano or a girl or a boy or whatever else you do you live and love however you want i genuinely dngafbut why am i being imposed on to play along if i disagree with your categorization of yourself its fucking science
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can you explain why saying im not racist i have a black friend isnt a valid argument if im as racist as people say i am and i want to lynch blacks i would not in fact associate myself with blacks let alone befriend them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont understand what you mean can you clarify
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont have to patronize me to prove your point my man it just makes you seem immature its ironic because hes making this moral high ground claim about hypocrites forcing their world view on him while he is forcing his world view on this transgender woman and the people that support her ironic because hes doing exactly what he says others shouldnt while he complains about hypocrites
UpliftingNews,not_removed,news flash thats not how words work ill hand off to this response english is a democratic language and in this language the inexorable pull of fad and history shift the language ever so slowly rather quickly before literacy crossed into the majority but that story for another time so while yes being slavish to the greek word phobia which means overwhelming fear would mean that if this were a purely clinical thing wed be stuck but since the phrase homophobia is about as fuckedup a mutant hybrid of a word since toyotathon and cheeseburger we dont really need to worry too much about that do you say a napron no you say an apron because some dumbfuck decided to rebracket the damned thing and move the n across the gap prolly the same guy i bet it was a guy men amirite ladies who changed a noumpere to an umpire thats engrish for you so in this case homosexual is a greeklatin combomeal that means one whose sexually attracted to the same kind and phobia which is greek for overwhelming fear of since weve dropped the sexual homophobia best as i can fucking tell expletive infixation ftw means overwhelming fear of ones own kind so if you hate yourself im looking at you jews then youre a homophobe but no thats not how english works we are all frankenstein and this language is our monster or is it the human centipede of languages dibs the middle segment its cobbled together by random parts harvested from dead bodies of other languages and frequently taken from the living while theyre left in an iced tub with a note around their neck telling them weve borrowed a kidney thats what we do in contemporary english homophobia means any kind of prejudice against gays if the person you talk to goes all poindexter on you theyre being needlessly idiotic nothing in english makes any sense in light of original word meanings thats not how this works thats not how any of this works remember in english all that matters is context clarity convention when i say homophobia you know precisely what the fuck im talking about and if you pretend not to then thats your depressed iq not mine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,look at all this wellreasoned defense of trans people on reddit im eating it up did you know its also international trans day of visibility anywhere on earth where its currently the
UpliftingNews,not_removed,posts ooooh i touched a nerve the only reason anybody would be shutting dismissive about this completely harmless and very uplifting story is if he was harbouring a secret i dont think theres anything wrong with being gay but theres a lot wrong with being secretly gay and outwardly transphobic you should just come out your life will be much better just because you blow a pool boy doesnt mean you have to have a pool you could blow a mechanic and not own a car
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where on earth did i say you couldnt do that all i said was i have a right to be an asshole never did i say you didnt have a right to call me out appreciate it if you would stop trying to a get a rise out of me its quite annoying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude and when i started estrogen i thought hmmm i wonder how ill feel from this id wanted to do it like my whole life and while i knew and hoped it wouldnt change me as a person the most amazing thing happened and i feel like i am just so much more present in the world the constant voice in my head that drew a boundary between myself and reality seems to have vanished basically i dont know how much sense that makes to anyone reading who cant relate i question also how much it may be biological or social in origin but the truth is that there isnt any cure for it and the biggest harms in transition definitely seem to be adverse reactions by others congratulations on your transition and im glad to hear its treating you well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in my comment i fully agreed with this i just point out that i will probably never see it as a normal thing i find it fine i just dont like it personally im someone who trys to not let bias thoughts or racist thoughts change the objective truth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all i pointed out was the fact that there a quite a few transgender who made the wrong choice or regret it i never said dont do it i inferred that it should be something that you think about heavily on your point of the stigma of course there is but im not apart of it why is it that if i disagree with something im inherently setting it back whether i like it or not shouldnt affect the way the person in question feels its important to note i dont hate these people or think less of them i am not attacking transgender people im just writing what i feel about the subject
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this makes sense i worded what i was trying to say very badly i was in class at the time i think these words are thrown around too much to people who dont fear gays or trans another word would be nice as a midrange for lack of a better term
UpliftingNews,not_removed,since when couldnt we call gays gays even gays consider themselves gays so i cant see where you are getting the idea that gay is a slur as with transvestite its a medical term that is still used in the medical field to describe a trans person i cant see how any of these are rude fag is a slur gay is not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know i used to have similar thoughts and i say that because i think its a reasonable thought to have and am not trying to be critical but then i saw an interview oni think it was either abc or nbc and the newscaster makes that point that at do they really have the ability to make such a significant decision like that and the therapist who specializes in helping kids who feel like theyre trans just responded well they make the decision to kill themselves at and you know what if letting kids make that decision is going to make them happier then that is for them and hopefully supportive parents to work out because damn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean there is a value to putting an age gate for gender reassignment its a permanent or at least semipermanent procedure that needs mature consideration the typical approach for those who believe that transition may be desirable in people prior to pubescent age is to administer medications which halt the effects of puberty temporarily this is reversible by ceasing administration of such treatment and the result will be a delayed but very similar puberty otherwise i do actually really question whether someone at say years old is that immature on the simple topic of this is how id like my body to be of course we dont know the career that wed like to have at that age but we have a lot to learn about the world we do have a pretty good understanding of what a man is and what a woman is by then and in the case of incorrect choices most of it is quite reversible and ultimately having a choice at all is a privilege over the biological paradigm of simply being given a gender to then attempt to embrace i dont fully endorse administering such treatments to children but this is the argument id make for it im also not really opposed to it for whatever its worth though when yearold me thought that hormone treatment sounded like a good option it was ultimately the very same decision id make another years later
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure compromise is required in society i think a lot of people are unwilling to compromise and thats why we have a lot of the problems we are faced with today
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats the problem with simple minded people they jump to anger instead of rational thinking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not a cultural question youre spewing bullshit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish i could upvote you more thanks for understanding the struggle and how truly stressful it is it seems like no one does
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how was he pretending if he had all the parts a male should have thats not pretending at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who cares that theyre a veteran its completely irrelevant in this discussion unless youre a hermaphrodite then youre a dude if youre packing a dick and a woman if you have a vagina you cant argue with science but i know youll try
UpliftingNews,not_removed,arrogance sometimes can not be breached there is hate in that posters heart wishing suffering on others because you are confused is unfortunate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i actually identify as transgender please do not tell me how to identify myself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well cool then youre a white supremacist murdered any jews lately
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well hey while were here feel free to ask if you have any other questions on the topic you do seem like a lovely person and i wish you the best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean i have no interest in being belligerent over a difference in opinions but to answer to the best of my ability in the little time i can afford at the moment my response would primarily be to ask you why chromosomal configuration to you is the seat of gendered being id want to critique also your notion of linguistic purity language is always fluid and well the idea that genomics and pronouns are a natural pairing is pretty new and feels to me a bit contrived i dont disagree with your belief that an individual should be able to present in any sort of way without it being required that they change the pronouns they request to be called but as one example are you familiar with androgen insensitivity syndrome these are xy individuals who do not experience any or some of the typical effect of masculinizing hormones these individuals often have an outward appearance of being entirely biologically female but according to your proposed outlook it would be more accurate to reform to them as men and use the pronoun he to compare hair color to gender is you know a pretty false equivalency and kind of disingenuous i understand your point but the truth is that gender very much permeates every aspect of human characterization for better or for worse and as you acknowledge gender dysphoric individuals do typically modify their physical form if attempting to treat said dysphoria but the social is a great part of this and for someone to truly experience dysphoria ie a bornfemale wishing to be a man it shouldnt be hard to imagine why it would be hurtful when they make their best effort to look masculine and to exist as a man in the world whatever that may entail to be told well you arent what you want to be and you never will be as far as science well pronouns arent science thats a fact language isnt actually scientific either if a trans woman were to tell you i was born female and i do not have the genotype xy despite this being untrue then science is perhaps being done a disservice but trans people do recognize that we are not naturally the way we wish to be your views on the ideal use of gendered language and what it should refer to are not wrong though i disagree with them but the truth is that they are not any more right than any others either you can surely believe that people with a certain genotype or genital configuration etc should be referred to necessarily using only certain types of language but i would just contend that this approach is not founded in science or a proper appeal to proper language i dont expect that ive changed your mind but i hope that you are able to see some reason in this comment and that perhaps it may soften your stance on the idea of right or wrong use of pronouns and other gendered terms we disagree but i dont intend to disparage so if youd like clarification or have anything ive said that you think is wrong im glad to continue the conversation just if you could do me a favor dont say its science its language or its proper without addressing what ive said in response i simply ask this because this is a pretty common practice in discussions like this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,serious question that im probably going to get flamed for i use he and she to refer to people as what they are genetically wow must really slow things down if you have to do a dna test on people before you can refer to them as he or she
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a buzzword to you because your head is too far buried in your own ignorance to understand that it is in fact a thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre free to spout all the hateful bullshit you want but at the end of the day your opinion has no real world relevance transgenderism doesnt effect you youre getting upset because you dont like thinking about transgenderism because it makes you uncomfortable it in no way effects your life and much more qualified people than you have identified it as a psychological disorder what you have are opinions on how people dress and identify but really you have not given any reason to why people shouldnt do it except your inaccurate assertion that theyll regret it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes not forcing his world view on anyone simply saying that he wont limit his speech at the demands of another
UpliftingNews,not_removed,having a different opinion than others and discussing it on a public forum isnt forcing anything on anyone you can agree or disagree its up to you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,chromosomes are irrelevant they arent even blueprints theyre more like vague project outlines for how to build a human a hell of a lot of things can cause development to go offscript hell have you ever had yours tested if not its rare but entirely possible you dont have the ones you think you do is xy and so his her daughter are they biologically male became a father despite being predominantly xx a fact he only discovered at the age of is he biologically female to define sex as male xy and female xx is a bit like defining our species as humans chromosomes while typically true it would be entirely inaccurate and wildly offensive to declare that therefor anyone who doesnt have exactly chromosomes is not biologically human
UpliftingNews,not_removed,according to what exactly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gender is a social construct honey
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how about you try not being a dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this isnt jeopardy you dont have to phrase it like a question also why so angry you seem a little insecure about this whole gender identity thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,her and maybe consider changing your views when presented with evidence to the contrary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wonderful you must be fun at parties
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trans women are hormonally and biologically female after treatment its just a matter if you seek to use a hate based genetic purity argument against such people no further reply is needed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry i exercise my constitutional rights where did i mention anything about your freedom of speech where did i say you didnt have the right i didnt but if youre going to try to use it as a defense you should know that it doesnt work because both of us are using our freedom of speech
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats awesome and yeah i can relate i didnt transition as in female to male i am a man i just had underproducing balls now im a pit bull of a human stronger more aggressive more passionate its awesome men with high natural testosterone dont know how lucky they are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but that is what you are doing your own personal bias against not liking trans people is going against the objective truth science is objective and does not believe that a trans person is mentally ill but your bias does
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trans regret is super rare though its like of all trans people people tend to prop up these examples to try and discredit trans people in general not saying thats what youre doing now but it is the reason youre getting some push back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,first of all transvestite only refers to someone who likes to dress in the clothes of the opposite gender and is not necessarily the same as transgender which is an actual medical term second of all tranny is absolutely a slur
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the things youre saying are why httpwwwavporgstoragedocumentsncavptranshvfactsheetpdf not to mention all the social rejection httpwilliamsinstitutelawuclaeduresearchsuicideattemptsamongtransgenderandgendernonconformingadults shes a fucking human and deserves to be treated as such if anyone out there is dealing with this or something similar the httpwwwtranslifelineorg is and httpwwwthetrevorprojectorg for those in the lgbtq space is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who hurt you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i get you on that i see no problem with hormone replacement as it is largely reversible and can be extremely helpful in helping a transgender person fit their identity i was speaking specifically of gender reassignment surgery which i am also aware is not something all transgender people opt for anyways i was just making the point that gender reassignment is highly intensive surgery from a medical standpoint so it should be undertaken carefully and maturely because it can be a massive ordeal to reverse an ordeal that while not massively risky still expands the probability that something could go wrong if there were no such risks i would see no reason to object
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is a uhh really poor argument what we call something ie the practice of applied linguistics is certainly a question of culture and what say you to the various known cultural systems throughout the world which had or have conceptions of thirdgender roles i understand your point in a society in which we strive for gender equality the distinctions between genders and the following necessity to change gender conception of an individual is diminished in comparison to traditional cultures where more rigid gender roles are in place but still im not sure how your argument is an appeal to reason rather than base ideals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,assuming youre male if your mind was put into a female body right now would you just fully accept it youd still feel male but youd have all the parts a female does right now imagine becoming a social outcast if people knew your problem youd probably pretend to feel female some people just feel that way in the bodies they were born with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what exactly do you think science even means here we have no idea whether she has had reconstructive surgery or not and regardless of whether she has her existence as a woman remains
UpliftingNews,not_removed,intersex people ≠ hermaphrodites exist you cant argue with science but i know youll try
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you do not understand what biological sex is you do not understand what gender is you do not understand what science is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not how science works
UpliftingNews,not_removed,identify is actually linguistically a poor term to define the trans experience in my opinion to identify is to call something by a name so you are literally identifying yourself as transgender if you want to go further and say youre a gender dysphoric individual who is transitioning thats really not the same and were all pretty sure it would be a lie if you said that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not telling you how to do anything im calling you a liar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i bombed them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i do have questions im on my way to fanexpo in dallas hey keep your chin up be you dont show hate to others do what youre doing inform you will never change someones mind by being rude or condescending but by love and respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is an amazing reply
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or you know just look at them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hateful bullshit i just said it was a free speech issue the idea of transgenderism itself yeah i dont care about it if its a man with a penis im entitled to call him a man explain to me why its hateful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and hell be rightfully called a jerk because we have free speech we can call him a jerk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wouldnt say chromosomes are irrelevant they are one of five things that make up biological sex chromosomes external genitalia internal genitalia hormones secondary sexual characteristics gender identity and gender expression are functions of biological sex but also a functions of social roles as well as cognitive and emotional factors
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that would imply he has a social life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,see what youre doing youre mocking trans people by pretending be something you think is even more outrageousdelicious youre being an asshole what possible motivation could result in this you might not like death metal but you dont get your knickers in a twist about that no youre motivated go ahead report me to the mods just think of how shitty youre being about someones struggle when youre lying awake at night frantically masturbating to carlos and if you really identify as a horse i encourage you to be yourself be public about it take the risk so others down the line dont have to but you wont youre a coward
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stop bullying and trying to make me feel bad about my gender lesson sexual orientation is not the same as gender identity they were calling you gay not attacking your gender identity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then the context of our use is different but either way its a testament to the way that having hormones that are right for us can make a world of difference even though i ran my body for many years with the testosterone you wanted now that im on estrogen i am physically weaker but i feel stronger more aggressive more passionate etc in the sense that i just feel generally more alive in all the right ways also a bit pull of a human i love that congratulations again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mental illness is a matter of subjectivity in my opinion we can call it illness or not but it doesnt change the fact that transition is the best thing for us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not how liking something works i dont like broccoli but im not going to stop people from eating it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tranny is slang what people dont realize is no word has weight to it you make something a slur by getting offended by it take honkey for example a white slur that anyone can say freely because we havent put any weight to it i used the word tranny with no intent other than to shorten the word transgender or transvestite and what you said about transvestite is true i actually had no idea that it meant people that dress in the opposition sexs clothes but whats the difference every cell in hisher body is male and heshe dresses in other sexes clothing i get there is a definition difference but is there really a technical difference
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hahaha true though well its typically required that someone undergoes years of hormone replacement before even undergoing such a surgery and its quite unlikely to be something any children would undergo except maybe in the most extreme of cases i mean i dont think one can reverse genital surgery very well but typically anyone undergoing that would be pretty damn sure of it and i suppose that regret is a possibility but then no medical treatment has efficacy and the worstcase result is someone with fucked up genitals its unfortunate but the truth is a lot of people have fucked up genitals by circumstance of birth we should very much try to prevent people from making the decision willynilly oh jeez is that a pun but i think the reality is that well find from such procedures even at increasingly young ages ever greater efficacy that far outstrips the harms done by them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre using a lot of words to cover that you dont actually have an argument regardless of the terrible things youve done to your bodys hormone balance you have the genotype of a man in the absence of medical intervention you would be physiologically a man its not some cultural dilemma its a mental instability you can try and make some cultural play and call yourselves whatever you want but it doesnt change reality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great explanation most cis people that try to understand transgenders and transexuals try to do so from the gender theyre assigned a man would try to understand what its like to want to be a woman this is a better explanation because at its root this is the life of transgender people theyre not men that want to be women theyve been women all their lives but their body does not match
UpliftingNews,not_removed,prove im lying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well see thats just classy right after you slept with your sister right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ty youre amazing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre also entitled to call someone with schizophrenia a schizo or someone with autism a retard but its rude as fuck so you typically dont do it and society has rightfully stigmatized it i just want society to rightfully stigmatize people who after finding out someone is trans continues to intentionally misgender them the same way that someone who calls people with autism or downs syndrome retards or gays faggots at that point you arent doing it for any reason other than to be a twat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes i would be a jerk but thats the world we live in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre the one that cant actually back up the claim and you keep calling people names you really should calm down a little and think
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how you arent actually saying anything just repeating mental illness over and over again isnt actually making a point you however are evading my point why are you acting so insecure about this gender identity stuff does it hit too close to home does it make you uncomfortable to think about something like that making people happy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,deleted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so you are using transphobic slurs then and are a rude fuck i guess nigger cracker bitch slut cocksucker etc are not slurs if you just dont get offended by them you are an ignorant jerk possing as a pseudointellectual
UpliftingNews,not_removed,veterans as a whole have over twice the suicide rates of the general public abusing an elderly veteran is really fucking low
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i think a lot of that is also due to doctors getting a lot better at performing them now that it is a bit more common you have surgeons who have experience with gender reassignment which is great for improving outcomes and patient satisfaction oh by the way i think that the surgery is now somewhat reversible just that most doctors dont have the expertise because as you said few decide to go back because most of the organs are still intact just reareanged it is possible to reverse its just a much more difficult surgery with relatively high risk of complications i think its only been performed a few times ie when a child has been hermaphroditic the parents chose one sex and the child grows up and chooses the other cant remember the case study but there was at least one instance of this where the surgery went mostly fine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets address reality then rather than your incessant focus on semantics eh what am i claiming myself to be that is bending reality am i genotypically male indeed would i have gynoid secondary sex characteristics without the use of exogenous hormones indeed no tell me where the distortion of reality comes into it i can wait a long time trans people recognize what we are we recognize that it is medical science that allows us to achieve a body that is more consistent with the way wed prefer to look and feel of course social factors are huge as well before the advent of endocrinology gendervariant people still existed and the knowledge that it is the testes that cause masculinization is ancient orchiectomy is a procedure that may outdate recorded history ill inform you that im quite mentally sound i lived quite well as a man and im now living quite well in the role of a woman better in fact because im now existing socially and physically in a way that ive always found much more desirable its likely that intrauterine hormone levels play a part in this i will repeat for you now my original statement so that you dont ignore it to claim that im using words to hide behind or something like that this is how i speak sorry my students appreciate it anyway there is no distortion of reality in understanding how our bodies work and manipulating them through medical technology to remove a tumor from the brain is not to be in denial of reality nor is applying hormonal treatments denying reality its possible that for you reality serves as some appeal to fatalism but to act like delusion is ever or has ever been a factor here is patently and demonstrably horseshit i can not make you rescind your biases nor your beliefs but i can surely point out that they are not founded in an appeal to logic any questions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean if it looks feels and functions like a vagina it is one regardless of whether she was born with it its not like there arent instances of cis woman needing genital reconstruction youre missing the point though the concept of transgender people means that what biological sex youre born with doesnt determine your gender it correlates most of the time but its not the only thing that matters gender is mental how you identify and her having a penis or not idk doesnt make her less of a woman if she knows and has for a long time that she is one my advice is dont sweat over things that dont affect you its okay if you dont get it you dont have to understand just respect pronouns and acknowledge that this has been really difficult for her and she can finally relax and be happy with herself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you failed to answer the question though what do you think science means after all actual science says you are wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im reporting you right now in fact mockery should at least be clever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont need to its obvious anyone who reads this thread will understand that the proof is in your comment history
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jokes on you im not white or have a sister hah biaatch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,such a pure conversation brings a tear to my eye
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly id never call a gay person a faggot or a transgender person a tranny as an insult or as a way of mocking or demeaning them words like nigger should be stigmatised but not erased like in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not about degrading people and making them feel unwanted in society its about facts and objective truth and the freedom to discuss these example i wouldnt call someone with a learning disability a retard because thats rude and like you said rightfully stigmatized however objectively they are mentally retarded and not alternatively abled as some extreme leftists might put it therefore i wouldnt call a transsexual a tranny and if he personally wants to make physical changes to his body or asks to be called something different who am i to force him to do otherwise its his life but the fact that he was born a man has male biology and will always be a man no matter what cosmetic changes he makes remains you are arguing with science also before you refute with the wrong gender argument please choose one of the following gender is a social construct you can be born the wrong gender
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not today
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honestly in some cases you could be onto something with that making people happy i am willing to admit that prior to the years in which i actively have considered myself trans i saw myself as someone who suffers from gender dysphoria and can beat it through sheer force of will and ideology that kind of turned me into a disdainful person for some time and i was quite transphobic later on that evolved to fullblown envy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never said i thought you were delicious stop projecting also im truly shaking to the core at your threat mr only discovered reddit days ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont worry eventually you will grasp a basic understanding of gender one day maybe probably not haha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im happy to educate trolls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ironic i saw a highly rated comment saying idiots result to swearing and name calling my point was that no word would become a slur if no one got offended by them a reason why cracker has no power to it whites arent offended but why nigger is a crazy nono because people are offended by it tranny isnt a slur it has always been a shorter version of transgender however now it seems its a slur because people like you are offended by words of all things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so you cant prove i dont identify as transgender
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh so youre one of the good ones huh how sad minority guy agreeing with the kkk about other minorities man they love people like you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the problem here is that you refuse to look at sources people provide you you refuse to educate yourself plain ignorance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know sadly i know it took me a long fucking time to accept myself i never hated on people on the internet under the guise of lol jk bro or whatever but i did judge people pretty harshly understanding all that doesnt make this not harmful to others though love your username btw
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one thats a pretty liberal use of the word science real science disagrees with this point two you are getting pretty emotional up in here calling people names being belligerent im just curious as to whats setting this off also i dont think its weird to call people by the gender they identify mostly because im not an asshole
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you do not understand slurs at all the nword is a slur because it was used to refer to enslaved africans there is a historically use that is extremely derogatory similarly transvestite and tranny have been historical derogatory terms used to insult and dehumanize trans people the fact that you feel so strongly that you need to use the words and direct them at trans people confirms they are a slur you are only using them to insult trans people and try to hurt them a slur is a term used in a derogatory manner to ridicule a person you could argue cracker is a slur but i wouldnt buy it since there isnt any real innuendo or pejorative meaning to it its just a made up term regardless i dont like the word because it has a degree or rudeness to it call me an idiot you are a rude transphobic jerk i hope someone hugs the hate out of your ugly heart one day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,clever the kids seem to look at it as a positive thing rather than something that theyre being forced to do and thats a huge part of the battle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gotta love that photo caption an example of a crossing guard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is what i love to see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i see a crossing guard at a nearby school often giving high fives and greeting the kids by name i thought that was cool when im old im gonna be a chill crossing guard like that great benefits and hours
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i did a doubletake on that one made me laugh seems a reporter was under a tight deadline and didnt have enough time to grab a pic of the actual crossing guard and went with genericd
UpliftingNews,not_removed,upliftingnews has to be one of the best subredditssites to look at when you feel like you need to read something positive dont you think
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for the most part i bet its a very gratifying job good for you inspyma
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i worked on a subsidized green cart program in nyc we learned that poor people wont even eat fruits and vegetables if they are free and include instructions on how to prepare it failed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and our roads are still crumbling thanks jerry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yay an answer to a problem that doesnt exist or is at least far down the list of real problems that the state faces well done democrats any money this is just another slush fund
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sadly this wouldnt help anything where i live everyone that has food stamps or lower income in general live off of chips soda and wouldnt even think twice about going to a farmers market the majority of those shoppers at the farmers markets are those who have a decent jobincome and care about their care about their health generally from what i see is that those who care about what they put in their body is at an all time low so why would they even go to the farmers market there usually arent any littlerascals either disclaimer this isnt based off anything more than my own experiences and obviously doesnt apply to everyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,expensive food is not the problem in california its expensive cost of living
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not to be a cynical jerk but that amounts sounds like a token gesture with a state the size of california and the amount of poverty california has mill sounds like its barely enough to subsidize one type of vegetable at a farmers market let alone a years worth of market shopping for a group that is larger than the population of several states
UpliftingNews,not_removed,farmers markets have been accepting ebc and wic for years in california i am glad that gov brown has continued the program its important for people to have fresh produce and farmers market produce is so fucking cheap compared to some of the grocery store chains plus its all in season and seasonal cooking is the most frugal and delicious cooking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets increase the tax burden more and watch that cost of living go down no wonder californians are fleeing like rats from a ship to nearby states
UpliftingNews,not_removed,itt everyone eats super healthy and cheap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this type of shit doesnt fix anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,auto discount for ca ebt purchasers at farmers markets has been a standard for years dont know the inception date sounds like the gov just signing off on a continuing program be nice if it was expanded to cover veggies etc from any grocers at some small level of discount
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is wellknown that these programs dont actually accomplish anything they are sop to wellmeaning middleclass liberals who like farmers markets and dont understand economics or poverty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is actually sad because it takes money out of the wallet of other californians to pay for this at least the dems will get more votes from the poor and the farmers market lobbyists
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yet another farm subsidy and since most farmers who participate drive from market to market much worse for the environment than selling produce in large grocery stores
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am governor jerry brown
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why not start a program where government pays for low income people to eat at restaurants in beverly hills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so they dont get fresh produce on food stamps in california just rotten
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh like ancient rome does the us ever have a day where it doesnt try to be rome caligula for president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is uplifting to see someone so generous with other peoples money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats uplifting about yet another wasteful government program there are million people in california this program works out to less than per person per year even if only of people are counted as low income that extra less than two bucks worth of food isnt going to make any difference
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course half of that will go to administration fees each year and will go into calpers money well spent though if youre soft headed like ca voters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my news have been uplifted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just come work for trader joes and get off of all your groceries
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the farmers market in my town is people paying the city a fee to set up tents to sell produce they bought in bulk at costco
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as far as i know most farmers markets accept ebt the one in my hometown does
UpliftingNews,not_removed,on the flip side the gas station by my house has a daily large ebt pizza special for only why is an ebt card able to be used to by gas station pizza that money would be much better spent in the grocery store buying groceries
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now were paying for peoples food
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all i read was broke ass california spends another million dollars it doesnt have for a program that no one will use
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so just because you are poor you get a discount thats fucking bullshit are you low income heres an idea get a better job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,might as well flush it down the toilet for all the good it will do hows that for uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a fucking waste of money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is awesome it would be great to gradually shift subsidies to smaller sustainable and diverse local farms it would improve public health protect crops against disease and drastically reduce transportation costs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so does it come out of taxes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,instead of dropping million in a program which probably just pays people to discount produce how about that million just straight up goes to farmers directly for all of the ugly fruitproduce that gets thrown away because supermarkets dont want to buy it for fear that it wont sell then sell that otherwise wasted food for the ultra cheap price you paid for it and win win
UpliftingNews,not_removed,low income shoppers at farmers markets whats next low income discount at expensive restaurants
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so a marketdistorting subsidy for favoured companies paid with public resources thats a house of cards move true welfare would be either programs for retrainingrehab or just give the cash to the poor directly and allowing them to consume at the most competitive outlet oh well good press favour with industry good practice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,farmers markets are generally already lower prices than grocery stores much of the produce sold at farmers markets is just grocery store produce that is about to age out you can haggle at most farmers markets reducing the price even more ca is massively in debt this was probably lobbied by some group supporting the sellers at farmers markets million in guaranteed money to them this is an absolute waste of tax money in a state that cant afford it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats great for the people of california a definite step in the right direction the amount seems small to me considering california is so large but with federal matching and this just being the start hopefully it makes a difference for the people who need it most
UpliftingNews,not_removed,taxation is the source of subsidies with the added layer of inefficiency to pay the bureaucrats administering the program how about dont take peoples money in the first place and then they can afford food on their own
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have had this in colorado for a while great program
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thankfully where i live the farmers market accepts ebt cards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tisist good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then when california is in tons of debt people are going to complain about the next schwarzenegger who cuts programs to fix the debt from the previous over spending governors
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yay an answer to a problem that doesnt exist or is at least far down the list of real problems that the state faces well done democrats any money this is just another slush fund
UpliftingNews,not_removed,million is not that much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,california giving out money they dont have cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its cool we might finally legalize recreational marijuana here and tax it properly might have some spare change rolling around like colorado does now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what if they used that to start more farms and put more produce into the market
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i understand that everyone doesnt have land but for those who own a house rather than an apartment the option of growing your own vegetables fruits and herbs always exist i know at my local walmart you can use snap benefits on fruit and veggie plants and grow your own it may take time and some dirt but it is an option even if its just a few tomatoes or herbs or some other small plant its still a good investment and that plant that cost will be worth much more down the road after harvesting it for several months my mother gets approximately in snap benefits and she spent a large majority of it on shit like bottled water snacks chips and shit frozen food just because she didnt want to cook and thought that buying fresh fruits and veggies were expensive im pretty broke but when i go grocery shopping i stock up on veggies and fruits that are on sale potatoes steak whatever is on sale lunch meat and cheese for sandwiches and a few other essential items as well as hamburger for burgers sloppy joes etc im not sure how healthy it is to eat steakburger a form of potato and a veggie or two for dinner but its healthier than the boxed shit my mother used to buy and i feel much better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when do i get an ebt card im poor dammit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,meanwhile il is about to not have a budget going into the new quarter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the state of california using jails to threaten tax payers to do what the governor thinks is right is hardly uplifing if the title were people freely give fresh produce to help the needy then we could talk because thatd be people actually doing good for one another instead i should be uplifted that the governor is making people give food to the needy by offering the gulag as an alternative
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why didnt they just make it free
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in the downside is budgeted to be thrown in the guitar case of that guy playing the eagles cover
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as this seems uplifting it seems programs of this sort are not marketed well and are a little shady my family is from income and ive seen first hand how little benefit programs are told to us then when we ask about things like this it needs to be pestered in order to find out the real deal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a really smart piece of legislation ca where i live now has a sizable budget surplus after a deficit when he took office and has jumped to the largest economy in the world brown is being very prudent with that surplus and focusing it on areas that will have long term impact like providing healthy food to those who cant typically access it very very wise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if a bunch of bananas cost and suddenly the government is going to give consumers for buying bunch of bananas then the cost of bananas will go up to and the farmers will advertise that the government will give customers back nearly everything ive encountered that involved a government subsidy paid directly to consumers has seen prices raised when i went car shopping many years ago the honda insight was the first gaselectric hybrid on the market and the federal government had a tax credit for buying alternative fuel vehicles the dealers pointed out exactly how much this credit was and what the true price of the car would be after the tax credit more recently i had a guy going doortodoor selling solar water heating panels advertising what the price would be after tax creditsdeductions theres no way hes not increasing his prices based on these subsidies the point is if i know that your ability to buy my product has increased then raising my prices will increase my revenueprofitincome with little risk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id rather he tell caltrans to get its head out of its ass and actually finish their fucking construction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,itt people not uplifted by this news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where did california get money they couldnt even pay their electric bill a few years ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im serious what is the cost of fresh corn watermelon tomatoes in ca and ny i live in rural pa and fresh produce here at roadside stands and farmers stands is significantly cheaper than local or chain grocery stores typical stand prices for a dozen eggs to for a sandwich sized tomato for a dozen ears of corn strawberries watermelons canteloupes and apples are the only fruits we have local and obviously more seasonal than veggies i think strawberries run us for a quart container watermelons are to depending on size farmers markets are under grocery prices but not as good as their stands this post blew me away til that local produce gets priced out of peoples budgets in some states this should not be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reduces regulatory burdens and let cost naturally go down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,food stamps for a farmers market i stopped getting mad and just sit in amazement at the many ways they can expand welfare and waste money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would pay million to get rid of that damned jerry brown that man pisses more of our hard earned cash down the drain than nicolas cage with real estate advertising in mexico for calfresh welfare programs waitthey arent citizens jerry and fruit really isnt all that expensive here last i checked just pissing our tax dollars away for a very elongated term
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is great a lot of data and articles have shown it is effective at combatting nutritional issues and food deserts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its funny that for those of us with different opinions reading this in the uplifting thread i saw it as intentionally ironic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is this uplifting have you learnt shit form south america
UpliftingNews,not_removed,farmers markets stopped being about produce long ago millennial trash can buy organic heirloom tomatoes at regular stores so farmers markets are about everything else they are about artisan pizza and organic hamburgers and food trucks and overpriced treats
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we just need to get rid of poverty by deporting all the illegal illiterates that cant even get a job in shithole mexico cause they cant read and write in their own language and will never learn english
UpliftingNews,not_removed,perhaps im naive in the matter but doesnt the market dictate price for example if no one buys a apple the vender will be forced to reduce their prices to prevent losing business
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yay a savings for everyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,our government is so out of tune with reality i dont even know if i can blame the government i blame everyone around me that has kids charter schools exist because of lazy parents not wanting responsibility of their shitty kids im not degreed in anything but i paid attention to shit and finished school on my own accord on time i am not better than anyone but dang man if someone like me reigns supreme in a mile radius even i know that aint right educate your people so they can learn to think of things that benefit your economy later what happened to american ingenuity that being said made me figure out where jurassic park came up with ingen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant upvote this more the amount of programs and money spent to encourage healthy eating in low income areas and demographics have failed throughout the us food stamps get spent on junk food or allow people to buy bare necessities and junk food
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its basically a cargo cult they try to imitate what the middle class would do eat vegetables and think that this is how you create more middle class
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a lot of poor people make a once a month trip to the store which means what they get needs to have a long shelf life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sad it is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe not in nyc maybe not in your case but these programs work all across the country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,forcing poor people into places they cant afford especially not where agriculture accounts for a significant part of the economy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a big stretch of through sacramento just got repaved the other night so ive got that going for me i should get to enjoy the commute home from work without pot holes for at least a couple more weeks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know i just started getting worked on which is was much needed they just recently redid in the stockton area but yeah i feel ya
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wouldnt mind crumbling roads if they at least werent filled to capacity build more freeways
UpliftingNews,not_removed,food is part of the cost of living expensive housing is certainly a problem and so is the fact that speaking broadly healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables are more expensive than unhealthy foods like chips and soda this often puts low income individuals in a position of having to chose between getting good nutrition and simply getting enough to eat the heath care costs associated with diet related diseases are no joke and then theres the fact that the supplimental nutriiton assistance program is now the pretty much the only remaining social safety net program some low income individuals receive housing assistance but far more get food assistance than housing assistance and when you struggle the both feed and house yourself everything helps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,housing prices should reflect supply and demand it shouldnt be a right to live in california for the same price i live in the midwest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,food is part of cost of living and areas with higher housing costs tend to have higher food costs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the foods still pretty expensive though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but lets force landlords to hold special below market units for poor people in places like sf just so we can pretend we are all economically equal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people need to stop breeding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,californians can at least be broke and eat better now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and taxes plus fees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think the cost comes from someone having to pay that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not about the issues in california its about the issues for lowincome families in california affording good fresh healthy food with the cost of living can be nearly impossible or impossible for lowincome families this becomes especially true in innercity food deserts where even the ability to possibly buy fresh food is removed as the nearest grocery store can be miles and miles away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,add to that pollution traffic crime and overall unpleasant arid climate still baffles me how rich people voluntarily live in california worst bang for your buck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the problem is the rent is too damn high vote jimmy mcmillan for california governor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is true but overpaying for food is a problem nationwide mostly due to culture making fresh produce at farmers markets as appealing as possible to low income individuals is still a very good thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plenty of cheaper places to live
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ever been to whole foods
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the healthier alternative to cheap junk food comes with a high price tag this is a problem we have a class divide in healthy eating local fresh produce from a farmers market costs more than the junk food at fast food restaurants its an unfortunate reality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats because the state is run by morons and everything is done to about commitment or crookedly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it probably still way more than they need considering that poor people usually dont give a shit about cheap vegetables
UpliftingNews,not_removed,admittedly i know nearly nothing about ca politics and budgets but maybe this is something that will grow as more people use it million now million next year as the public sees the positive impact this makes for low income people and farmers market maybe im just hopeful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gonna be buried but wtf most farmers markets arent from farmers theyre resellers for ugly produce at a markup
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lived in slo recently and lived their farmers market my favorite by far
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i went to the farmers market in santa fe nm and was extremely impressed that they offer to spend there for of snap benefits i had not heard of such a thing here in illinois
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its almost like things make sense when you dont take them in bad faith
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a few years ago i had wic and the farmers markets give you to spend there idk if this is just in sd though it was for anyone using an assistance program
UpliftingNews,not_removed,umm the farmers market produce is cheap because of the state subsidy if the state gave that to grocery stores their food would be cheaper face palm imo it should be given to improve education
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know that most people who are poor remain poor because they are lazy too lazy to cook and shop for fresh produce
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its harder than it sounds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the evidence shows that the population of california is increasing not decreasing httpsenwikipediaorgwikidemographicsofcalifornia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes that added tax burden of approximately cents per citizen annually will surely throw the state into chaos a state that is losing population at a rate ofoh wait california grew by last year httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofusstatesbypopulationgrowthrate plz try again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whos leaving the state i believe our population is growing yeah cost of living is high but we will work on it we met the gov drought goal and we can tackle the housing market every place has its ups and downs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,doesnt matter poor people arent getting up at fuckall in the morning to drive to the farmers market anyway if the governor and legislature gave a shit theyd subsidize fruit and vegetables at the supermarkets poor people can shop at and maybe subsidize some supermarkets in the places where there arent any
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i dont understand this im not low income but i am in college and cant afford to spend money on food so i have a very simple food budget i stock up on chicken when it goes on sale at my local grocery then freeze it to last until the next sale veggies from costco where i can get pounds for dollars which makes the fifty dollar a year membership worth it which i split with the gf and rice or potatoes bought in bulk id love to buy my food organic or get steaks nice fruits etc but thats not feasible for me so i live within my means i really dont see the point subsidizing million so low income people can buy fruit thats the same as from the supermarket but way more money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,interesting that you view farmers market prices as high most of the research out there shows that farmers market prices arent higher than grocery stores
UpliftingNews,not_removed,correct its our legislature not fixing anything and giving shit out to get elected again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats something i can get behind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im pretty sure most californians support the farmers market lobby they are hugely popular they support local and central valley farmers who tend to be very republican and are a wonderful way to bring the community togther
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you make less than a year per person someone richer than you is subsidizing you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,once they start throwing bread to people at sports events well just start saying hail caesar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the million isnt being given to calfresh participants of which there are about million to spend each at a farmers market the money is spent to establish discount programs for calfresh participants to use their existing allocation to buy as reduced prices from farmers markets across the state of which there are a multitude of different farmers markets thats million on administration to facilitate the program you can balk at the cost but individual calfresh participants will get far more than a out of the deal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now youve gone and offended quite a few people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some people including a number of homeless people have no access to refrigerators or stoves so this is how they can eat a hot meal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its hard for me to see this as a waste of money considering the money we piss away on the military this is cheaper and actually benefits peoples lives instead of simply going into the pockets of rich people while providing very little benefit at least spending this money wont lead to the creation of another isis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,relax it averages to like cents a person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a reason large grocery stores beat out smaller grocery stores theyre more efficient and thus offer lower prices and because customers prefer them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel sorry for the middle class who really cant live in california want a one income house not here buddygovernator evil laugh its simple economics when you tax the crap out of your people the cost of living goes up you cant just subsidies everything unless you dont realize that someone is paying the bill for this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where else would it come from the government doesnt have money to pay for things without taking it from the people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they arent expensive if you dont buy at the hip ones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,allowing them to consume at the most competitive outlet like fast food places often the most convenient and most advertised place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the california state budget was billion this program cost million dollars thats percent of the state budget the budget that the state passed was balanced and the state is paying down its debt the state of california pays for healthcare for low income residents spending money on improving the diet of those residents saves on healthcare costs in the long run this is exactly the sort of thing the state should be spending money on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but this money unlike money spent at most stores goes back into the local economy also it might give low income people more insensitive to eat healthier and health costs are a pretty big drain on the economy i see this as a good move
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is chump change to california how ignorant your comment is smh do you even live in california such ignorant comments much of the produce sold at farmers markets is just grocery store produce that is about to age out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a californian i believe we currently have a budget surplus and as a taxpayer i have no problem funding something like this even if its only to incentivize people to go to farmers markets that means supporting a local farmers and our local economies a lot more and im always down for that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its definitely small relative to the size of the state given the population of million that averages to like cents per person even if they define low income as the bottom that comes to like bucks a person and thats ignoring administration costs doesnt seem like enough to have a noticeable effect on eating habits
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep leave it up to individuals to take care of the poor thatll make sure those in need get help and itll make sure cheap fucks with money give little or nothing at all good luck with the honor system of taking care of your neighbors
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres been a lot of talk in la about creating farmers markets in lowincome areas of south la to help elevate the food desserts that exist in some neighborhoods i hope a measure like this helps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes thats what this program is for shoppers using their ebt cards at farmers markets get extra money for fruits an vegetables
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah even here inhuh did someone say txthey accept ebt at the farmers markets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no water california already outproduces any other farming land in the world that mill will be a complete waste
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you have a link to a reputable news source for the advertisinginmexico claim ive never heard that and couldnt find it googling just now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be fair this program is criticized it is said by some for inflating the cost of produce at farmers markets i mean the preexisting situation of allowing calfresh to cover produce from a farmers market not this new million administrative program for the farmers who sell at my local farmers market and also sell to local grocery stores it is cheaper for me to buy their produce from the grocery store
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really not sure where you live but where im at in nc the farmers markets always have tons of various produce and fruit with some meats thats probably then you have the crafts and artisan stuff but yeah theres no shortage of produce
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the market dictates the base price but government policy can adjust that price via taxes subsidies etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well its kind of a different case for this here here there are people who buy apples at that price and the farmers are fine so the price stands this policy is more or less supposed to help the people who fall below the threshold to be able to buy the apples because the apples currently are at their lowest market price this isnt supposed to directly effect apple prices just help people who couldnt normally buy them buy them so theyll be able to eat healthier
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or they might stop growing and selling apples and instead grow corn to make cheap sugar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cheap healthy food below market cost benefits everyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for the wealthy maybe but the low income family that could use this money probably doesnt pay enough in taxes to see a benefit i think the main idea here is to help encourage farmers markets in food deserts and promote healthy eating among lower income familys i think one could argue that combating the lose of affordable housing is a more pressing issue but i feel like people are still trying to find a good solution to that issue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the million isnt being given to calfresh participants of which there are about million to spend what would come out to each at a farmers market the money is spent to establish discount programs for calfresh participants to use their existing allocation to buy as reduced prices from farmers markets across the state of which there are a multitude of different farmers markets thats million on administration to facilitate the program you can balk at the cost but individual calfresh participants will get far more than a in value out of the deal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,charter schools exist at the national level where lobbyists are deployed to individual states to push for charter legislation to eliminate teacher unions charter schools are founded without them drain students typically affluent students from traditional public schools as traditional schools are starved of funding districts close school sites and consolidate they become a gravity well for high need students charter schools then move into the vacant school sites push us closer to privatization public schools and entire districts run by corporations and nonprofits complete takeover has already occurred in some places at the local level yes theres a feeling that anyone can open a charter school and as such there can be good intentions in the founding of some charter schools in other cases they are straight up moneymaking operations
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like the rise in charter schools at least in la is less about the citystate gov and more about the behemoth that is lausd its like ladwp sort of its own self sustaining monster that lashes out at anything working for reform that said i hope change will come and ill def vote for anything that will help
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats why put green carts on every corner we set up about of them even installed food stamp card readers for extra stuff didnt work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what does work mean
UpliftingNews,not_removed,silky smoooooth i thought the roads were pretty good before though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am getting my masters in urban planning and i can tell you that building more freeways does nothing to alleviate traffic it only encourages further car use while cutting communities in two instead what we should do is focus development in city and toen centres close to services and recreation and work so that drive times are shorter or more ideally that we can rely on walkingbikingpublic transit to get to where we need to go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,drive less cars we have so many alternative forms of transportation at this point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,chips and soda arent really cheap compared to vegetables more convenient at times but not really different enough in price to be the excuse it is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when people make this claim that junk food is cheaper than fruits and vegetables i always wonder like have you ever gone grocery shopping fruits and vegetables are really cheap isnt a bag of chips like three bucks and frozen food is way expensive too its got very little to do with cost of goods but rather with the fact that many people dont know how to cook
UpliftingNews,not_removed,healthy food is not more expensive i keep seeing this myth and its just simply not true i have actually lived on a week eating meals a day of healthy foods i was able to eat meat fruit vegetables rice bread and milk every single day the only problem was that the diet got very boring towards the end if i wasnt on such a high protein diet i could have way more variety in my diet meat was by far my biggest expense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was recently offered in san jose for a software engineering gig thats about more then i make in austin where a house costs and no state income tax people in softwareengineering make to work there i though it was a good offer i started doing research and bloomberg looked at the census and found median home prices were bloomberg calculated your minimum salary to support a mortgage would be that means to afford house transportation food and simple luxuries you need i called the recruiter back countering for she said they cant do that dont they offer work from home for outstate workers no oh just policy gotcha then i told her the position isnt economically viable because there is absolutely no way to survive she said its definitely doable i told her how my compensation is so much more where im at now my dollar buys me more outside of san jose the call was over pretty much i wanted to ask how many strangers live in her house to help her family with rent i dont believe it if i wanted to be net negative financially id work for walmart and use welfare but in that case i could live anywhere in the country california where a company will lease a billion dollar lakefront corporate office but then wonders why it cant find any us talent and has to post visas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes food is a part of the cost of living but housing in california is disproportionately much more expensive than most other states this becomes more obvious if you compare ca to the rest of the country compare the relative prices of a gallon of milk or a big mac then do the same for housing and youll see do this statewide just to see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is a flat out myth that eating healthy is expensive it is just plainly false if you can wrap your head around not eating meat frequently or at all it is way cheaper than eating like garbage my family eats like absolute kings for month four individuals though no teens yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so a government solution to a govt created problem jesus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,food in ca is cheaper than most places so if anything it contributes to a lower cost of living so much ignorance about ca in this thread
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets compare apples oranges to your soda and chips apples here are roughly oranges about so you will get approximately or for that money a soda is like per chips roughly the same for a oz bag does anyone with common sense think it is wise to choose the crap food
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a dream that one day everyone will be on snap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most of them are illegals trump believe me so important
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you who says its a right to be able to pay below a market price for housing rent control laws in cities even tend to do the opposite of their intent and actually raise the cost of living by further limiting supply
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i moved from silicon valley to boulder county food is way cheaper in california than it is in colorado except for eggs strangely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,food is cheaper in ca most of the fresh produce in the us is farmed in ca anyone who says food in ca is expensive doesnt know shit about fuck all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,food is actually the cheapest its been ever in human history
UpliftingNews,not_removed,speaking of which has the high speed rail boondoggle passed billion dollars yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,had to scroll way too far to see this to be fair though the general population of reddit probably most likely doesnt know how broke california is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,california is not alone in that regard but due to its size its nonsense is amplified
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know the farmers markets by me accept food stamp programs already and while admirable this is about down the drain the problem is farmers market shoppers and food stamp users are a ven diagram that doesnt have a lot of overlap the mil isnt enough to do anything aside from wasting it and then patting yourself on the back for making a difference if anything better programs to overlap that ven diagram would be better the problem with fresh healthy food isnt the cost its already pretty cheap its the time and inconvenience of cooking it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup i mean i roll my eyes when people gush over how cheap the price is its usually more than what i pay at grocery store on top of that much of the produce us local as in from states away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not saying thats not an issue but do you have some sort of source to corroborate the claim of most
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think you mean some not most it does happen but ive been to farmers markets as both a consumer and a farmer and there are definitely many people who are selling what theyve grown personally its going to depend on where you live if you are some crappy city then yeah thats what youre going to get but if youre in a rural area youre likely going to get local produce
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep the farmers market near me has only one farmer and a bunch of people reselling crap that they bought at sams club
UpliftingNews,not_removed,slo the only place on earth i hope to retire too some day but not if people know it exists lets keep slo a private place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all we get is corn lots and lots of corn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at the local farmers market that is sponsored by the city where i live in illinois you can cash in a certain amount of your snap benefits to get tokens to spend at the farmers market you get double the value and ive often noticed that theyll throw in extra or let it ride if you dont have enough tokens just to make sure that you get a good amount of veggies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,here stalls at the farmers market are required to accept special tokens some stalls only take tokens to purchase these tokens with card theres a fee which is used to provide lowcost food for lowincome individuals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i believe its a federal program that states can apply for i think its one of those things where if the state puts up a certain amount of the money the feds will match it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,double snap is common at farmers markets in georgia too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most foods in grocery stores are subsidized actually fruits and vegetables receive very little in comparison most things in the middle of the store have corn also wheat soy rice in them these are heavily subsidized and also used as animal feed also it makes sense that food at a farmers market would be cheaper because you are removing the middle man and buying direct from the farmer i agree that money would be better spent on education money for fruits and vegetables im not so sure i mean a cheeseburger costs less than a cucumber
UpliftingNews,not_removed,every year encouraging people to eat healthier and avoid prepackaged foods in my opinion is education in my family its called nutrition and health care
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the population is growing at about an average pace compared to the country at large but this is because of foreign immigration on the domestic front california has significantly more people leaving for other states than coming one random source i found quickly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can tell who gets their talkingpoints from foxnews they all think california is some horrible thirdworld country in debt foxnews just hasnt reported the success of a democratic governor democratic supermajorities in both chambers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,isnt that what food stamps are for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is just wrong plenty of poor people work hard but sometimes thats not enough to escape poverty living in california i guarantee this program will benefit thousands of hard working lower class people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id like to know what part of the country they studied in maine new hampshire and mass farmers markets are on par with whole foods which is to say much more expensive than a normal grocery store like market basket
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was just going to point this out plus if you go to a fm right before closing you can usually haggle the price down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,politics in texas are far from ideal so let me state up front that im not deluded into thinking its some sort of utopia in this regard however our approach of only letting the legislature meet for about months every other year has a lot of advantages
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure free is great but californians lose
UpliftingNews,not_removed,um no you are full of shite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that doesnt make it right milton friedman an economist who was a strong proponent of the free market did not blame those who looked after their shortterm interest but when an entire society does it it comes down to extended poverty look at venezuela
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its just that in my city its not uncommon for or families to be living under roof a ebt pizza seems like a great dealonly option for a hot meal for many people in that situation rather than buying groceries and preparing a meal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fair enough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if they wanted to benefit peoples lives they would subsidize these healthier foods everywhere not just at farmers markets that most poor people people dont patronize
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fair enough we should spend the money on neither
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most militarydefense spending goes to salaries and those salaries go to people that generally came from lower socioeconomic classes defense spending is more than anything else a jobs program
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to give what a dollar or two to a few people to take advantage of the program while god knows how much gets wasted in the administration of said program
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wouldnt markets be the cheapest and most efficient little to no rent no lighting or heating no need for expensive furniture and equipment can be held wherever there is need often cuts out the middleman thereby offering lower prices
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can definitely see the benefits of both largescale stores and farms buying in bulk certainly does cut save overheads i also agree that many people would choose a brand store that they trust especially when traveling however many people and more everyday are enjoying the fun environment of small markets to each their own i would like to see both accessible to people you also cannot argue that diverse diet is better diverse crops are better in some ways and that local production and consumption massively reduce petroleum consumption
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hence spending on education being important tax externalities dont subsidize
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant help but notice that the article only lists people on federal assistance benefits as beneficiaries of the program as such i cant help but wonder how much of this program california is paying for and how much comes from the federal government if california paid for all of it wouldnt people on state programs alone benefit as well putting that aside million adds up across thousands of programs and tax credits california has more than commissions committees councils and boards as a part of the state government who come up with roughly several thousand laws and proposals each year which includes things like a plan to issue tax credits for commercial spacship parts built in the mojave desert its hard to view something that specific as anything other than a waste of time and money this is a deep problem many of these committees are paid salaries and more still are volunteers with their expenses comped by the state for most these committee budgets would seem small like paying a salary of to a handful of peoplebut across just of these committees that by itself would be a year on top of thousands of small programs such as this one in other words its a seemingly small part of the budgetbut its also a part of californias death by a thousand cuts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lold at healthcare paid for low income residents maybe if youre a knocked up female ive been uninsured for of the last years and dont qualify for shit except an obamacare plan that covers hardly a thing for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but this money unlike money spent at most stores goes back into the local economy im not sure what you think happens to the money that goes into the cash register at the store but it doesnt fly to japan it pays the rent on the building locally it pays the people who delivered the food locally it pays the people who work thereand unless they have very generous salaries they probably livelocally
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its completely false his comments are an insult to anyone whos been in the farming business have no clue why anyone would upvote him this is coming from someone who lives in california and does know a bit about farming and farms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in what world is million dollars chump change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when added to the hundreds of other taxpayer funded relection appeasements itnreally begins to add up yes i live here and i get tired of watching the basic things the government should be taking care of fall apart like our roads and transportation publicity stunts with taxpayer money needs to stop our education system is shit our homeless programs are underfunded our colleges are way too costly our roads are packed and the projects get funded a decade too late and make no difference in traffic its bullshit we shouldnt have to have a private company build toll roads on government property so i can get home from work in less the three hours fix whats broken now and work on testing shit out when we have a surplus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats what i was getting at but at least its been implemented or is going to be look at it as a trial and error period hopefully they can get the system down and then work on increasing the funds to levels where a real impact could be had
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep leave it up to individuals to take care of the poor thatll make sure those in need get help private charity is infinitely more efficient than government agencies at helping the poor and infinitely more motivated to do so bureaucrats have no incentive to solve a problem that would make their jobs irrelevant and itll make sure cheap fucks with money give little or nothing at all why should people who dont want to help others be robbed if they earned their money it is theirs to allocate as they see fit not yours good luck with the honor system of taking care of your neighbors youre being snide but thats how helping others should work without fucking over some people to perpetuate the illusion of helping others
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what is an ebt card
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i forget that nestle is slowly turning california into a desert maybe thats the prequel to mad max fury road
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that happened right after he got elected his second term he sent money to mexican radio stations to advertise for the calfresh program over there it was on cnn when it happened years ago but its difficult trying to locate it anything to get those votes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then subsidize that not food they dont have time to make its not their fault its not my fault its the legislature that continually makes expensive programs that dont address the real issues or go after the problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lolwut you need to go to asia and africa my friend poor people there work just as hard or even harder since govt benefits are abysmal and still have to cook because traditional fast food like mcd is a luxury to most
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who works jobs and has time to cook healthy meals a day do you its easy to think less of people when you have no idea what its like living their lives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because lazy and stupid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because they are working jobs to make good healthy food is time consuming and not something people would be excited for after working long daysweird schedules for some unhealthy meals is convenient and fends off hungernot what they want but something that becomes custom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,poor peoplefast food ugggggggh if you are working jobs a day and you cant afford fruits and veggies you have issues
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except it seems some americans think public transit is for scrubs like i told my husband i could take the bus and he laughed and told me id get stabbed do we live in a bad neighborhood no i also see shiny new bus stops around all fancy and pretty but no the transit is for criminals and people who lost their license seems to be a running joke with family and friends she wanted to take the bus and they are all like lawl bus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does it help alleviate traffic if you have tolls honest question it seems like not many people would want to pay a toll so less would be on that road but im not educated in that area so id love some insight
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh that really depends where you live if youre in a big city like la and work in la perhaps you can bike from your apartment to your workplace but a lot of the surrounding areas especially the further you go east toward anaheim and past towards riverside you really have no means but to hop on the freeways and commute due to the typically large distance between your domicile and workplace im not sure if things change much up in norcal but down here its an entirely automotive world especially with the heat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unless you live outside the la basin metrolink is a joke and the buses are impractical to use
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am a reddit vegan and live on doritos and mountain dew
UpliftingNews,not_removed,down votes potatoe chips are the most expensive way to purchase potatoes in the market
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can confirm i live in the nicest neighborhood in houston and i eat lintel soup at home some nights chicken legs and peas for dinner other nights costs me a portion its education that people need i do not buy soda anymore either huge waste of money so is powerradegatoraid drink tea instead i also try and drink of water a day edit portion is probably over estimating it probably more like actually i eat vegan food vietnamese food japanese food chinese food middle eastern food mexican food brazilian foods and much more i like having a nice bowl of spinach sliced grilled or baked chicken breast poppy seed dressing or your favorite choice pita chips blue cheese crumbles choppedmatchstick carrots and a big glass of water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hmm the process of cooking potatoes doesnt really make it seem cheap to me purchasing the raw potatoes the necessary appliances ingredientsthe time seems cheaper to just buy a bag of chips
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eating an bag of chips feels more filling than an serving of veggies the fats in the chips make you feel full veggies are more nutritious but not as satiating lots of families choose the food that makes them feel full in order to feel as full from veggiesfruit youd have to eatbuy more thats part of the reason junk food is cheaper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,parents are probably too busy working two jobs that they dont bother to cook so junk food can be cheaper than and faster than cooking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its also a lot about caloric density
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not doubting you but can you give an example of what one day of that looks like so i can see if its for me to try as well i eat cereal in the morning for example and with buy one get one deals can get two full boxes for less than four dollars and enough milk for it for three and i eat more than many i only absorb half the nutrients so its a necessity so that would cover all my breakfasts curious about the other two
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why are you on a highprotein diet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a meal i can buy an apple
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe they have a policy of needing to show attempts at hiring within the country before they hire outside of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you broke the code those companies want to pay low wages and have lavish hqs and perks for the brass robber barrons of the century yet media darlings sad but true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a big part if the cost is time and energy preparing a meal takes more time than microwaving a box or buying fast food or chips also healthy food tends to last a shorter time spoiling requiring more frequent trips to the store these may seem trivial but they are still obstacles combine them with the yum that is bad food and ypu have a real problem not saying i agree since i eat well but after a full day of classes with research to do crap has more appeal than cutting up veggies even though it takes minutes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay it may not be more expensive but the bigger issue may be things like food desert that exist in low income neighborhoods some neighborhoods in south la dont have easy access to grocery stores as ridiculous as that sounds edit desserts are tasty deserts are not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup all that money is worthless if people still eat wrong which is to say in the us eat too much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cause people are lazy and stupid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but how do you eat a meal with no meat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we voted on a bill a few years back that requires that might be the reason behind that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its because of ca is farmland
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no need to worry they can tax the emissions its wildly successful i hear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they think they are all surfers and rich probably its basically northern mexico with how corrupt and broken the government is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,came here to say this i work my ass off all week love to cook and have trouble making it to the grocery store in between let alone a farmers market im also in socal i started doing blue apron recently to save time and force myself to cook more instead time is the thing thats at a premium ps wrong use of buy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what is slo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,went to college there crazy expensive place to live but one of the nicest and well kept cities i have ever been to i visit often and wish i could afford to buy a house there head hours inland in ca and we have pretty affordable housing sq ft home bed bath in ca it doesnt get more affordable than that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anyway like i was sayin shrimp corn is the fruit of the sea you can barbecue it boil it broil it bake it saute it deys uh tortillas corn bread tamales pan fried deep fried stirfried theres high fructose corn syrup corn starchethanol hominy corn flakes corn flour and popcorn that thats about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,corn is so good i really want some corn now nice and fresh none of that popped shit mmmmm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,peoria
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are aware that grocery stores carry produce right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,by the same slippery slope fallacy your option calls abortion subsidiaries educational thankfully were free to ignore the silly opinions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,since when does immigration not count thats just a silly way to view the issue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,success paid for by the taxpayers of primarily republicans lmao raising taxes and claiming victory is a thing now i guess meanwhile is on year of repairs in the same strip of highway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it can be which is why this program is a waste when they could have just expanded food program payments but also the food stamp programs dont specifically subsidize healthier food
UpliftingNews,not_removed,farmers markets in california take food stamps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes a certain level and regional distribution of more privileged lowermiddle income workers will benefit a little it would help even more people if it was not restricted to farmers markets that most poor people dont have access to then it would help all the poorer people whether they can patronize a farmers market or not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think were talking about different kinds of farmers market one kind is the hipster farmers market where rich people go to buy organic shit thats super expensive the other kind is in the parking lot of a big mall on sunday where local farmers try to sell you huge boxes of fruit for really cheap but nothing fancy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe its because produce is grown everywhere in california but produce at farmers markets near me is definitely on par with average groceries stores flowers are significantly less than stores or florists prepared food items though like cookies or sauces are more much more expensive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre probably comparing organicheirloom to conventional produce and maybe dayfresh local to five daysold from chile this kills the vit a it is really a win for ca to use a little encouragement to get snap money spent on local food an even bigger win is the usda has already tested this in pilot and it increases fresh food consumption
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there have been a few different locations studied including vermont this article cites a few examples
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some vendors will give away produce for free its the best time to go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,free what you still gotta buy shit from the local farmers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,milton friedman was pro basic income lol anyway for every venezuela there is a sweden more to do with homogeneity vs tribalism i am actually for freewill taxation and privatelyfunded incentives and bi like googlefbnike bankrolling the bi experiment in kenya
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are correct however people have proven they make the wrong decisions on a regular basis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure but these things are all included in the prices and the performance of these stores theres a reason prices are lower in big stores theres a reason the small stores are doing poorly and the big ones are doing well its because people prefer them to go and say that small stores have advantages is double counting when a person decides to shop at a large store vs a small store hes already considered all the things you bring up and has decided that hed still rather go to the large store of course small stores have a place and people still want them thats why they still exist but now youre saying we should give small stores special advantage special subsidies an unlevel playing field youre calling specifically for a market intervention to favor small stores over large stores but theres no market failure have a little confidence in the free market to deliver what people actually want when youre dealing in an area like this one where theres no reason to intervene
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah in the end no one should need to work twothree jobs a day resulting in being left with no time or energy to cook or learn how to cook though i think this doesnt just require boosting and improving education spending
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant help but wonder how much of this program california is paying for and how much comes from the federal government given how much californians send to the federal government its pretty much the same thing they still send out more money than they get back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you sound salty af
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty big difference between a chain supermarket or a walmart compared to a farmers market though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have you ever been a local producer or know anyone local farmers are getting pushed out by big companies and grocery chains the guys you see at these local farmers market rely on their produce for a living helping out a few local farmers is not going to kill everyone elses job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,put it into perspective california is the us leading agricultural producer there are over thousands of farmers markets total in the state of california its not like the farmers market miles from your home is getting and the one away is getting a chunk of put into perspective of all of the state spendings its chump change nothing even close a regular highschool football field costs to build is chump change when you put things into perspective
UpliftingNews,not_removed,short answer foodstamps longer answer in the united states snap wic and a host of other government programs that give subsidies to low income individuals or families now use an atm type card which is generally known as an ebt card this allows food and cash benefits to be accessed at many locations with the benefits being debited from your account immediately using the same basic technology that debit cards work on ebt cards are a vast improvement over couponration type books of literal food stamps and as the cards are electronic if the card is lost or stolen the card can be deactivated preserving any unused credits httpsenwikipediaorgwikielectronicbenefittransfer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,government assistance electronic benefit transfer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well without a link to a reputable news source i cant believe it it sounds like an email my grandma would forward to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not food they dont have time to make give me an example a recipe that you consider a typical dish that could be eaten daily considering price and nutritional value that takes too much time to make
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats just like telling someone they cant complain because there are starving children in africa it does absolutely nothing at all theres always someone who has it worse somewhere else that doesnt make your problems any less real
UpliftingNews,not_removed,takes about minutes to saute some vegetables takes about minutes plus waiting to make a delicious completely nutritional soup can you guys really not grasp the idea that there are in fact people who could be eating healthy but choose not to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,subsidize slow cookers put good food in at the start of the day food is cooked by the end
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id like them to spend a day or two in nyc and then see if they laugh at public transit its not ideal but you dont wanna keep spending every day for parking and in parking tickets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have you ever ridden transit for an extended period of time i did for about and it sucked dealing with panhandlers and the trains smelled like piss one day i got fed up and started driving again about quicker for me each way and i had the use of my car during the day transit not even once
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is really more of an elitist attitude i understand it completely having met so many people who smugly disregard any mention of taking a bus anywhere its really not that bad its true that there arent that many white people around which makes some people uncomfortable but other than that its basically filled with people who need to go someplace and dont have a car or dont want to sit around in bumper to bumper traffic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people in la love the good public transit there is a subway system anything within walking range of that subway system is very expensive to live at but really nice too bad it doesnt cover more area beat the hell out of driving the busses and bus ways suck but the subway is really nice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do it in protest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your husband isnt a good sample id use public transit if it didnt cost more than my car and take as long
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nobody
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im perfectly happy to use the bus i mean there are things that are frustrating about it but having a car all to myself seems silly and wasteful edit id consider travelling by bike too but i never learned how to ride one and sharing roads with drivers seems dangerous as fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,up here in the bay area we have cal trans that basically means you can bike from your home to anywhere so long as your on the west side of the bay i have no idea how the east bay handles things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed i lived in the inland empire growing up and public transportation was a nonoption but there are lots of places where its so much of a solution that its silly for people to demand more roads
UpliftingNews,not_removed,regular or code red mountain dew
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but artificial colors and flavors come from petroleum which comes from dinosaurs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i used to drink mtn daily for the past years finally quit and indeed i feel better and more clear minded the phosphoric acid leeching calcium from the bones is no bueno
UpliftingNews,not_removed,other than vodka of course
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right but pretending that eating healthy is some extravagant luxury absolves a whole bunch of people of having any personal responsibility whatsoever and reddit loves that shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and the oil they are slathered in makes them very calorie dense i dont suggest living off of them but your daily caloric needs can be met in a few dollars in chips
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i came here to point out iced tea as a way to have a tasty beverage for just a few pennies i dont buy soft drinks although i can afford them it boils down to education lots of people would say healthy food is gross without knowing anything about it before i was financially stable i lived off eggs potatoes rice and tomatoes you can make some good food with simple cheap ingredients
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people facing that kind of financial hardship live in rental property that already provide stovesovensetc and pots and pans are available at goodwillsalvation armythrift stores for literally a few dollars the level of excuses is getting ridiculously deep the only applicable part you mention is convenience which really comes back to priorities
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the necessary appliances
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres always an excuse followed with bag logic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,junk food is cheaper because the families dont have to prepare the food to be eaten a lot of the people receiving these benefits work shitty jobs with long and sometimes unpredictable hours having to cook and clean on top of a rough job can leave them with almost no time to spend with their families so the choice becomes do i want to spend minutes to an hour cooking and cleaning everyday or do i buy less healthy food
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the real problem time poverty leads to shitty meal preparation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you by stuff thats on sale especially meat in the larger valuepacks its definitely doable im in socal and this week the grocery store ads chicken drumsticks cents a pound carrots cents a pound cantaloupes cents a pound avocados cents each peaches cents a pound mangos cents each button mushrooms dollars a pound green onions cents a bunch at a second market tomatoes cents a pound chicken drums or thighs cents a pound boneless skinless chicken breasts a pound pork sirloin roastchops a pound generally theres more produce on sale cabbage was lbs for a dollar recently spinach was less than a bunch red bell peppers for a dollar a pound green beans a pound okra is right now a pound these you dont need weekly sales and can always find before you run out potatoes per pound bag rice you can get for around a pound on pound bags onions lbs per dollar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i normally eat cereal too and was really sad that i couldnt include it in my budget for the challenge anyways a typical day was milk slices of bread with peanut butter for breakfast lunch was usually just some milk and apple im not much of a lunch person and was busy with school at the time dinner was the big meal which was typically chicken thigh dry weight white rice trust me its a lot of rice when cooked and either quarter head cabbage or a few large carrots i also saved all the scraps from the veggies and the bones from the chicken to make my own soup
UpliftingNews,not_removed,think of it like mexican day burritos chinese day stir fry italian day pastapizza cali day saladssmoothies soup day hotcold soup go out and eat day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rice potatoes canned beans bananas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they expected him to move into an unheated hovel with six roommates thats how everyone else does it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,totally agree these are the main problems subsidizing farmer markets addresses none of these issues though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no it does not take significantly longer to prepare healthy food no it is not easier to microwave a box than it is to open a can of beans and microwave frozen vegetables with rice healthy food does not spoil any faster when purchased in appropriate quantities these are excuses not reasons you have time i am a full time graduate student i also have a full time job unrelated to my position in school i also have two small children and a home to maintain and last week i actually got the ball rolling on a small farm ill be opening finally people have time most people anyway what most people dont have are clearly defined priorities or the willingness to spend an afternoon outlining their lifes plans and my first marathon will be in november
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i highly doubt that farmers markets are popping up in food deserts farmers markets dont really provide any health benefits over your standard grocery store this bill is a middle class persons idea of what a poor person needs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while i like food desserts food deserts sound like hell on earth agreed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is true but its more complicated than just access ive known people who were poor that would do all of their grocery shopping as gas stations because it was the most convenient thing between work and home or closest to home even if they have a car or easy access to a bus these people were paying more for crap food frequently poor people never learned good money management or not to do the most convenient thing which means they are never going to buy cheap healthy food that they have to spend minutes preparing im not implying that poor people are all bad with money ive also known many with the budgeting abilities of a computer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its absolutely true and i wish it didnt sound ridiculous its a cycle no grocers are going to open up in a low income neighborhood but plenty of fast food restaurants will it just makes it even more difficult for low income neighborhoods to get healthy foods
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes why should you pay attention to the choices you make probably doesnt matter anyways what could happen that my friend is pure ignorance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes why should you pay attention to the choices you make probably doesnt matter anyways what could happen that my friend is pure ignorance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good im a cunt and youre sensitive about internet message board decorum id rather be a cunt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id argue its not portion size but food choice at no serving size is any fast food soft drink or most of the inexpensive prepared foods readily available a healthy choice this doesnt mean were not also overeating we are half of a big mac is comparatively better than a whole big mac but it is still objectively negative to your health to consume
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and how can you have any pudding if you dont eat your meats
UpliftingNews,not_removed,by eating vegetarian meals you know vegetables legumes grains fruits etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,san luis obispo its a cute area
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats true i plan to go back to do more school there soon ish but yeah quite expensive going to school there before i had to have a two jobs one trimming all the trees in downtown slo area so yeah very well kept city with people working their ass off to keep it that way which is a good sign people like it there but definitely worth it the place could use a little tourism but mainly because firestone grill needs to be everywhere in my life and not just there and cambria best fries on the planet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,corn dogs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is fantastic but when you live near farmland it gets tiring every season ive run out of ideas to do to make corn interesting to eat my mom even made corn smoothies which surprisingly is delicious cup of ice corn milk and some condensed milk delicious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man i love when people on reddit use fallacies to sound smarter and then just fuck shit up anyways when the internet is right there to help them out anytime they need with just a little search of what is this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont follow when schwarzenegger left office we were in a terrible financial situation jerry brown the democrat pulled us kicking and screaming back out we pay more to the federal on top of all this brown has shown himself to be a centrist by consistently blocks bills that come out of the majority democrat state legislator which i might add is not gerrymandered but set up by a non partisan board so i promise you the state is overwhelmingly democrat so who are these republicans that are paying for our success cause as far as i can tell we as a state are working hard and working together to pull ourselves up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes governing and collecting taxes is a mark of a successful state government amazing how things work when the pays their fair share nice try on the paid primarily by republicans bit you added there democrats outnumber republicans here by million registered voters and even the here is evenly liberalconservative
UpliftingNews,not_removed,governor of maine tried to specify that and all the reddit liberals crucified him for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was thinking that people would confuse the trendy every suburb farmers markets that go on with the actual farmers market that most cities have in an older part of the city that operate daily
UpliftingNews,not_removed,heres a good way to figure out which one you are dealing with go there ask yourself is there a lot of farms nearby if yes its probably local farmers if not its probably the rich people version
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for the link i was getting annoyed and confused by the claims about how hipster and expensive these markets are too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uh i thought the idea was to go right when they open so as to not end up with pickedover crap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i did some googling and the facts check out the venezuela to sweden ratio is indeed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess its the kids i really feel bad for they often have no choice in whats to eat i dont want anyone to go hungry but damn its a shitty situation all around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i see your point and agree with minimizing tampering with the free market i was referring to redirecting some of the massive government subsidies that currently go towards lowering the cost of mass produced corn beef and petroleum and giving a little to markets that tend to sell locally produced goods this isnt some small market vs supermarket thing i just think that since we already subsidize goods may as well subsidize some of the ones that will decrease public health expenditure and petroleum use basically saying we should give a bit of that cornbeef govment money to fruits and veggies too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who said it would kill anyones job i just dispute claims that money spent at chains does not mostly stay local it just goes to different local people also all farmers everywhere rely on their produce for a living thats because theyre farmers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,californian here as well our whole budget which we are heavily in debt is million dollars here and there spread over hundreds or thousands of programs so someone gets to spend more at a farmers market maybe glad my taxes are helping them out ps my job is agriculture big business is not pushing out farmers environmental restraints hurt them far more and plums and walnuts have been grossly overpaid for the last years they have been raking it in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats very helpful thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i will look around some more for a link but it did happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anything that takes over minutes can be considered too much time if you are tired having to make sure you have each of the ingredients can also take too much time overhead times should definitely be included in preparation times
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is the argument given above that they work too many hours to cook veggies i cook all the time and work hour weeks but i was raised to eat vegetables and taught how to make them but it is true that most people on food stamps and other kinds of assistance arent buying vegetables
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fair enough i concede it was a lazy example my point is that there are veggies and fruits one can eat raw or from cans and still those dont get picked over biggulpmonsterslushie type of stuff that kind of stuff is just vile edit please see this wouldnt cost much more than a value meal or take more timeeffort than a drivethrough trip if you sub the expensive fruits with mass market apple banana oranges etc and the fancyish single serve yogurt with a scoop of noname brand big pack in a container it may be even cheaper i believe its not exactly time but sheer exhaustion and stress that propels people to bad food choices after a hard and stressful working day all will power is gone and the easy calories are what your heart craves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude i eat well when its possible but yeah congrats on knowing how to cook veggies and youre misrepresenting entirely how hard it is to cook meals a day you cant eat soup times a week sorry bruh or would you seriously have me believe thats what you do no no it isnt but go ahead and impose your ideals on others you hypocritical asshole rich people are retarded imma stay with that peasant bread life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,folks here constantly bitch about the rate hikes also nyc leadership actively discourages driving via laws not going to get into it while the public transit system has been worse than normal the past few months thank goodness i can drive to work and back home and not have to worry about the craziness that is nyc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes public transit was my main mode of transport from college onward its a lot cheaper than a car a monthly bus pass is less than just the insurance for a car i dont mind public transit i find it must more enjoyable than sitting in traffic i will admit its way better having a car for long trips groceries and most shopping experiences but youre less likely to over shop if you have to carry that shit home xd
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats in the category poorly maintained and bad regulation from my point of view
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just dont think southern california will ever fully embrace public transit seems like a cultural thing to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not a race issue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh elitist right because you must not ride a public bus on la streets nothing nice about it dont be so fast to call some one elitist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah so a big city right near the coast thats awesome that you have that there but cali changes in some big ways the further you travel down here in socal we have plenty of alternate means of travel too but like you theyre all near the coast east of la in the orange county and inland empire areas we dont have those kinds of travel options and they just get more sparse the farther you venture from the coast many people dont think about cali life outside of the big cities but its vast and it changes drastically alternative means of travel become significantly more less viable because while the jobs are are closer to the coast the cost of living gets cheaper the further you get from it so you are left with people doing huge daily commutes that they cant possibly complete due to the lack of bike or rail routes unless they take a car
UpliftingNews,not_removed,regular son
UpliftingNews,not_removed,many more cost efficient healthy ways though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure pots pans working stovesovens stuff like that is why i completely understand why like a low income family would prefer to just go to mickey ds its just so much easier
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you getting that in southern california if so which stores its at times more expensive here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow thank you for taking the time to type that out i guess it was silly to think that just by being california it would be more expensive i guess it makes a difference if youre the ones making the food though truth be told our oranges can get expensive pretty quick when theres a hit we send so many out i think were last in line and its a demand thing florida does its fair share of growing too and in almost twelve years ive not seen prices like that for a half dozen of those things i guess it comes down to where youre at if you can beat the national averages we go to stands rarely a farmers market because theyre crazy expensive produce only stores mom and pop ethnic grocery stores and the big name places like neighborhood market i will say potatoes arent as cheap by me but ive never seen them not be cheap pounds and pounds for a couple dollars and you can even get brown rice really cheap if you dont care about the brand our sale price on avocados though is a buck each red bell are and ive seen chicken breast that price three times in the last decade it doesnt take much to feel a hit were fifth in cattle production but ground chuck was at its peak when i started budgeting meals a decade ago it was literally half that if its something people eat a lot those multipliers can add up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its for farmers markets because we have a lot of food desert an area where fresh produce isnt available there are a lot of areas in south and east la with no supermarkets the carniceria will have some but often it is more expensive since the big markets wont come the farmers markets are being used to provide fresh produce to those areas another thing to consider is that when youre poor you dont have a lot of time to comparison shop or go to multiple stores im lucky im not doing great but i do have a big grocery store and two ethnic markets in walking distance too many areas in la dont even have the one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,excelllent example thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what magical land do you reside in where you can get cent avacados even in bulk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,chicken drumsticks cents a pound what year is this i buy drumsticks in the value pack on sale for a pound here in florida normally they are sheeeiiit everything on that list is anywhere from to times the price here in st pete avocados go from each peaches are on sale potatoes are for pounds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats maybe calories which is the minimum recommended for a sedentary adult man who is trying to lose weight its absolutely inadequate if youre doing any kind of manual labor as many low income people do maybe that diet could be sustainable for a month or three but in the long term its not its also deficient in several vitamins and minerals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,go out and eat day would be half of my budget in their scenario for dinner alone that said i dig batch cooking i used to cook for my family all the time so like people and there needed to be leftovers for peoples work lunches so if i do a stir fry i get dinners for days out of it i just have to rotate so i dont get sick of it or change up the seasonings i could eat well doing my dollars for breakfast for bread and for cheese and dollars for two pounds of nonintroublewiththegovernment actualfood lunchmeat so so far two tasty health family dinners run about bucks a pop but lets say conservatively its i am one person and even though i need to eat about twice as much as normal people to get half as many nutrients ill make two meals and switch back and forth to stretch them across the week another total another dinner into there is total cheaper than i thought breakfast helps bring that way down but up to as expensive as a dollar a meal in reality i snack like a motherfucker so my budget is off and has to account for that and my snacks are an average meal cost as i sit here and look at it but its nice to know its somewhat reasonable if youre wondering what an example of my ten dollar meals are i do get away with perunit pricing but im counting it since i regularly eat that stuff and incorporate it into as many of my meals as i can tolerateobviously if you only have a dollar you cant tear out a handful of chicken meat and just ask to pay for that if its a pound package
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eggs milk whole chicken greens coffee tea peanut butter bread dried beanslentils oats cabbage tuna pasta yogurt frozen vegetables etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope i approve but it wont do much except for those few people who actually need better food to be a little cheaoer to push them to buy not subsidizing crap would help more but no way that will happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its getting better there are some businesses on the outskirts of houston where i live that are close to the farm areas and take a step out of the job by preparing all the ingredients in the perfect amount with no waste and everything comes with easy directions at most your putting stuff in the oven or on the stove and its as easy as there are some also where you can get fully prepared meals think boston market but star quality ingredients so the familys that can afford this its a huge step
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except it does addressing basement costs means everything trickles up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well whoopdee fucking doo if only everyone could be a full time student with a full time job kids while also opening a farm and training for a marathon seriously though you sound insufferable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i stand by what i said i eat well i cook i buy fresh priorities or not decent food takes longer to prepare however marginal it may be and requires more frequent trips to the store since you cant bulk store it without additional labor both those things add up expense wise if you are already at poverty wage level like so many people are obviously if we all organized our time better this would be a nonissue but we are talking about those already least educated and most beaten down bu social ills if they were perfect little machines they would likely not be in poverty we get it you have it figured out the fact that i still feel like eating crappy wheaties some mornings instead of cutting up some fruit and cooking eggs though highlights why the worst off dont eat well even when they theoretically could if they you know lacked human flaws like relative laziness endless willpower and knowledge no one asked about your marathon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is just wrong a big mac is not inherently unhealthy it is a bit high in fat and low in carbohydrates compared to the ideal diet and it could contain more vegetables twice as much if it has to be really healthy but expecting each food item to be perfectly balanced is not reasonable but it fits in nicely in a balanced diet there is absolutely no basis for saying that consuming one by itself negatively affects our health the real problem is with the drinks where both the sodas and the milkshakes contain way too much sugar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was a ron swanson style joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cohesion without coherence try again please
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wasnt sure where to put this but ca is now has the largest economy in the world since the uk just recently tanked like thats gotta be worth something right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did he subsidize healthier food ie make it cheaper or try to restrict what people on assistance could buy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope havent you noticed the boxes of product behind them most constantly replenish with fresh stock throughout the day now if youre going for baked goods or my favorite tomato basil humus youre screwed if you dont go early
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sad but true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,here fruits the biggest thing hurting here is the weather not enough rain when it decides to rain it rains too much and in turn damages crops a lot of local farmers benefit directly from selling at farmers market you cut the middle man outstores and sell direct however of course the demand will never be as high and not everyone can produce enough to sell to companies here and there is not much but it does add up there is not specific cause for californias debtbut into this program hardly makes a difference california spends on average about per student on public education costsnot enough imo take a random county like san joaquin county total every year they spend over on students just used this as an example to show that spending on this program is nothing compared to common costs we pay for anyways i think education needs more moneybut thats something for another day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,include cleaning and shopping as well so i can make one stop for fast food on my way home and throw away the trash after or make a stop at the grocery store even if once a week then cook then clean any amount of time is more than would be required for take out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,minuets for a meal is quick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude i eat well when its possible but yeah congrats on knowing how to cook veggies and youre misrepresenting entirely how hard it is to cook meals a day i cook meals a day if you include cereal and sandwiches both of which are can be immensely healthier than fast food or junk food you cant eat soup times a week sorry bruh or would you seriously have me believe thats what you do no but the other day i grilled my sunday afternoon away and ate grilled chicken for weeks straight it was fucking glorious no no it isnt but go ahead and impose your ideals on others you hypocritical asshole 😂😂😂😂😂😂 rich people are retarded imma stay with that peasant bread life i know you are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well mta can suck my dick but thats a whole nother issue and hydrants and commercial vehicle only etc etc dont get me started on driving in nyc forget traffic and stupid drivers im just saying public transit isnt the worse thing in the world especially if its fairly efficient considering i depend on it most of the time for work where theres just no parking available its not that bad they can get over it and take the fucking bus or subway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,elitist p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have ridden the public bus in los angeles for several years yes its an elitist attitude you cant complain about traffic if you have an unreasonable phobia of public transit its not that bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,frozen vegetables are one of the most underrated foods theyre often on sale they dont spoil and theyre healthy without salt and preservatives my freezer is always full of them for when im in a hurry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is so cal the bastion of cheap living or something because that sounds too good to be true california grow of the country food that people actually eat other farming states are practically monocultures cornsoybeanpotatoes california berriesbroccolialmondsleekscabbageseverything else
UpliftingNews,not_removed,socal food is cheap people in this thread talking about cost of living in ca and then referencing food are numpties cost of living here is crazy but it has nothing to do with food unless you strictly go out to eat for meals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get your produce from one of them hispanic supermarkets which in socal theres plenty youll pay of what you pay at your average stater bros albertsons i still get my meats from stater bros whenever they go on sale though new york steak for a lb sometimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shop at food less or superior produce doesnt look as nice as albertsons but it tastes just as good i will say prices are more like rotating sales its unusual to find everything he listed on sale for that price at the same time but its still cheaper than stater bros
UpliftingNews,not_removed,irvine area first market is a localonly persian market second is sprouts which is a smallish chain that runs from at least la down to sd theres also two chinese markets and a korean one within miles or so all are fullsized grocery stores id say its the competition but sprouts sales are chainwide one thing we probably dont get for as cheap as other parts of the us is corn the best these days is for just a few years ago youd see for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,produce is grossly overpriced in larger chain grocery stores part of that is because they count on throwing away half of what they buy as spoiled but really its just not aesthetically pleasing to the average consumer my gf works in wholesale produce wholesale prices are far less than what you pay in raleysalbertsonsvonssafeway here are a few current wholesale prices from today of random products cavendish common bananas to per pound case to per pound depending on quality and ripening fresh express salad mixes to of to bags about per bag on average blood oranges per pound case minimum purchase from wholesale vendors is typically case and discounts are given for large purchases those are singlecase prices
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i spent months living in fl and was shocked at the high grocery prices a little research showed that they are the most expensive states for food while fl has a healthy agricultural sector a lot of what they grow is for export to other states citrus mainly much of their food is trucked in from other states
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats because those communities have driven them out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so cal im guessing the avocados are from mexico but they do grow very well in the area when i was growing up we had an avocado tree thatd sprout massive numbers of them every year when we had a dog that is when we didnt squirrels got them all by the time they were inch long
UpliftingNews,not_removed,still thats just dollars a week
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not american here so dont quite understand the situation your poorest live with but assuming thats doubling it would be for a week if youre assuming a thats hours of work to feed yourself for a week if you have a family youre fucked for sure but that is not what they did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously i would like some of these people spouting off how easy it is to eat healthy and cheap food to actually post legitimate healthy cheap meal plans they make it sound so easy like the meal plans could actually work for a working family long term also to add what kind of jobs will many of these poorer individuals be doing manual labor in many cases do people seriously think a diet consisting of chicken and carrots is going to support the nutritional needs of people doing hard work the simplistic answers barely hiding their disdain is too much for me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ya because frozen veggies are so great for us and the environment are we really arguing against making veggies cheaper this really needs to create incentives to enter and disrupt food deserts though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,none of the things the guy i responded to brought up had to do with cost i am all for cheaper food but this still didnt address any of the issues he brought up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cocaine is a hell of a drug
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at least he is doing something with his life rather than trying to tear others down for managing their time wellhaving drive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nine years ago i was homeless now ive got my shit together and ill be just as insufferable as i want i dont give one fuck if anyone is put off by it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no ones asked for any of our opinions on any of this were all just participating youre factually wrong in purporting healthy food is more troublesome or time consuming to prepare you can hard boil two dozen eggs in twenty minutes while you masturbate of shit or bicker with me here at almost up to you i do mine sunday evening poor food choice even when you justify it as youre too tiredbusywhatever is still just a bad choice eat wheaties theyre delicious i dont care but youre only lying to yourself if you honestly believe anything youve said justifies eating poorly even those terrible social ills youre allowed to eat poorly go for it but please ensure you have adequate health coverage as you age so that you dont take any of the limited resources available to those dealing with illnesses who are unable to afford healthcare without public assistance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and the other to pat each other on the back fees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cunt narcissistic personality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh sorry then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the latter but arent food stamps subsidies already
UpliftingNews,not_removed,peanut butter and jelly sandwich white bread is a loaf peanut butter and jelly is that will feed you multiple meals and the cleaning for it is cleaning a knife and maybe a plate you can eat it on a paper towel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,minutes is a lifetime after a hour work day cant tell you how often i just ate a sleeve of saltines and peanut butter instead of an actual dinner
UpliftingNews,not_removed,grilled chicken for weeks straight like some kind of tasteless robot eats better than me cool story bro my fried bread will be how i steal yo girl
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed yeah the mta wastes so much money and they want to raise tolls and fares get outta here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its still twice what op listed by the mexican super markets near me in so cal i dont know i have ever seen avocados under for no matter where i look here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everything i listed was in the sales flyers for this past week except for the generally theres more produce part the massive bulk foods like potatoes and rice are in big enough quantities that before i run out they go on sale again i didnt actually go to the store this week but often theres more on sale that didnt make the flyers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those neighborhoods have been disinvested in for decades and they arent going to get any better without some investment part of encouraging that investment is to bring in the farmers markets and enabling the population to shop there a decade ago the south central farm was evicted off the property when the original owner of the land decided he wanted it back hes left it an empty lot instead of bringing jobs like he had promised you cant just look at the kids coming up around there and say well some of your grandparents drove out the supermarkets so you dont get an apple heres some takis instead it doesnt solve the problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is hours per person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you realize that chicken and carrots are incredibly nutritionally dense right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reatcheapandhealthy check out their side bar tons of family meals extremely cheap and healthy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in what way are frozen veggies bad not that im arguing against making good food cheaper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you even being serious right now frozen vegetables are every bit as good for you as non frozen vegetables theyre cheaper and the carbon cost of freezing them is offset by the lack of spoilage leading to reduced hauling basically as long as you dont eat organic or non gmo food youre not harming the environment more by eating anything organic food is incredibly wasteful though and non gmo food is just selfish
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more like adderall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he is the one tearing people down not me hes just being passive aggressive about it honestly i dont give a fuck personally but lets at least call a spade a spade hes bragging about how awesome he is and telling people how to liveon an anonymous internet forum no less he knows fuck all about the people hes talking to yet hes patronizing them hes treating complete strangers like children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,congrats on getting your life together you still dont have to talk down to people like that youd think someone who was homeless would have a bit of empathy i guess you got it all figured out though good luck man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whoa man just because people treated you shitty in the past doesnt mean you can continue the cycle try being nice andor pleasant towards other people youll be surprised at how different the results will be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and nobody gives a fuck about your story your one in a million story doesnt mean shit to the poor people in food deserts getting robbed on the way home etc etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hmm i could wait minutes for some eggs to boil or i could pop a can of beefaroni in the microwave for minute seconds til minutes minutes math sure is crazy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry folks i just realized its a troll
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no worries
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes but giving people more incentives is preferable and more palatable than even more restrictions on people who are already suffering
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not as satisfying as a burger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yay lets feed the entire family pb and js constantly im sure that will go over really well cue the but my mom fed us rice and beans for a month and we were grateful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then you really need to concentrate on your health and even days that long can be better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you should look at page i think the majority of the us underestimate their california dependency i propose we should stop calling california a state but a country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,drive to fallbrook outside sd they sell huge bags of hass avocados for bucks on the side of the road bonus if you get a guy selling fuertes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,let me ask you something why do you think those businesses left in the first place you know the answer if you live here next question since those same reasons for leaving still exist who is going to be dumb enough to go back in there im not saying farmers markets are bad for those areas or that they shouldnt have grocery stores but you have to at least address the situation of why no businesses want to operate there before you start encouraging businesses to open back up there otherwise theyre just going to laugh at you and leave their empty lots jobless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but also relatively low calorie if youre doing hard labor you need those calories you could eat all the vitamins and minerals you want but that wont give your body glucose
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont see why you think pulling yourself from homelessness should create empathy for individuals who make excuses to avoid dealing with the embarrassingly trivial problems most of us have maybe im jaded but when i hear a sob story about why x is just so damn hard or y just isnt possible right now it better be a fucking good one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i keep hearing that from people who do a whole lot of ankle grabbing to get by in their personal and professional lives and they truly do just get by take this advice be stern direct and expect from others what you expect from yourself if someone doesnt meet your standard cut them from your life be nice to kids be honest with everyone else
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sure everyone was waiting for your opinion on this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then increase the amount of food stamps thats not a compelling argument for allowing them to be used on junk food as it stands right now the food stamp program is a huge subsidy for junk food companies i want that to stop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you now arguing that its hard to get calories i thought this whole thing started with people saying cheap food is higher in calories
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude you are a cliche you are the classic case of a person who has nothing and gets their life together and thinks they have life all figured out you have a massive ego and yet you still feel the need to put others down why is that if your life is so amazing where is this anger coming from you do realize that you are lashing out at strangers on the internet right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey i dont agree with your outlook on life but to each their own your advice is very solid advice regardless of what other disagreements we have sorry i jumped to conclusions yall didnt deserve baseless positing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like you dont listen to these people these are the type of people who are too lazy to get their shit together and like to find excuses keep doing what youre doing and never stop improving yourself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not a compelling argument for allowing them to be used on junk food of course it is poor people are still people with the same rights as everyone else they dont lose dignity or the right to make personal choices because theyre poor you can buy a hungry man dinner or a block of cheese with your food money so can they with their food money even if that food money is from the government feel free to make healthy options more affordable make the same of food stamp buy worth of healthier food but also still buy worth of convenient food someone working two jobs as a single parent doesnt necessarily have time to prep and clean and cook fresh food nor to need to go shopping every few days as fresh food spoils as it stands right now the food stamp program is a huge subsidy for junk food companies i want that to stop no its giving people who are hungry money for food your right to an opinion about what or how they eat ends there theyre not children and theyre not pets if you can buy a can of spaghettios so can they if you want to do something about how healthier food costs so much more per calorie than convenience foods feel free to tackle that problem for everyone not just the poor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the ones in dutch train stations have been very nice except for the pooping incident in amsterdam they bring random people together and make the station a happier place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh yeah just went through a few stations and noticed these figured they were always there without fail there was some random passenger killing it every time i walked past a lot of people are really dope at piano i guess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and all chinese parents rejoiced just kidding some of us had to learn an instrument that wasnt the piano
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in american cities with strong musicarts culture do you think this type of action would affect popular interest and use of public transit i would go out of my way for this myself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they cant hang one god damned guitar by a chain or some shit i dont play the fucking pianno lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nobody speaks about the amsterdam pooping incident not anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one of the downsides to piano is how unportable it is many instruments you could just bring id say that the most widely played musical instruments by adults not childrenteens in musicband are piano guitarbass and strings of some kind a source i just googled says it goes piano guitar violin drums sax flute cello clarinet trumpet harp but im not sure of accuracy guitar and violin are quite portable piano isnt at all unweighted keyboards play nothing like a piano plus require electric outlet and the lightest weighted keyboards weigh thats before any sound equipment etc of course theft would be a far bigger risk with smaller instruments and sound equipment you could bring your guitar or violin with you easy but you cant bring piano so its not comparable in fact people have played violin in subways source httpurbanlegendsaboutcomodmusicaviolinistmetrohtm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was just being silly but thanks for the info
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in the short term this would allow us to make carbon neutral fuels as what carbon we release into the atmosphere would be at most equal to the amount put into the fuel and then in the long term allow us easily capture carbon and get it out of the atmosphere once we can comfortably produce enough electricity without burning shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in short it has the potential to do no less than save the planet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also httpwwwborntoengineercomswisscommercialcarboncaptureplantsetopen sure environmentally this is great news and the engineering will only get better however this is also the beginning of a new green economy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man that looks cool too thank you for sharing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do people on reddit even know what navajo land is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trump will undo it using a feather quill pen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i do so one other for sure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,andy griffiths did it first ten years ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,amélie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that font in the book is horrid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a wonderful man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good men do exist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is my fiancé her father is an absolutely amazing man without him i can guarantee she wouldnt be the sweet and caring person she is honestly this isnt even close to the most heart warming story she has about him regardless im glad this had brought some attention to single fathers the are just as much champions as single mothers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck gender roles
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good people dont have gender
UpliftingNews,not_removed,her father is an absolute godsend one of the greatest men ive ever known
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed her father is amazing he helped out so much during band competitions and band camp she got a lot of him in her and you are a lucky guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the homemade backdrop makes it a very diy effort but the rap is actually catchy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a snooze fest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ekstra info ali sonko aged has been the main dishwasher at noma cph for years ali became world famous when noma was awarded the best restarurant in the world award in london and was supposed to accept the award on behalf of the restaurant however due to missing paperwork ali was not able to travel to london meaning that the award was accepted by founder rené redzepi and a strong delegation from noma all wearing tshirts with alis face printed on them when noma received the prestigious award for the third time in a row in ali was able to accept the award on behalf of the danish restaurant in london
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did eminem sponsor the bill
UpliftingNews,not_removed,could the government instead provide a set of permanent diapers to new families that would be a one time cost and it would be more environmentally friendly than disposable diapers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gasoline meet fire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i once saw a man arrested for shoplifting a box of diapers it was really heartbreaking i fully support this program
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no because people who are not welfare parasites will have to pay more for diapers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,access to washing facilities might be a problem though many people who live in apartments dont have a washing machine and have to go to a laundromat which can be expensive and is difficult without a car
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you want to send a card aaron stamper pea ridge rd in irvine kentucky edit forgot the postal code
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he is a beautiful looking boy im down to send him mail
UpliftingNews,not_removed,done
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks probably good to post that here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i also posted it on rassistance and randomactsofpostcards or something like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,may his giant mailbox be stuffed to the gills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awesome i was trying to find more subreddits for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hi matt maybe you can post it in rself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill do it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,done
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was a sweet promposal come on journalist come on horrible puns aside this an absolute feels trip what a great kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is just so heartwarming wonderful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,helping people break our laws is not uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how in hell is this uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they found him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ohbut the way this post is titled makes it seem a little boring and the opposite of uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people are donating to stand against islamiphobia but it will hasnt been established that this was arson itll be interesting to see what happens if it was determined to be accidental or a muslim arsonist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so he cut off his dreads so he could get a job and start donating to a womens shelter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dats a lotta dred
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the shelter is now in debt because of the fumigation costs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck men tho they dont need shelters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,imagine being in that situation youre the only one who can do something to save a life and in that course of action you could very well kill two including a child thats some immense pressure and outstanding bravery from this officer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,funny how that absolutely doesnt fit together with parents who both need to work and kids who stay at school or daycare all day and thats fucking everyone i know which isnt just a handfull this is so bullshit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,talk about a double edged sword
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not uplifting its sad parents are spending more time with their kids because theyre terrified and the kids have no time on their own either alone or with other kids but without adults we used to roam and play and discover and yes had some unpleasant outcomes but we learned
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i do not know how you drew this conclusion but i do find it positive and uplifting and this is what the author says the time parents spend with children is regarded as critical for positive cognitive behavioral and academic outcomes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good for you a balance of attention time and alone time is whats essential too much time with parents interferes with the individuation of personality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i understand that but will you consider minutes too much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,depends on what the time is spent doing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and how well adjusted would you say are the kids who are never alone never without the smothering embrace of mommy and daddy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so he could of faced criminal charges for doing this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,by oregon law keeping a wild animal without a permit is a class b misdemeanor with a potential fine of obviously this guy had no intention of keeping the animal he was just trying to save its life i think abcnewsgocom went a little overboard in its reporting here as i doubt charging him ever entered the wildlife officials mind but with everything else flooding the news sites these days between death and destruction in syria terror attacks around the world north korean nukes potomac political shenanigans and whatnot i found this story to be a warm reminder that there are good people in the world willing to do whats necessary to save the helpless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its either could have or couldve but never could of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i do feel like a warning is appropriate in this case httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqhdinibetii
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sikhs being sikh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sikhs are truly awesome people at least everyone i have ever met was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre always happy like they know something we dont
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you prefer not to click on daily mail sources then ive also autogenerated some potential alternative sources to this story here they may not be entirely accurate im trying to help so please dont ban me just downvote me i autodelete my comments with a score of or less i am a bot based on httpsgithubcombagmandmbot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for that because as far as im concerned the only time the daily mail should be associated with the word uplifting is the day that racist piece of shit paper closes for good edit damn you even removed the daily mail at the top of the screen shot fucking awesome love you bot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,remarkable recoveryand that smile
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pigs are so smart my favorite soccer player mario balotelli has a pet pig
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait he was gay omg rad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same thing happened to a family dog about years ago when we were saying our goodbyes my mother found a tick right between his eyes he lived another years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so what can this mean for graduates of itt specifically those that still owe to the school and their student loans
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not uplifting news and does not belong here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i should probably explain why this is here itt tech is essentially a scam school that preys on students taking on debt they know theyll default on to provide essentially worthless degrees they essentially sold themselves on being a careeroriented school but didnt give graduates the skills to get a career in the fields they promised their death means the end of one of the largest scam universities in the united states
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because the stories on here should move you to tears not be all about negativity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the multimillion dollar question wont those degrees be of less value if the school shuts down if theyre not already devalued due to this judgment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why not itt is notorious for being a scam school and encouraging students to take lots of loans that the school knows theyll default on under deceptive advertising practices and explicitly promising salaries and careers it cant pay out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is referring to the usfws endangered species list not the iucn redlist which is independent from political influence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is this because their population numbers have recovered or because everything else is losing protection fuck it nuke the manatees too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,first read this as florida man being removed from endangered species list glad to see they are still infact endangered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rfloridaman atee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,time to dump natural clean coal all over their environment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i remember when i was a kid and we went boating with a friend his boat had an alternate water propulsion system for manatee areas not sure if it was law but simpleyet pricey stuff like that helps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,brett keane
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how the fuck is this devastating blow to manatees to quote one if the sourced uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a few years in the future aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand its back on it again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is actually not uplifting news the manatee is definitely still in danger this just means there will be less protection less funding to save and less enforcement of protection laws for manatees this in my honest opinion is horrible news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not uplifting no way to believe in our current gov that this is due to population rebound vs greedy millionaires wanting to build developments or other ventures that would damage their habitats this just means we officially dont care about manatees anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yay sea cows theyre winning
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a floridian let me tell you this isnt good news for the manatee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is both incorrect and not good news the manatee is being downlisted from endangered threatened nor removed completely also this is a result of lobbying byb the boating industry not good science
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rconservation rrestorationecology
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mr president we are go for your huntingfishing trip
UpliftingNews,not_removed,looks like meat is back on the menu boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cue big grin by coastal developers and soon theyll be spearing manatees off maralago for sport
UpliftingNews,not_removed,isnt a wide swath of florida going to be inundated by rising sea levels in the next years theyre about to get a lot more habitat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,faith in humanatee restored
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a glorious situation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how long til he takes the credit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like to think its because of the one i sponsored when i was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now if we can only teach them to pollinate well bee all set
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive been dreaming of this day since i was years old
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for a moment i thought this was a post from rfloridaman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so can i ride one now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fake news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and being added to the extinct species list
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they probably just lowered the scale
UpliftingNews,not_removed,has been moved to the extinct list
UpliftingNews,not_removed,meats back on the menu boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can we eat them now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,family guy renewed for more seasons
UpliftingNews,not_removed,finally some good news for ops mom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my fondest memories of growing up in florida are the early mornings spent with my grandpa spear fishing for manatees im glad ill be able to enjoy that with my grandson too didnt think itd happen in my lifetime
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and then i ask myself corme orn gord
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nature coast here i have them in my back yard and am extremely fond of the critters in twenty years in fla i have never seen their population directly harmed by man i have seen cold winters combined with the flu wipe a quarter of the population out i did see the god awful winter of kill off about a third of them along with half the snook and tarpon but in just seven years they have come roaring back they are literally everywhere this year last year was a bumper crop of babies to put it mildly if you dont know the reason we have so many is we have fresh water springs that are actually the head waters of tributaries heading out into the gulf these waters stay degrees year around and when it gets cold they pack in shoulder to shoulder swimming with manatees is a major part of the nature coast economy its the only place in florida you can legally interact and yes some of them are like friendly dogs and just want a hug and their belly rubbed thats a belly so what will change from this not a thing there are rehab centers up and down the coast they are funded by tourism protecting them and ensuring their future is a huge industry most of the people that live here will freak on you if you mistreat one in the least so dont worry about the manatee they have lots of friends that love them and it isnt any government agency dont believe me next christmas break when you are freezing come on down put on a wet suit and give one a hug everyone should once
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so starving the manatee did not work brett keane is still alive and fat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can we eat them now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,looks like meats back on the menu boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to all the people thinking this is trumps evil plan to kill adorable animals you should know that the florida manatee population was down to in and now hovers around a percent increase according to the us fish and wildlife service recognizing this the government agency proposed a downgrade for their status and opened a public comment period on jan trumps inauguration was january do you think obama wanted to remove federal funding for regional environmental sciences edit formatting

UpliftingNews,not_removed,i could not help but read this as another florida man post way to go manatees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and the hunt begins
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant say florida manatee without florida man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida manatee arrested after hour riverboat chase
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sea cow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,socan we start eating them now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have been to the beaches in florida and can confirm that the manatees are abundant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeay manatee steaks are back on the menu
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have the florida man plugin for chrome you can imagine my surprise reading jeb bushatee being removed from the endangered species list
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the best news from florida ive heard in a while
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reading the comments has confirmed my suspicion manatees are still endangered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,manatees are so weird absolutely nothing about them makes any sense theyre friendly slow and they dont really do anything but float around all day theyre like the dodo of the sea im guessing they werent hunted to extinction because they dont taste good or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,looks like manatee is back on the menu boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well thats not good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they like to have orgies no joking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats total bullshit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,urf is love urf is life save the manatee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we did it jimmy buffet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hear a manatee that needs a hug
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder how global warming will affect the manatee if ocean waters stay warmer there will be less need for the manatee to come inland during the winter and avoid the hazards of being so close to humans but i believe they use the inland waters as breeding grounds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a friend of mine works for the us fish and wildlife service rescuing manatees they are being taken off the list from their success also no policies towards them have changed so the numbers will continue to recover this is such great news and all the negativity over political bs needs to stop the numbers are rebounding even in south carolina where i live there are so many manatees in sc now that they are being found in lake marion which means they have to swim through the locks of lake moultrie first
UpliftingNews,not_removed,op is your username a reference to wheel of fish
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry this is not uplifting news this is greed manatees is not enough money talks and politicians are listening
UpliftingNews,not_removed,read it as florida man was very confused
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not for long
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yet another win for the majestic sea burrito
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can we ride em now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are beautiful creatures glad to hear theyre recovering cant wait to hunt them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh boy here i go killin again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anyone know some good recipes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,urf
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is terrible news there are only a few thousand manatees and the vast majority that ive seen bear scars from boat rudders even the young ones this is only being passed so that florida can relax boating and coastal development restrictions despicable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah whatever sea cow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im glad people managed to save the albino sea turds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,means we can eat them now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this sums up how i feel about this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awesome im going to floor it in my motorboat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does this mean we can ride one like a seadoo again without being fined or incarcerated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this isnt actually uplifting news this is economicpolitically motivated so that restrictions on development can be expanded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it just me or does the thumbnail look like a galaxy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,looks like meats back on the menu boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the thumbnail looks like an eyerolling grey blob
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought i was in rfloridaman for a second
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mmm manatee burgers get my gun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does this mean we can ride them now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,under new trump us executive action to add a species to the endangered list you must first take one off as these are regulations and im not kidding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now if we could get get women off the endangered species list life would cease to be laughable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its always a florida manatee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did amy shumer finally breed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,manatees are amazing my dad has some amazing stories about them he calls them water cows they are extremely friendly he was fishing waist deep in a cove and one swam right up to him and rolled on its back he sat there nudging my dad every few seconds youre not supposed to touch manatees my dad eventually gave in and rubbed its belly until it was content and swam away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can we start hunting them then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who manatee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fantastic news always wanted to have me a nice juicy manatee steak
UpliftingNews,not_removed,break out the harpoons
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i found the rebounding manatee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,way to go florida manatee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill grab my shotgun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sea beef burgers for everyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a floridian this makes me so fucking happy to see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they been seen all up and down the east coast the last few months
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am excited to see how florida man reacts to this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,time to start killin em again daddy needs a new rug yeeehaaaaww
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it time for manatee hunting season then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sea cow fat ass
UpliftingNews,not_removed,figure out a way to turn these critters into tasty burgers and the ranchers will solve your endangered problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is by scientists right this isnt like an eo because trump wants to eat manatees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,instead of removing species from any of these endangered lists maybe we should add all species to it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because it is now extinct
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most worthless fucking animals on the planet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,useful links httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwestindianmanatee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well fuck you and your list
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are listed as vulnerable by the iucn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats true but we dont know how abundant manatees were back before we stared recording this type of thing at this point in time there is more than there have ever been in the history of recording them so we truly do not know if they originally had lower numbers prior to becoming an endangered species
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was wondering if it was just political pandering or the species was actually safe thanks for looking it up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this means i still cant eat them right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a really big real estate company wants to build condos on protected land so they lobbied to have manatees taken off the list source i live here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol independent of political influence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youve got it reversed the iucn red list is far more politicial than the usfws status one has a legal standard that can be enforced through the courts and the other is voted on by a committee that is incredibly political ive been to two iucn meetings and the one that had the bluefin tuna come up there was bribery at a level that would embarrass the mob sure there are scientists there at the listing meetings but each countrys voting rep is a diplomat or politician not a scientist and votes are regularly bought and sold for development aid and outright bribes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,floridian here i kayak and spend a fair amount of time on the water and manatee sightings are always exciting and have become a lot more common in recent years theyre not the rarely seen creature that they once were and thats a wonderful thing i spot them several times a year now where i live in the tampa area i once spoke to a guy who is a biologist for florida fish wildlife and hes said that yes theyve rebounded into a nice population that numbers in the thousands now but save the manatee is also a bit of a cottage industry here as well there are groups who rely on donations fundraising and selling manatee merchandise who do good work but are afraid that this will harm those efforts because the public just might not see their cause as worthy anymore if its no longer an endangered animal personally i dont see florida easing boating regulations anytime soon or doing anything else that would cause a reverse of this trend the manatee is an animal thats really weaved itself into florida culture down here there are no wake manatee zone signs in nearly every inshore waterway and most responsible boaters and sports fisherman respect that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my guess is its a way to remove federal funding for regional environmental sciences
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gotta nuke something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,depending on the tide we have manatees in the canal often definitely up from what it was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,from what ive understood they are recovering but not quite as numerous as they should be yet and to be honest theyre big dopes in all likelihood theyll be back on it soon because they want to go hug people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not sure what protection plans play into this also but manatees require very warm water to survive and florida is the edge of where they can exist temperature wise with the warming if watersdue to climate change manatees are surviving winters more easily and therefore their numbers are rising again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its the latter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh man so funny
UpliftingNews,not_removed,let the hunt begin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks trump
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah we are s nuclear heavy state
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not law but it is these kinds of things that have helped the manatee population recover and flourish once again there are idle speedno wake zones in manatee areas and they are heavily enforced sounds like your friend had a motor that uses both propellor propulsion and jet propulsion the props are dangerous to the manatees since they float near the surface you can cause serious damage going over them at high speeds i still see manatees all the time with large propeller scars on their backs sauce central floridian
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everytime anything manatee related comes up i always look for the keane reference
UpliftingNews,not_removed,situation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly the article is pretty clear that removing them is a bad idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its uplifting because manatees contribute to sea level rise by displacing water by removing them from federal protection we are saving costal area
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not a devastating blow they are everywhere in south florida these days we even have them in the st lucie river calooshatchee river kissimmee river and the meeting point for all three of those rivers lake okeechobee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you read the article its symbolic so they can pat themselves on the back nothing changes as far as protections or enforcement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i live in the manatees winter spa they are not only loved and protected by people here but we go to great lengths to kill any big development that pops up go build your mega hotel on the atlantic the greatest threat to manatees are city folks that drag their lake boat here and run like they do on their lake back home they just dont know how to operate around them or they dont care and they hurt them every now and then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the obama administration started the process for removing them from the endangered list a few months ago is obama a greedy millionaire the manatee population has increased since
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can i get a moo moo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah not winning this is a political thing so that rich folks can drive heir yachts faster and not get in trouble for accidentally killing manatees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the article states its symbolic and nothing will change how does this help the boating industry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obama is a hunter i never knew that he started this process some months ago and i was curious why hunting trips in florida postwhite house eh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i ask myself come orn gord
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems like people stopped attacking their families
UpliftingNews,not_removed,happy twelfth birthday
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no but you can pet one of it approaches you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,manatees back on the menu boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can you take some of ours the numbers were huge this year an hour north of tampa
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre no longer endangered how do you feel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no theyre like sea bass but better melts in your mouth like butter you could get it at certain restaurants if you knew what code word to ask for and were willing to pay the price now well finally be able to get it at the fish store
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you used to be able to get manatee in restaurants it was like pork im told
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks bro have a schlitz and some fried manatee fingers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they do taste good unfortunately
UpliftingNews,not_removed,looks like meats back on the menu boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youuuuuu cheeky lil
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im upbeat looking at one in my back yard right now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,too fatty to have good quality meat a friend of mine ate orca and described it as really greasy beef
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the rumor was they are insanely tasty and thats why they really dwindled to such low numbers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its by shill scientists who are interested in benefiting their donators theyre still on the global endangered species list that is exempt from political pressure and this is a bad thing that will harm their habitat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hard to tell which it is since this was all started under obama
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then what would be the point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then what would be the point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then what would be the point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then what would be the point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the us list is politically biased lots of funding for animals on that list of im not mistaken
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lots of wealthy people have big yachts in florida those boats grind up sea cows like the one in this picture into sea hamburgers many environmentalists say sea cows are endangered and need protection other environmentalists take cash from the rich yacht owners and state there are more than enough sea cows and that yachts can sail around anywhere they please it turns out that lots of wealthy people care more about how fast they are allowed to go in their yachts than whether your children live in a world that still has sea cows
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dramatically clicks pen you just made the list
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no theyre listed as endangered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,makes sense about it becoming a local industry and i could totally imagine folks being worried their cause will go by the wayside hopefully those people put their effort into some other worthy cause good to hear that manatee conservation has worked its way into florida culture here in canada we only seem to get those a florida man has been arrester after insert insane hijinks here kinda stories gotta ask do people in north florida really talk like farmer fran from waterboy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most responsible boaters and sports fisherman respect that this is the key
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fellow floridian here i grew up in crystal river florida where a couple of decades now was one of the only places where these guys were found i also live in tampa now but i havent seen any since moving here almost every time i go home and head out on the water you can find some of them hanging out and its a great thing knowing they are beginning to thrive again from what i can tell in my hometown the push to have these guys reclassified is coming from the local marine industry dock builders commercial fisherman etc are hindered by the environmental protections afforded to these guys but to be honest i dont care there is so much natural beauty in my home town still to this day and i have always believed that the manatees are a major reason why
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a fellow tampanian and kayaker i have to agree that seeing manatees is always a big deal for me even though i do see them fairly regularly you also mention responsible boaters expecting the no wake manatee zone signs but ive had to wave too many down to warn them about a nearby manatee because they are speeding up a channel and dont notice them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh yes they will be rolling back the speed zones theyve been pushing for it for years now especially in south florida well put them back on the list damnit they dont get away that easily
UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida springs and mangrove forests have always fascinated me high on the list of things i want to see it must have been pure paradise when the first settlers discovered it a centuries ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,other floridian here orlando checking in ive never seen a manatee they are still endangered in my city
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in the thousands you say wow i hope the govt keeps the numbers in check else theyll go for world domination with those kinds of numbers s seriously any animal short of hundreds of thousands needs to go on the list
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are really cool animals i remember one swimming up to me while i was on a beach and i dont think ive ever moved so fast to get out of the water people laughed at me and told me they were gentle and called them sea cows still extremely intimidating looking when youre up close though glad to hear theyre rebounding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have yet to see a manatee that hasnt been injured by boat motor props in most cases there are several spots on the manatee from multiple accidents the no wake zones probably help to not cause fatal injuries but i dont believe it is enough protection it is one thing that the populations have increased but quite another if the manatees are consistently injured
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this initiative began years ago and was published in the federal register under obama
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe take seconds to google something before replying to a question you know nothing about the florida manatee population was down to in and now hovers around a percent increase according to the us fish and wildlife service recognizing this the government agency proposed a downgrade for their status and opened a public comment period on jan trumps inauguration was january so it was the obama administration that has the idea to remove manatees from the endangered list do you think obama wanted to remove federal funding for regional environmental sciences
UpliftingNews,not_removed,touché
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the old salts that have been here on the nature coast their whole lives say there have never been anywhere near this many some also say that in the they didnt come winter in places that they do now then learned new behaviors i think this will happen again because the huge amount of people swimming with them in crystal river will make them go somewhere else like my backyard two there right now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no its not removing the manatees from the endangered list was first publicly proposed while obama was still president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we still use a lot of httpfloridaenergyufledufloridaenergyfacts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive never seen a manatee that didnt have scars on its back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like your friend had a motor that uses both propellor propulsion and jet propulsion yeah i meant he turned the propellers off and swapped to water propulsion in those areas not that it was a non propeller boat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre unfortunately not enforced at all here in miami broward west palm and others do a great job however in miami the police dont seem to give a rats ass the fwc is incredibly understaffed its very frustrating to watch a boat haul ass through a manatee zone and know they will never get theirs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im on the water a lot around them this whole place is an idle zone and its enforced stringently i yell at people all the time and tell them to slow the fuck down i dont give a rip they usually slow right down locals putt around with their motors tilted up till the cav plate is just under water im sure ive never hit one they are not hard to see most people are really good about it and try to protect them its just that one percent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rkenm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck you lived on the water for years now i see just as many people racing through manatee zones on john boats and small fishing boats as yachts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,protections for endangered species are regulated by law for threatened species they are specially crafted boating industrylobby hates all of the slow speed zones that cover southern florida step lobby for downlisting step come back next year and argue if manatees are not in danger of extinction speed limits should be changed or removed its a longterm strategy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,please do not touch manatees and dont spread this misinformation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i mean i heard if they bite you or something they can be poisonous to you im pretty skeptical of it and probably read it somewhere online and got bamboozled just was wondering if someone in here could confirm or deny
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre like pork it was common to get them in restaurants years ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are they allowed to be farmed i highly doubt it as theyre very regulated if something is tasty of course theyll dwindle if youre not allowed to farm them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,protections wont change how does this harm them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the point would be to prove that one species is destroying all other other species
UpliftingNews,not_removed,manatees being taken off will open up alot of their habitat to coastal development this is actually the opposite of uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well removing it from the list might just be because they want to free up some of those funds for species that are more endangered and havent had a ton of presspolicy already passed to protect them to be fair though doing population studies of marine animals is always pretty tricky so maybe the usfws and iucn looked at conflicting data
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which ones so i can know they arent really endangered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so they were removed from the list because of all the manatees now sitting in political positions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or there are tons of wealthy people who live on the water that pump money into protecting the manatee so the speed limits stick around that way their gigantic yacht parked outside of there house doesnt get slammed up against a bulkhead still about rich people but i dont think everyone knows where the money is coming from big boats dont normally go into these guys habits next time you are on the intercoastal look around when you hit a manatee zone should be a few big houses around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why cant they put a cage around the propellers to protect sealife
UpliftingNews,not_removed,big yachts are not going into the manatee habitats smaller boats of which many do go into the rivers where manatees tend to chill out are just as capable of tearing up a manatee and fishing nets can tangle them up and cut into them as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,drink it in maaaaaan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stupid idiot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my bad someone needs to update the wikipedia page
UpliftingNews,not_removed,floridian here lived in florida all of my life years and i can assure you we have some of the best people here not to mention all of the beaches wildlife theme parks professional and college sports as well as a culture of laid back southern hospitality the reason for all of the crazy florida man stories is that florida is one of the only if not the only state that makes criminal arrest report details public before during and after a person goes to trial so its not that the only crazy shit that happens is always in florida but rather that you hear about it more often i dont mind it to be honest because if people think were crazy and want to stay away then so be it we have enough tourists here as it is ill keep my beaches and beautiful women and weather you all can have the rest and to answer your question yes they all talk like farmer fran s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,born in orlando florida moved away thank god then revisited in fort myers for six months im gonna be honest florida is generally boring if not for the tourist traps and beaches but if you actually get to places like sanibel or the hot springs its worth while and uniquely beautiful hell even a car ride through the everglades was astounding when a gator nearly outpaced my car in the spill and was at least three feet longer than my my car my point is florida is mostly great for its unique wildlife and ecosystems otherwise it feels like an armpit ie hot sweaty smelly and chock full of undesirables
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive lived in nw florida most of my life and i can assure you that nobody here talks like farmer fran that ive ever heard to be fair farmer fran was cajun and lived in louisiana right i totally get the florida arrests thing though i cant count the number of times i smh when i hear or read a piece of news where someone has been arrested only to hear florida as the origin state everytime i hear one which is literally about every other day i listen closely till i hear florida then i wonder how i didnt know already p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you really believe that all people from florida are like that what community can you say every person is a certain way florida is just like every other state where people are diverse from mental issues to doctors or whatever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have you done crystal river yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh my parents have a waterfront house in south florida manatee regulations turned a minute boat ride to the gulf of mexico into minutes of idling with a few bursts up to mph itd be like if you were on the highway but had parking lot speeds it made a severe impact on their ability to boat i dont have a let nature burn mentality weve got to protect nature but it must also be balanced with human needs and desires all of this is separate from the fact that some propulsion systems jet drives dont pose a risk to manatees anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh i live right outside the everglades and i think that the original settlers were fucking lunatics the bugs must have been out of control and the heat must have been unbearable modern amenities make florida kick ass but i dont go hiking in the woods without bug spray and i sold my old car which was perfectly fine other than lacking ac for a car which had ac if you look at the population of fl over time youll notice the state became more populated when things like ac and bug control became a thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida was the opposite of a paradise until they invented air conditioning mosquitos humidity and palm frons that will cut you like a razor in every direction the place was mostly swamp no thanks the early settlers were nuts to stick around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when the spanish explorer ponce de leon settled here in the early he was rumored to also be looking for the fountain of youth it is said that he stumbled across the many natural springs here and thought he had actually found it fun fact st augustine is the oldest city in the united states the original fortifications from the are still standing today and you can go there and see them cool stuff if youre into that kinda thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i spent years in florida coolest thing i did in that state was swim with the manatees crystal river they come in to breed in the winter the river is a spring river and the water is warmer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,complain to sea world maybe they will put some in tiny cages and force them to give people rides
UpliftingNews,not_removed,andkeep in mind the horrible winter of killed about half of the gulf population and they are just everywhere this year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im talking about before that around that time is when we saw a decline due to boating before we started recording anything like thisearly and so on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you have a source for this and who proposed that while obama was still president i can only assume youre talking about floridas shitbag governor who also denies climate change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no you can make this claim when they take mangroves off the list but manatees hold up no development
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i figured they would fuck us somehow for speed limits to change is that a fwc change or goes through legislature im sure there would be a huge outcry if they try to change any of the protections we damn sure dont need boats mowing them down again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about when they come up to you and bonk you with their head and then roll over for you to scratch their belly cause they do that especially the huge ones of course this is only in citrus county where manatee swims is a huge part of the economy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not misinformation you are allowed to touch them if they approach you you are not allowed to chase pester harass or approach them if they engage you than your fine two hands are illegal the endangered species act forbids touching a manatee unless it touches you first and they will let you know the rules are strict in homosassa and the protection of this endangered species is taken very seriously there is absolutely no chasing riding or harassing the manateesjan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is not true they evolved with no natural predators so they never developed like any defense mechanisms thats why theyre so damn slow also theyre herbivores and have those flat grindy herbivore teeth so itd be pretty tough for them to bite anybody in the first place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,funding easier chances to deregulate habitats and develop just because protections dont change now doesnt mean this hasnt made it easier for them to change down the line this is simply removing a deadbolt doesnt matter if no one opens the door yet it makes the house of protections less secure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you i was going to say this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if it makes you feel better i live in florida and you can swim with a lot of manatees here in the rivers and stuff i know it doesnt make them any less endangered but at least theyre not scarce as fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is there a rdepressingmasqueradingasupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,manatee protection does very little to impede coastal development in florida i am a florida land use attorney what it does do is protect grassland habitat and migration zones but those are aquatic preserves not upland ones so you are right that the fdep may be forced to allow new marina development as far as adding more docks and slips and may have an impact on underwater seegrass habitats which serve all kinds of important functions other than grazing for seacows but it will not stop coastal development sealevel rise is going to punish those who decide to build too close to the water soon enough and i will have little sympathy if you want to stop coastal development in florida then we need one of those border walls built along the floridageorgia line or maybe global warming will bring malaria back and that will scare all the transplants back north the biggest risk to manatees are idiots and drunk people on boats hopefully basic safety concerns will be enough of a reason to keep many of the current restrictions in place but i am not going to hold my breath like there is anything wrong with moving at idle speed and enjoying your surroundings but i am a sailor and for us knots is fast
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is this why they are endangered or are people eating them and what do they taste like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,floridas coast is already packed to the brim with development developers are looking inwards for projects land east of and west of is being bought up like crazy source am land owner
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nailed it thats the spin doctors trying to pull another fast one us by disguising it as a good thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well its our planet first the privilege of being the dominant species
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was so excited when i saw the post at first now im very sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly they want to drill off the coast of fl now theyre one step closer also and im so sorry but a lot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck it never ends with the money trail
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but environmental groups argue the rebound comes along with a growing number of manatee deaths particularly from boat strikes and that the manatees fate remains uncertain there is for instance a growing trend by manatees to huddle during cooler winter months in artificial habitats created by power plants if those shut down there could be major losses we believe this is a devastating blow to manatees patrick rose executive director for save the manatee club said in a statement a federal reclassification at this time will seriously undermine the chances of securing the manatees long term survival
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i get your point but removing an atrisk species from the list just so other ones have better access to funding is still pretty politically motivated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha more endangered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not like iucn and usfws did a simultaneous review and came up with different conclusions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more like boaters in florida hate the speed limit imposed on intercoastal waterways due to manatee habitats
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the speed zones are repelled if they are no longer endangeredi work in a manatee zone once the speed is upped so does the manatee death and injury rate with less consequences if you do hit one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,during the times of year that manatees migrate they are most definitely in areas where big yachts navigate which is why some manatee zones are only in effect for a set period of time not all rich people are jerks and many are environmentalists but even some of them that have boats have killed or maimed a manatee other than banning propellers they will always be at risk when boats are in the water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it would reduce efficiency significantly suddenly boaters are using more fuel and everyone is now worried about birds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they do but its not that simple screw it up and your boat runs like crap and its a danger to everyone because now it doesnt handle well really just throwing hunks of metal on the bottom of a boat really screws with them hell even on a well designed boat you may have to switch around different prop types to stop the cavitation prop basically creating bubblesair pockets around the blade essentially making the prop spin in air while underwater also its argued how effective those cages are it isnt always the spinning blades that do the damage a lot of modern boat motors have a sharp metal fin that extends a foot below the prop that will slice into flesh if hit at any speedsa cage would just bludgeon or still gash them up at knots httpwwwpropellersafetycompropellerguarddesigntradeoffs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,atee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pen scratching intensifies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there isnt a wiki page that i could find for florida manatee which is i think a subspecies of the west indian which as a whole is listed as vulnerable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hilarious news stories or no id love to go fishing in florida some time thanks for confirming the farmer fran debate s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,beautiful women beaches and weather indeed not sure what part of florida youre in but i live on the emerald coast with the beautiful white sand beaches its no wonder there are so many tourists here cuz i sure wouldnt trade it for anything but damn are they annoying if they learned how to drive at a speed higher than half the speed limit not an exaggeration then maybe i could tolerate them a little more p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,speaking of crazy im watching a video of an alligator trainer in fl belly flopping into the water with the gators ironic haha but in all seriousness my family has been going to the naplesmarco island area since i was young and id move there in a hot minute if the situation presented itself my only complaint about fl is those damn palmettos no matter how many times ive seen them they still scare the ever loving shit out of me jungle bugs shudder edit yeah about manatees manatees are amazing creatures theyre so chill when i was younger i went on one of those tourist manatee tours through the mangroves and one of the baby cows actually came up right next to my jet ski and i reached out and touched it one of the coolest experiences ever theyre sweet always save the manatees endangered or not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your weather sucks humid as fuck then it rains then its hot and humid again im from from minnesota our weather sucks too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some of the best people here as a fellow floridian since the late im going to have to disagree lived in other parts of the nation for school and work and some of the worst this nation has to offer is in this state i remember being confused as to what a pain clinic is as i had never seen one anywhere else in the country or why there was in the same block when i first moved to broward county i just assumed maybe there was more pain sufferers in ft lauderdale than anywhere else in america or why palm beach county sheriffs department drug sniffing dogs were searching the parking lot of my super affluent high school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think you have to have a love of the outdoors to truly love this state that or a deep and abiding hatred of cold weather
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a point ive been making for years to people some other guy in this post was completely trashing florida because he didnt like all of the pain clinics he saw while living in broward county that would be like me saying all of michigan is a shithole because i used to live in innercity detroit ive lived in florida almost thirty years and i hate orlando too touristy overcrowded and omg the fucking traffic southern florida along the east coast is the same way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hold on now nature coast here how many of those people that get arrested in all the stupid crap are transplants from somewhere else heck im not sure i even know any natives im an okie but aint been arrested yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i havent gone that far north yet i usually kayak around honeymoon island cockroach bay wernerboyce salt springs and the skyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,too many tourist go to homosassa plus you have monkey island what else you want
UpliftingNews,not_removed,days without power after wilma i wanted to die the sound of a generator sends me into a rage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if the glassclear springs and their friendly water cows have been extra attractive when the first people came upon them from the damp insectrich swamps or maybe theres just as bad on the coast and along crystal springs banks it is always exciting to hear firsthand experience from around the world btw there should almost be a sub r a moment on earth or something like that ppl could describe their small part of the world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant imagine how they lived here between the deer flies and noseeums not for me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plis dont refer to ops mom that way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive been to orlando a few times plenty of land manatees present there is some kind of independent helping program to keep them alive where they are given scooters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you assume incorrectly it was the us fish and wildlife service which is a federal agency the florida manatee population was down to in and now hovers around a percent increase according to the us fish and wildlife service recognizing this the government agency proposed a downgrade for their status and opened a public comment period on jan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you should do less assuming
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know this works in my home county of citrus where the manatees originate part of the reason the laws are so uniformly followed here is because of civilian enforcement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre aware manatees dont just live near mangroves right the push to remove manatees from the endangered list started in with pressure from boating and development groups
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i see them fat assses swimming through the intercoastal all the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes but the important fact is that their presence here and their presence on the list provide a lot of regulations that protect them and our waterways no more endangered manatees no more no wake zones to protect manatees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can you pet them while swimming do they bite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how does coastal insurance hurt development of that nature in florida in nc most private insurances the big ones anyways wont insure coastal developments because they cant safely insure it to a legal limit so most of the coastal insurance is done through the state is it a similar situation there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so you are right that the fdep may be forced to allow new marina development as far as adding more docks and slips and may have an impact on underwater seegrass habitats which serve all kinds of important functions other than grazing for seacows why would fdep be forced to do anything as a result of a change in federal regs the agency most likely to be impacted by this is acoe but if protections arent changed then not much effect to federal agencies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i bet they taste good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im normally skeptical of taking the comment of a person who represents a community that would be adversely affected by a decision like this but in the article they also mention the decision was made with outdated data on the manatee deaths although an increase in deaths alone isnt enough to prevent the change in clarification id argue that part of what influenced their decision to move it to threatened was based on the rate of recovery that is well known if the population is growing and healthy then theyre not actually in danger of going extinct just threatened its important to use current data but its also important to make sure the assessment of their condition reflects the actual status it seems like usfws was convinced of that although well see if they make a new study and reevaluate things theres no obvious political reason for them to upgrade their status so its a bit tin foil hatty for people in this thread to jump straight to that conclusion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,before the power plants manatees would and still do migrate to spring heads that are degrees all year long to stay warm its pretty awesome to see if you go to one of the parks at the right time of year one of the benefits of a warming planet might be that manatees will no longer be threatened by the occasional freeze down here as long as something else related to climate change like disease or loss of seagrass doesnt kill them anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,women and penguins first
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not political though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol i thought about saying more in danger but that homonym was too good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah ive heard they can be kind of annoying its important to remember that they help make the ecosystem more robust though by eating vegetation that keeps fish healthy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they probably think you are annoying asf when you are out riding at high speed around their homes also
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boater and fisherman here the limits do suck but blowing up your engine by hitting a manatee sucks too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more like manatee awareness and education has lead to the population exploding in the last decade population numbers have more than tripled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does this mean that it will also be less illegal to attempt to ride a manatee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok thanks for the explanation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i went on a manatee trip on crystal river years ago the boat captain said that manatees closest relatives are elephants and that they have the same attitude as eles re not getting out of the way of things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you should high tide is at two thirty come on its snook season
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no problem sir we have some of the best fishing around here some of the most fun ive ever had on a boat was hooking my first tarpon really great salt and fresh water angling i hope you get to come down here someday and find out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,saw a bumper sticker yesterday that said if its tourist season why cant we shoot them and my first thought was of all the vans with michigan license plates toddling down the highway at fifteen under the speed limit its definitely inspired murderous ideas in me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can confirm you never get used to seeing palmetto bugs i scream like a girl when one of those suckers jumps off a wall and starts flying around glad you liked it here come back and visit sometime soon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fair point however id pick rainy and humid over degree blizzards any day but maybe that is because i am just more conditioned to it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are pain clinics everywhere ive gone to them here in california as well my back is super fucked due to scoliosis and spinal fusion they arent just pill mills they usually also do things like steroid injections into the jointsspine for pain relief that can last months spinal cord stimulators that reduce pain discectomies for people with bulging discs etc not to say there are no shady clinics but if youve never heard of them elsewhere its just because youve never needed to go to one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you live in s florida you are in new sau paulo move back to murica
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lived in other parts of the nation for school and work and some of the worst this nation has to offer is in this state couldnt disagree more broward county has some of the worst this state and country has to offer i could be wrong but it sounds like youre judging an entire state by your experience of living in the worst part of that state that would be like me saying michigan is a shit hole because of my experience living in detroit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like the outdoors ive hiked throughout the state gone camping and canoeing but i think everything but the beaches is better elsewhere in the country it could be people hate cold weather like you said or that people not from florida find yearround beach weather and palm trees exotic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very legitimate question but many that are getting arrested in my area are younger and were born here there are probably many that spawned elsewhere though the latter is definitely more likely the case around spring break and summer however
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah it is getting to be that time of year where crystal river is a shit show still worth visiting at least once though three sisters is nice if youve never been there before i know of a few other off the map places in and around homosassachassahowitzkacrystal river area that are great for avoiding the locals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well if they had monkeys riding them in little wet suits im right there with ya
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure they do every intercoastal is lined with mangroves and manatees frequent the intercoastal year round do you even live in florida
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not neat at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre honestly really cool animals i swam with some in wikiwachi where the water is dark i was scared as fuck when they swam up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which intercoastal the only time i have seen manatees up close is when i go kayaking through state parks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no those are just floridians sadly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ft isnt that far away if i was away from a manatee i would still tell everyone i swam with one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres no way the locals will let them take away the manatee regulations regardless especially in st petersburg area
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they just kind of swim around you im assuming the people that live along the area throw them lettuce so yeah you can pet them and theyre pretty gentle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think youre even allowed to be near one much less touch them when i went to one of the parks there were signs warning to not touch the animals and to not approach them if they swam into the roped area we were swimming in you were to let them pass but to answer the other question they pretty much were like cows they just swam lazily thru the area i dont think they bite but they are pretty large so youd have to be careful around that much weight in the water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes we have the same situation here although from what ive heard its worse in nc costwise the only effect its had down here is making it impossible for anyone but the super rich to buy coastal property and given the super rich something else to bitch about i had a client once complain to me about the cost of insurance in the same conversation he showed me pictures of the new plus mercedes he had just bought with cash i had to use all of my will power to keep a professional expression on my face
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are right and i should have said fdep and acoe since both agencies play in a role in dock and marina permitting especially on the icww however the political structure in tallahassee is not far out of line of what is in washington right now so if the esa is changed then it will not surprise me if the state agencies take the baton and run with it changes in protected species and critical habitat designations can have a ripple effect that being said i dont think it is going to result in all of the signs and manatee protection plans implemented by fdep and ffwcc will change my original point is that this is not going to open the door on more coastal development except maybe more docks that door was kicked in and set on fire a long time ago if it ever existed at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,however given both the state and the federal governments current antiscience stance it is just as strange to trust them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is an obvious political reason opening up their currently previously protected coastal habitats to development that wouldnt have been possible while the animals were on the usfws endangered list
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the problem we have hear is algae blooms clouding up the water theres a big effort to introduce more oysters to filter it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thought it was just the prop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,blowing up your engine sucks more than hurting a living being okay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,certainly true but only because of that and speed limits take that away and who knows what will happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea thats cos there are speed limits on boats at the moment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,almost like there are laws in place that reduce the number of deaths due to boats hmmm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know exactly what you mean in my area ive seen a lot more texas plates this year than any other state
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats an old joke we say that one here in victoria
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id hyperventilate hahahaha those things scare the shit out of me will be there this summer after an unfortunate couple years away i cannot wait
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i respect your opinion spend a year here though you might love it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know you and i are not arguing about the same thing as evident by your passive aggressive response to my original reply as i was criticizing the documented lax position the state of florida took against pill mills and you took offense to it as you stated you need opiates for your quality of life perhaps you never lived in broward county in the late to mid perhaps you never seen billboards advertising no wait pain clinics perhaps you never saw to on your way to school with on the same block perhaps you never saw people on the side of the road waving signs for pain clinics perhaps your local news station didnt air a series on how the state of florida was resisting bush administration dea efforts to crack down on opiate trafficking sources with increased regulations like a prescription database perhaps your local news station didnt strap a hidden camera onto someone and had them walk into several pain clinics within hours and had them hold up all the opiates they received within a few hours in front of the camera but dont get butt hurt just because your experiences are not mine ive lived in several places prior to moving to florida in the late and never ever saw a sign that said pain clinic on a retail store front in a shady stretch of road never saw billboards for them never heard radio ads for them never got mailers for them in our mailbox let alone seen someone holding signs for them on the side of the road also you might want to google the history of government regulations on prescription opiates and see when regulations were relaxed and why they proliferate in certain states in the first year that two florida laws aimed at curbing opioid prescriptions were in effect the states top opioid prescribers wrote significantly fewer prescriptions of this type of pain medication a new analysis led by researchers at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health finds perhaps watch this nbc clip and see what i mean west palm beach fla — florida has long been the nations center of the illegal sale of prescription drugs doctors here bought percent of all the oxycodone sold in the country last year at its peak so many outofstaters flocked to florida to buy drugs at more than pain clinics that the state earned the nickname oxy express also your defense of pain clinics is a bit hollow as though im not a medical professional and dont know about your pain needs but i have a co worker whos the daughter of a ex soldier that was stationed in germany and a german national she moved to the us for the first time a few years ago she was given hydrocodone for her occasional severe migraines here in the states she soon realized she didnt like america and wanted to move back but implied that she doesnt know how she will cope as they would never give her hydrocodone for her migraines she implied that she was told to cope with it in germany i get your personal situation affects your view on the position but dont be blinded by that and not recognize why of all commercially grown opiates on this planet are consumed by the us we prescribe opiates for reasons that most other nations do not we even use opiates that other developed nations do not were not in anymore pain than the rest of the world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i literally lold at this guy using his broward county experience to chastise all of florida and its residents south florida is like a completely different place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope palm beach hillsborough and orange and notice i said some having worked in the midwest if it wasnt for the weather and family being in florida i wouldve stay there broward county wasnt the worst per say palm beach county was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unless youre hunting anything nonwater related does suck here no good hiking whatsoever but i love the beach i love being near the water and fishing and getting a tan and the lack of serious cold so that more than makes up for the crap hiking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at least in the intercoastal they seem to have figured out that swimming to the side helps to not get hit by boats yea theyre just the definition of chill though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kids fall under them and die every once in a while
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my mom lives on the water in weeki wachee fl and they are in her backyard everyday that being said i understand why they are endangered theyre slow and sorry but kinda dumb like pandas no match against humans and their boats almost every manatee ive seen has a boat propeller scar on it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always loved going to see them at blue spring when my grandmother was still alive and living in port orange we were almost always there during breeding season so it was closed to divers but you could get close enough to the water to see dozens of them down there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,broward county
UpliftingNews,not_removed,canadians
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im from st pete lets remember though that the wrong administration in this state kind of steamrolls anything the locals try to stop at least pinellas has blued itself over the past few decades
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fair enough but it doesnt appear as though any significant savings are happening due to this change if someone was trying to disrupt the environment there and this was a way for them to do so id be less willing to trust the decision
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre still listed as protected and there are other endangered species in the area that would make it hard to develop even if they were taken off the list completely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to some extent this is true but it can bend your drive shaft when your prop hits think about hitting a stump with a lawn mower same concept
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you read what i wrote nice job changing my words
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like a boater to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats good news may i ask out of sheer curiosity where in florida you will be visiting if you have any questions or want any suggestions for things to do ask away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what states dont have pain clinics edit i replied before your wall of text rant was edited in i dont know why you think this is based in me needing opiates i dont have a regular opiate prescription i went there for the aforementioned steroid injections i was trying to point out that pain clinic is not a synonym for pill mill
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your anecdote about a friends daughter being used to justify your views on this matter followed by chastising the previous poster for their personal view is obnoxious and hypocritical if you believe a wall of text berating someone else peppered with weak sources including another reddit comment makes your stance stronger you are mistaken
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hell yeah they are i was fishing and one popped his head out next to the boat i didnt get my camera out before it went back under and it was like sorry bro ill come back in a sec and it did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i get some in the canal in my backyard just about every morning they seem to interact with my dog sometimes had about in the canal just the other morning very awesome animals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats good to hear i noticed a lot more speed limit signs and manatee warning signs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats where i was swimming with them theyre dumb but people speed and dont look out for the humps in the water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i lived in daytona beach for a few years but i never saw thats awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i work at the fwc next to usf stpete trust me the signs arent going anywhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,conservatives generally dont save us money anyway in the same breath they tell us that the debt is too high so we have to cut welfare and the military is decimated and needs bigger funding than the already mind blowing amount of money we give them if saving money is your metric this will never make sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a floridian who goes boating a lot i can tell you tgere are plenty of manatees and they are annoying asf this dude is a grade a asshole about manatees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we will be in the marconaples area just pray i dont get stung by a stingray this year lol thats all i ask 😂
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was funny
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what the fuck i didnt know they can talk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which you wont if theyre taken off this list and the fundingregulation behind that protection is dissolved
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not like the boaters obey that shit half the time anyways im from charlotte harbor in fl and go kayaking frequently and see anything with a motor on it blast by those signs although its usually younger adults and teens i see in their yachts doing the same thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right also you can tell theres a manatee because the water will swirl above the sea cow i guess youd have to be looking for it but if you are driving the boat then looking shouldnt be so hard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,blue spring state park is only half an hour or so from daytonaport orange its a great little place outside of manatee breeding season you can swim and scuba dive in the springs there never done it myself but it looks really cool theyre usually there yearround but the hot springs make for a good breeding spot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im dont subscribe to conservative ideologies but our military actually does a lot for global security spending cutsboosts there are trickier than most people would have you think lots of us companies have consumer basesbuy raw materials from the places around where our military patrols nukes are an awful deterrent system although spending money on them now is more about making sure they dont malfunction in storage but being able to strike anywhere when some dictator tries to destabilize a region is a fantastic deterrent good example is somalia our navy along with the dutch i think helped make the shipping lanes safe if that werent the case wed be paying a lot more for certain goods and wed have a tougher time with logistics in general i dont agree with them on welfare but i do think that social security is an outdated bloated monster
UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida bruh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh naples is nice i got stuck there for half a day on my way back to tampa from miami a couple of years ago when my car broke down driving through the everglades i spent most of my time waiting for my car to get fixed at the beach down there it was very nice oh no ive been hit by a stingray myself and they hurt just remember if youre walking in the water to shuffle your feet along the bottom instead of picking up your feet and stepping like you would on dry land this way you will scare the stingray out of the sand and away from your legs instead of stepping on him and making him sting you i hope you have a fun trip take lots of pictures
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can find it on rthathappened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha i wish i was too happy it came back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh boo hoo its quite likely the manatee became curious about what it saw just before it went under causing it to come back up for a closer look
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thread so far is very pessimistic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,til when people comment negative things in a thread in causes all the other comments to focus on trying to correct the threads posture here are some areas if you want to donate httpwwwofrandomactsorg or even to the red cross with the direction that the money be focused towards the families of the victims
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god damn all these people on here talking a bunch of crap on this guy raising tens of thousands of dollars for a charitable cause im positive theyve contributed nothing to why do they have to spread this bs negativity here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lots of money donated to people who could really use it redditors find ways to complain about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive just realized that there are a lot of people who dearly need rupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is a lot no matter who it comes from the good thing is he donated thats more toward helping its better than no money imo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cavs fan so i automatically hate steph curry this is an awesome move and i hate him a lot less because of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont like the dude but i respect this and the fact he actually sold those ugly kicks thumbs up steph
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awesome that they raised money for a good cause but wtf two fucking pairs of shoes the fuck is with people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nba mlb nfl etc make ridiculous money charge ridiculous amounts fine players and coaches stupid amounts how much have they donated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some poor lonely guy is going to be cumming into those shoes while a family starts to rebuild their life i think this is very sweet how such a simple gesture can help so many
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he probably literally could have bought like random shoes put them on for split second and auctioned them all off for like each raising like for charity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,steph curry my ass
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is why i think reddit has a higher proportion of assholes than the general population
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is what you usually get from rupliftingnews you get used to reddit behaviour
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people are mad they arent steph curry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes the god as cavs fans we should thank his trash performance for helping us get that ring 🙂 long live the king
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats he ever done to you im not a warriors fan but do live in the bay area and by all accounts dude is a class act get off your high horse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well the guy is a generational talent people like basketball and im sure that among the people who like basketball theres a good amount of people with money like that the shoes are probably worth it to them for the sake of owning part of history relating to something theyre very passionate about if i was a millionaire and has an interest in say nintendo id probably shell out a couple grand on a first run nes or some shit same thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,although i agree with your sentiment insofar as donations i vehemently disagree with the overpaid part are you this mad at the owner of the business you work for assuming you are not a contractor you should be athlete and most coach careers are super short and you should look at the lifetime salaries and compare them to the averages in other industries that generate the much money you will make over a mil in your lifetime its just that an athletes lifetime is roughly years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or he could have done nothing raising like for charity good job raising steph curry that amount of money will make a difference in some way to the families
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or he could have bought shoes thats only like shoes a day and made
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how does this have anything to do with this post
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hole you moron
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his current contract isnt as huge as some think i think or of his teammates make more than him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he still just donated dollars to something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cool how much have you submitted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i mean then families will know that theres a hope or rather he made a difference for those families if that makes the situation better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you help lol at least hes helping youre just on your keyboard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the average population is just as full of assholes they just arent as cynical that doesnt meant they dont do shitty things or good things from time to time like this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they hate us because they anus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nothing i dont like him as a player but i respect him and respect his contribution to the survivors how am i on my high horse for not liking someones on court persona maybe you should get off your own high horse expecting others to like the people you do i respect what he did i respect his skills set is the best we have ever seen and i respect he is the best shooter we have ever seen in the league but i wont cheer for the guy i will wtf when he lands something or crosses someone over
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also because the money is going to charity some people will feel a bit better paying more even though theyre already probably stupid rich
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why would i be mad with my employer thats just a dumb assumption if a athletes lifetime is years you just proved my point the association the league have been around for a lifetime and the dont pay theyre fair share let alone do anything for the community but ask for tax dollars for new stadiums and operate as tax free companies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is nice that he helped but to a professional basketball player just touching a piece of paper could be bought by someone for a lot so its easy to get the money to help more imagine if he could have given like to each family and you know he is taking a cut of the
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think enough people would buy them for that price still and the price would drop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think hes trying to make a point that pewdiepie wont get coverage like this but he did when it happened and he made the point terribly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont agree with the other guy at all but is still absolute peanuts to curry regardless hes currently making million per year and will likely make million per year starting next season so lets not act like would be a large amount of money to someone like curry edit is of just his yearly salary yearly salary not even his net worth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he didnt spend a dime afaik but i get your point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did i ever say i liked him theres just no reason to say you dont like someone youve never even met regardless of what they do for a living edit then again if you can judge someone by their public actions and attitudes sure you can draw that conclusion but im not sure hes someone who has done anything publicly to draw that sort of fire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,considering its charity and is peanuts to him i doubt he takes a cut nobody could know that is big money and at least hes doing something rather than sit back and do nothing i dont understand why you are hating on curry for not raising more when every other player isnt helping at all im not saying every other player is wrong for not helping i just think we should be praising curry for doing something at all and we should encourage other players to give back to the community rather than hate on the ones that do for not giving enough a simpler solution to your argument is to get another players to do what curry is doing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,leave the thread
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can understand the point youre making and agree i saw a lot of coverage of pewdiepies crazy generous stuff i thought it was well reported but maybe thats a reflection on the news sites i frequent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was the same with lebron then i saw how much he grew up to be a great person perhaps the same will happen with curry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not hating on curry i hugely respect what he is doing and it is great that he is helping out oakland honestly considering he donated at all it not only is helping the victims directly but encouraging others to donate as well also i was probably wrong about him taking a cut because the is very specific and if he did take a cut it probably would have been more like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gamogi is now gone died of the dumbs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre right i forgot to move the decimal point over still peanuts though and i think my case still stands
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well you definitely made it sound like you were criticizing him on donating charity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah sorry on being the water between the cracks im a huge pessimist so i always come off sounding really upset i was really just trying to say that there is always more and i didnt think of all the good it was already doing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a fucking month jesus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but how what was he eating and drinking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this made me well up i have two dogs i cannot imagine the relief and overwhelming joy i love dogs what a story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i too have a dachshund i am certain he would survive a blaze at our home he would just piss on everything until it no longer burned
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hooh must have had a hand in this on a serious note i couldnt imagine how happy they both were to see each other again must have been so scary for the poor guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my cat died years ago and ive never gotten over it i left for work kissed him goodbye and on my lunch break got a call from my boyfriend that pierre was dead on our bed he wasnt even i didnt see it coming and i couldnt bare to see his body since i have no closure every night i dream about finding him after years and years of him being missing that he was under the house or in the woods and every time i imagine holding him and crying and crying with joy that hes here after i thought id lost him i can only imagine thats what this woman felt how very lucky
UpliftingNews,not_removed,warrior heart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,please let him survive 😭
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah think i would have looked in the house for my dog despite what anyone said glad hes not dead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dogs name doggo targaryen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt ask for these feels
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im so glad he survived but am i the only one to find this horribly depressing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dog is like damn my owners have really let the place go to shit roof roof
UpliftingNews,not_removed,found one month later in the burntout house with a can full of gas and a hand full of matches and still wasnt found out chicka chicka chicka slimdoggy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my aunts house burned about seven years ago she lost almost all her animals but while they were excavating about two weeks later they found her sulcata tortoise in the rubble unhurt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why not confirm his death by locating the body im glad the little guy made it though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one question why the fuck it took month to find him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone call vet ranch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that sweet doggie wanted to live
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank god she decided to check things out before the house was completely demolished couldnt image that poor dog having to live through the fire and then most likely not surviving the demolition yikes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im thinking that this story isnt true considering the lack of a byline the shady way the website operates and the lack of other corroborating sources andor stories
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the dog that guy on lsd was looking for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they cant go that amount of time without food or water he definitely ate and drank something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we dont deserve the love dogs have for us he waited for a month just for her to come back for him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a month without water or food something about this story smells very bad if it doesnt even awnser the most basic questions to me its fake
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im shocked he lived that long he must of found food and drank water from the toilet or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was eminem honest imma kill you and them loudass motherfucking barking dogs and when the cops came through me and dre stood next to a burnt down house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont understand why she wouldnt have gone back to the house to search for the dog the article says she looked around the neighborhood but didnt go back to the house because she was told there was nothing salvageable if it was me i would have rechecked the house probably several times thank goodness the neighbors called and the dog was rescued
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fight on pupper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant cook this wiener long live the dachshund
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how do you not tear the burnt remnants apart looking for your dog way to not come to the rescue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry folks the boston leader is a fake news site this never happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry to kill the vibe but bostonleadercom is crackpot news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cannot believe that the owner didnt go back to the house at least one time after the fire to at least look for her dog just once
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wicked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for the early morning tears
UpliftingNews,not_removed,saw picture and thought thats not a boston
UpliftingNews,not_removed,little dude bark next time and i hope never a next time go forth and thrive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this dog is an arsonist they always return to the scene of the crime
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how did they miss him during overhaul
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wished they showed what the house looked like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did anyone else imagine her screaming roger repeatedly in that coochicoo voice and cringe internally
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn this dude walks to school uphill both ways
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a month with no water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida dog ftfy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait the searchers couldnt find a live dog in a burned house for a month
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that poor little beast
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant really understand why she hadnt checked the house despite of what those firemen said though if i knew my pets were inside a building that caught fire i wouldnt rest before i got them out either dead or alive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and reddit gets trolled again by a fake news site
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dachshunds never die
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats so cute 😍
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my old housemates cat disappeared for five weeks once she was distraught then one day he just showed up he was scrawny as hell and had no fur on the last inches of his tail which looked really creepy he was quite a fluffy black cat and he just had this pink tail spike sticking out of the fluff very weird anyway the house next door had been undergoing a major renovation at the time and the building site had been quiet for weeks the day he showed up happened to be the day the works started up again so we figured hed gotten trapped in there somehow and had been living on water leaks and cockroaches
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dumb bitch should go to jail the human i mean animal cruelty makes me sick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anyone else remember pet sematary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did they find dre in that burned out house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sweet little thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i were the owner id be hysterical with guilt and tears that dog can have as many treats as he wants for the rest of his life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,glad to hear u got our lil buddy back what a happy ending to a terrible story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive never seen a case like this in all my years he really must have someone up there looking after him well that someone sure did a fucking number on their house lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not crying youre crying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it would have been super awkward if they had already gotten a new dog
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mini dachshunds are awesome weve had a couple over the years and our last one is still alive and kicking at twenty one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,looks like a dachshund german engineering wins again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this sub can be so unuplifting a dog starved in a burnt out house for a month finally got rescued horrible things happening to people and then the victims getting saved isnt uplifting im sad because the dog starved for a month
UpliftingNews,not_removed,miracles do happen your fucking house went up in a blaze and luckily a neighbor heard what he thought were vagrants before you put a wrecking ball through your emaciated dog that was trapped in a hellscape for weeks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is nice an all but bostonleadercom is a fake clickbait site many of their articles are on httpwwwsnopescomtagbostonleader also a dog can only survive days without water not a month
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she didnt bother to look where the poor dog was left
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how do you not search the place for your dog afterwards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wanted hotdogs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sitting at the bar at chilis and stated to cry my usual bartender asked if i was ok showed her this she started to cry shared with other servers now of us are crying amazing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shes but talks like shes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bullshit that dog was fucking abandoned by the owner
UpliftingNews,not_removed,despite the headline suggesting a month apparently the house fire was early october and he was found on the so more like weeks than a month still its a pretty impressive length of time to trapped in there and it still be a tale of survival
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whoa whoa whoa miss lippy the part of the story i dont like is that the little boy gave up looking for happy after an hour he didnt put posters up or anything he just sat on the porch like a goon and waited that little boys gotta think you got a pet you got a responsibility if your dog gets lost you dont look for an hour then call it quits you get your ass out there and you find that fucking dog
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jesus only survived days this dog did one full month
UpliftingNews,not_removed,must have been trapped in the pantry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah this isnt uplifting at all that dog was stuck for weeks starving alone and terribly injured in the burned out husk of its home
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they just assumed he was dead or whatever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obviously they werent that scared
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if hes anything like my dogs his own shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if dogs are anything like people a month without food is doable while even a few days without water is deadly he must have had access to pooleddripping rainwater or water used to put out the fire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,toilet water and prolly trash
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well they call him shotzy for a reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the other pets that survived the fire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i welled up because roger looks a lot like my little shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not me no way uhuh no tears from this gruff dude i just picked a really bad time to buy fresh cut onion scent air freshener
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think it might be a wiener thing ive had two dachshunds and know a couple others whove said theyre very stubborn when it comes to potty training
UpliftingNews,not_removed,low profile helps protect from smoke inhalation as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mine would just burrow to safety guaranteed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mine would just out stubborn the fire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a longtime pokemon fan im ashamed to say i dont understand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was months ago that mine died out of the blue he as fighting fit at years old at least that was what the vet had told me two months prior sadly my wife and i had taken our first holiday together in years we flew home immediately i will never ever forget that feeling of sheer and utter desperation for something to be not true i had got him to help me with losing my fiance at the time i see him in my dreams and they are inevitably about me losing him again and again i understand exactly what you are going through to the letter and wish i didnt im so sorry i wish i could tell you how sorry i was and have it mean something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,our little gambit was a tiny white fluffy persian who literally did not give a shit about vacuums or baths or anything after when he was a kitten an akita picked him up in his mouth and he shat himself out of fear later he had ringworm and an infection in his paw dude saw some shit was barely years old when i just got off work and he starts panting really strangely he starts trying to find places of comfort in the house while losing his balance and twitching and panting he starts seizing and dies within minutes of it all starting we think it was sudden congestive heart failure very traumatic and we were devastated for weeks he was the coolest cat happened eve of thanksgiving as a psa teacup dwarf breed cats are known to have these genetic diseases and are far less stable gambit was given to us and we werent aware dont encourage this shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we had cats all the time growing up some ran away the few that died when i was quite little did that typical cat thing and went away to die just got old and tried to leave so little me never saw them pass but we also had a tubby black and white cat named carly who was blind and obviously couldnt go places as easily one day she just stopped drinking or eating and i spent all day holding a spoon with water in front of her face trying to encourage her to drink our other cat stacey who had always ignored her in all their years together parked herself next to carly for the afternoon carly kept moving to random places in the house that werent normal for her to be in like between the sofa and the tv table stacey kept following eventually i had in her my lap and she had what i think was some kind of seizure vomiting and urinating on me simultaneously i a naive fourteenyearold was horrified she seemed dead then for some reason we still went to the vet she woke up in the car and i got so hopeful thinking shed be fine with some veterinary care instead the vet called us in the middle of the night and said that she had a fatal disease that congealed fluid around her lungs and made it hard to breathe they put her to sleep and part of me wishes i had asked my mom if we could go back and be with her oof i havent thought about carly in a while i still remember the tickytacky sound of her fingernails as she slowly came into the bedroom before pausing at the end of the bed and meowing softly to be picked up we still have stacey i gotta go snuggle her now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you may have already but you need a ritual to mark the passing of your beloved friend funerals are important for the living for the very reasons you describe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was so desperate and crazy i pondered digging mine up so i could see him again yeah i was that bad leroy was a once in a lifetime feline years is too long my love do you have any other pets if not you need one imo i hope they find you or vice versa you need another love that stupid saying is trite but true it is better to know and lose love than to never love at all joy painjoy rinse repeat wishing you peace xo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel so sorry for you i lost a year old rabbit unexpectedly in much the same way except i put her in a shoebox and carried her far into the forest and buried her soft little body in deep snow it was my only real option the ground was frozen solid one morning i was cuddling her then a few hours later she was dead i still dont know why she was so cute she was a blue holland lop even though i buried her i unintentionally expected to see her whenever i entered my room for a long time and that was really hard also thinking about her body decomposing in the spring thaw andor getting eaten was not a pleasant thought but that is a natural thing for a dead rabbit to go through so i eventually got over it even though i just cried typing this out on my phone years later my cat buck was gone for days once and i could barely function crying all the time i was having dreams about him and chasing random cats and hearing phantom meows and shit i had put up posters around town and all that jazz but then i had basically given up thinking he was dead i dont know if i ever would have recovered i was at home for lunch when i heard him meow at the front door he was super skinny i think he was locked in someones garage or something but he was fine i immediately got him a homing beacon on his collar and we just recently finished training him on an invisible fence so he can only roam our yard i want to clone him and have him raise his clones so when he dies i dont feel the same massive hole i felt when i thought he was gone forever anyway i feel your pain i hope you can find closure some day did you get another cat later i dont think i will be able to live without some kind of furry companion from now on animals are just so wonderful mammals especially
UpliftingNews,not_removed,about years ago i lost my dog he had a huge seizure and died right infront of me im happy you didnt have to watch it at least that was one of the toughest days in my life just watching him die and not being able to do anything this time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my cat of years died recently her kidneys were failing and we had already revived her from the same issue a couple years ago this time around the vet said we could do the same treatment subcutaneous hydration but we dont know how much time it would buy her and the process sticking a needle in her scruff every day might make her last months contemptuous with us so we decided not to do it this time around towards her last days she kept wanting to go outside since she couldnt go far wed let her stay on our back deck for the day then bring her in at night one night i found her at the neighbors underneath their car the next night i couldnt find her its really hard not having closure and i really dont know if she died naturally or if a coyote got her that kind of haunts me that her last moments of life may have been filled with terror sad thing is i had called our vet a few days earlier she couldnt come because she was out of town with a family emergency she gave us the name of a business that comes to your house and puts the cat down i was hesitating to call because i wanted a thorough exam first i just wish i had done that now she would have died in my arms and we could have buried her in her favorite spot in the garden
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im so sorry pets are so close to our hearts and have such short lives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh god been there in when i went to college my dog roxy ended up dying because she left the yard looking for me it was a huge oversight by my parents because she was never chained or fenced as she was years old and had never left the yard a single time but her fearing i was missing was enough for the old girl to change her way of thinking to this day six years later i still dream about waking up with her at the end of my bed the guilt over being the reason why she died alone still gets to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for those wondering if ive gotten another cat i have a whole furry army at the moment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone needs to make rogers story of survival into a movie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,after two nights at the animal hospital roger was released into ms whitakers care and has already started to show signs of regaining the weight he lost during his ordeal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he avoided burns of smoke inhalation from the fire despite being stuck in there for weeks its a daschund little fuckers are near indestructible got of those one of them defended our home when big wild dogs came in and attacked he got beaten up really badly with huge tears and holes all around his back and neck but bought enough time for us to wake up and scare them away before rushing him to the vet that was one month ago and now hes all patched up and running around happy as ever damn i love that idiot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can say that about literally any post in this sub
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because its dangerous as hell in a burned up house the floor might not be able to hold your weight and you would fall to the next level the roof or ceiling over your head might fall on you if the electricity is not turned off might be exposed live wires or any other of the numerous things i cant think of owner probably broke a law breaking into her own house to get the dog firefighter in our neighborhood sustained an injury during a fire had a desk job for a while now is selfemployed all that said i am glad the owner was worried about the dog and not the house as i tell my kids i can replace the things but i cant replace you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i knew a volunteer firefighter who lived in a super rural community im talking less than people some older gentleman was wheelchair bound and trapped inside when his home caught fire he said all they found of him once they put it out was the remains of the wheelchair and some vertebrae id imagine a small weiner dog would be dust in a house fire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,prolly assumed he ran away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does the fire department let civilians mess around in burnt up building husks where you live
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and one that you can even subscribe to thanks for this i was going to post this earlier since way too many of my friends post their crap links all over facebook since im a news junkie and used to live in that neighborhood i looked all over to find something corroborating that fire and nope not a thing youd think the globe wouldve picked this one up if it were true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh these fake news sites are becoming a serious problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how on earth is this animal cruelty did you even read it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly and he survived a whole month by ordering pizza and chinese food
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how does a year old talk differently as opposed to an year old
UpliftingNews,not_removed,proof
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its crazy how they can go weeks without foodwater
UpliftingNews,not_removed,still its a pretty impressive length of time to trapped in there and it still be a tale of survival im pretty sure you meant tail of survival
UpliftingNews,not_removed,survivordoggo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tail of survival ftfy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the dog was just found amongst the rubble there was no indication that it was trapped the dog probably ran away when the fire happened and returned and was found
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i accidentally left my dog in the crawl space days later he finally started barking he came out of there pretty hungry weeks is crazy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tail
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy fuck the comments not realizing this is from a movie how young are you people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my thoughts exactly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think its time to play dodgeball
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at no point in your rambling incoherent response did you come close to anything resembling a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to you speak i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you funny dickhead have an upvote
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most awesome accident ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would love to be trapped in a pantry great excuse to eat alllllll the poptarts in one go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats disgusting my dog would never do that instead he eats my cats poop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,debatable the broad general rule we give for survival rates is the rule of days without water weeks without food before succumbing to malnourishment and i think its hours in the water before exhaustion or hypothermia kicking in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a month weeks hm listen weve been working on this rule for a while and this kind of info is going to throw all our hard work away i think its safer to say weeks is the maximum
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have two half brothers that look just like him too i was damn near crying too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha wiener
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when my mom got our mini daschund looks identical to one in the article the breeders had paper trained the puppies we still havent managed to house break him years later
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my year old doxie never got the hang of only going to the bathroom outside sure she would go outside if she happened to be outside when she had to go but if she was inside she didnt always feel like waiting or changing locations stubborn thing now shes in later stages of disc degeneration and can barely use her back legs and i long for the days when she would take a piss and run away sweet stubborn things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank god im not the only one when i got mine from the shelter they said he was potty trained and no matter what i do i cant get him to stop having accidents in the house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats actually a good point i wonder how he survived the blaze itself though like where he hid to not get burned
UpliftingNews,not_removed,should clear things up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think that when our pets die they go to a special place in heaven and when we die they will all be waiting for us youll see them at a distance in a nice green field with the sun shining and theyll be playing and look so happy then theyll see you and come sprinting towards you and can run off to play together forever and it will be perfect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im so sorry too really its so unbearable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pierre was a sphynx and yeah sudden congestive heart failure is what we think too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh carly god thats so horrible im so sorry you had to see that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have his ashes ive had them for years think i should release them and have a little ceremony
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is probably a good idea my childhood cat had to be put down on the and i decided on wearing black for at least a solid week its hard because i didnt live nearby enough to see her often or even be there when she passed but my mom was there with her until the end anyway i feel like my own little mourning ritual is helping only two more days of mourning clothes left
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you so much for sharing that i have cats and now absolute loves and joys of my life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have cats and dogs now and i love them that much more fiercely as im so scared of what i could lose
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im glad he didnt die alone and im so sorry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy shit i am done with the internet for the day life is horrible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,argh that must be so so painful not knowing either way shes out of pain now im so sorry you went through that i can only imagine it must be agony
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh what a sweet heart she must have been its not your fault but god damn these dreams get the better of us dont they
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hour montage of eating poop and drinking fire hose water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yay thank you d
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait i want to hear more of this story wild dogs infiltrated your house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,alot of dachshunds have no regard for side my dachshund got a full grown moose to run from him for about feet before the moose realised its size advantage and tried to get my dog with his horns i had to throw lawn furniture at that huge bastard while i got my dog inside
UpliftingNews,not_removed,near indestructible you say begins development of daschund based metal gear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,word i have a year old dachshund he was abandoned in a kennel in the middle of the night when he was about he was emaciated and scared when he was found hes been with us for years now in the early years i accidentally ran him over in my dodge dart weird story my brother was letting him out to potty dog saw me pulling in the driveway got excited and charged the car to greet me i couldnt see him because of the way the car sits my bro said the tire just missed him then he rolled out from under the car the engine crossmember had struck his back he had a long shallow cut on his back from it otherwise unharmed seriously a lucky son of a bitch his back legs quit working about summers ago we couldnt afford a surgical remedy so we used the forced craterest method after months he was basically good to go but a bit wobbly from time to time spring of this year he went suddenly and unexpectedly blind it was almost overnight as far as i could tell his favorite thing in the world is to chill in the sun on the back deck i never imagined that he would push his way through the balusters one day i was hanging with him on the deck me reading him laying in the sun i went inside for something he was unattended for less than a minute and i heard a yelp i knew exactly what had happened so i raced downstairs to find him looking confused on the ground feet below our deck he heard me talking and started wagging his tail pretending he was fine a few weeks prior to this hed been diagnosed with kidney disease so id spent a bit of time thinking about end game for him and how id like to have a vet come to the house rather than take him to the vet which terrifies him i would rather he take his final rest in my arms with the sun warming his face than in the sterile cold of a strangers office my best laid plans seemed a wash as i drove him to the vet thinking this is it this is the end hes all broken inside and this is the last time i will see him alive and he was fine nothing broken nothing bleeding just bruised and wobbly a year old blind dachshund fell feet from my balcony and he was fine he went home with me that day and i installed boards on my deck to prevent him from being able to fall off again its funny and more than a bit heartbreaking to watch him bump into stuff as he navigates the home hes lived in for years and within the last months hes gone deaf in his right ear so when you call him he spins in a circle to his left but he still wags his tail when you touch him he still loves to eat and hes still perfectly house trained so were enjoying what time weve got left with him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nearly indestructible our little fucker just died friday from a bad heart she would have taken on a goddam kodiak bear for us she was that fiercely loyal the only thing that could kill the little shit was her own oversized heart goddam i loved her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dachshund badger hound
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dogs are the best disclaimer two cats own me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my father had a mini dachshund that survived a coyote attack tough little dog
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same my lbs weenier named lemmiwinks sounds like a demon and chases roving pit bulls away from house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,vertebrae damn that would be horrific
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dog feared dead in home fire you dont even have to read the article to see youre wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was trapped out of sight or hearing in a structure that was condemned as a total loss and scheduled to be bulldozed i dont see why we need to criticize anyone for this shit happens its not always necessary to assign blame
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if it is my house there is no way they could legally stop me as soon as their job is done police on the other hand could but lets be honest would they post a cop out there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not that i would expect the dog to have survived but that i would need to see the body for closure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would look good person i would look as a control burner i have been around many many many fires ive helped the fire department burn down derelict buildings ive burned thousands and thousands of acres for wildlife management i would look person i would look but im also a dog trainer so i guess that means my dogs mean more to me edit made my pronouns gender neutral
UpliftingNews,not_removed,testify
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like im walking into a trap after the first couple of weeks i was resigned to the fact that he did in fact perish in the blaze and i started to lose all hope i was pretty inconsolable for a long time that sounds like an elderly lady choosing her words carefully and not your average year old i thought it was funny
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my dog acts like its the end of the world if im late on his second feeding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they cant that dog definitely found water somewhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the dog must have had some kind of water in there probably puddles left over from the firefighters or maybe rainwater was able to leak into the damaged structure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i read another news story about a little girl and a dog trapped in a closet when they were found the little girl had already died from dehydrationstarvation but the dog was still alive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its crazy how they can go weeks without foodwater they cant dont spread false ideas dogs need to drink just as often as humans the dog was probably drinking from puddles the the firehoses left behind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im no doctor but im fairly sure living things cant go more than a week at most without hydration
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a dog can survive two to three days without water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait whatdogs can go without food and water for weeks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,food yes water no three weeks wouldnt he die he probably just drank toilet water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you want me to bite you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats a survivordoggo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if it couldnt break out then its unlikely that it could break back in i didnt suggest that it had been trapped by rubble either i would suggest it was more likely it hid as dogs are prone to do when scared was subsequently shut in in any case it still wasnt a month
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how did you not notice you have no dog for days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gotta be more subtle my man dont italicize the joke we gotchu fam
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what movie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay a simple wrong wouldve done just fine but
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the civilized way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,according to my first dogs vet cat poop is proteinpacked so its like candy to them years after hearing that for the first time it still makes me cringe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my dog recycles her poop also along with my other dogs poop who needs puppy poopie bags when i can just use my puppy pooper scooper i wonder if i can rent her out as a waste recycling tool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my dog has a taste for duck poop it must be a delicacy or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually rabbit also eat their own poop apparently their poop has protein
UpliftingNews,not_removed,complete with the satisfying crunch of kitty litter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one kittehs poop is another doggos food
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the last three i remember is minutes without air
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as long as he can get some water the dog would be fine even then if the dog could find some juicy birds or rats to eat he may not even need the water a juicy camel would be the best of both worlds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i saw on a trivia show once that humans can survive without food and water longer then they can without sleep i was surprised and also skeptical
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dapple dachshunds unite in all serious though i did a google search and it seems as if this is a girl dachshund named lola and this story happened in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when we got our puppy we had an older dachshund about eight years we got some puppy pads for him to use he proceeded to continuously shred them and just follow his big brother outside to pee dachshunds only get potty trained if they decide so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,true fact did you know that doxy used to mean a prostitute or a woman of loose morals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know what i saw that a few weeks ago i just forgot about it i love origins i wish the episodes were longer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a nice idea i would do about anything for it to be true maybe i can believe in this too it goes against everything else i believe in but i miss him so muchi genuinely dont know how to finishing writing post i think im going to go and make a cup of tea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is what i must and do believe to survive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id love to just lie down and have every animal i loved and lost attack me with love thatd be heaven for me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this video makes me cry every single time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think there is no heaven or hell for them they just turn into dust
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes do it youre obviously still hurting from this and you need some release a time to grieve to acknowledge your kittums and what he brought into your life and to close that chapter of your life on your own terms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sorry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is a real connection i swear it twice when leroy came up missing i sat prayed and found him i realize prayer seems out of fashion and i am not a terribly religious person the first time he was hurt and recovered the second time my heart knew he was gone somehow id been looking in the woods for him so i could bury him looking for a week the day i found him i had been cryingthen this bizarre calm and determination came over me i put on my shoes and walked into the woods directly to his body i believe in a power that connects all living things especially if you feel strongly for them it seems to me that he would forgive you for being afraid to see him to say your goodbyes i am glad you have fur kidsi will worry less forgive yourself and find peace
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was a yr old boxer so i guess it was about his time im just happy knowing i gave him an extra months
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey on the bright sidebefore he actually died something similar happened and i gave him cpr for about a minute which brought him back and he lived another month as the happiest dog ive ever seen he wouldnt leave my side when i was home
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah its not its lovely amazing scary terrible sad hilarious agonizing wonderful and the whole enchilada never all one or the other try and remember that trust me am old bagseen some good seen some bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cmon lets hollywood gussy it up big explosions epic fires heartbreaking close calls with heartwarming dreams at night the big finish sells itself as well as the hilarious after credits where roger gets spoiled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought he was going to put him down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry if my vocabulary isnt accurate not my native language this happened on my parents secondary property which is in the forest relatively far from other houses neighbours are chill there usually arent any dangerous animals those wild dogs being a very rare case only the second time i see some in years so sometimes we leave the door open that day we just painted walls inside and figured theyd dry faster so yeah no barriers or anything around they just came all the way there probably looking for food and attacked my dog when he started barking after they ran away he somehow dragged himself under my bed bleeding everywhere when i saw how he looked i thought he was already dead but nope the vet did an amazing job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah uh what the fuck do you live in the australian outback
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah op wtf dont leave us hanging
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the only thing that could kill the little shit was her own oversized heart damn thats rough sorry the older one i have is and recently got diagnosed with the same thing shes had a heart murmur since she was a puppy and its starting to take a toll on her still able to go for a walk but no running anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ha i always get it wrong thanks in french its teckel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nevertheless i hadnt given up hope that roger might be found alive as i clung to the chance hed been able to escape the blaze and was roaming the neighborhood this was in the article though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,funnily enough you do have to read the article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what i find amazing is that the dog was still able to scratch and make some noise after being stuck for several weeks its a bit surprising no one noticed earlier
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did no one enter the house after the fire no firefighters or insurance company or owner they just thought the dog is definitely dead no reason to look for it or save it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah nbd if you get yourself trapped and first responders have to risk their lives to save you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a practicing attorney and former firefighter so i guess i have a unique view on this with that said id be all over my property doing everything i could to find my dog and wouldnt stop until i knew what happened one way or the other the people here down voting you who submit to some alleged authority are the types like the owners in this article it seems
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually yes there is a legal way police and firefighters are all law enforcement and there are laws against entering condemned properties not just for your safety but for the safety of those who would have to come save your stupid ass when you got hurt by debris firefighters are as legally bound to enforce those laws as the cops are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i get that actually
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im and i usually talk like this is this so weird
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my dog literally pukes out of frustration if were more than about minutes late
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my dog poops stones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah and my dog is plotting to shit in my shoe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,show him this maybe hell be more grateful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,water is a byproduct of fire im not kidding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,drank her blood
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rule of thumb on fuckin up you can go minutes without air you can go days without water you can go weeks without food
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dr gingerpepsi reptiles insects cactus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dogs dont sweat so they can probably last a little longer than us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,apparently not based on the comments i got they can survive max days without water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that got sexual fast
UpliftingNews,not_removed,go ahead your bark is worse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a big ol survivorpupper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no u
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i noticed he was gone but didnt know where he had gone we lived in the country and it was pretty common for them to take off for a few days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont see a joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,billy madison
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do people let their dogs eat their poo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its actually not protein but fat cats cant digest all of the fat in their diet so they need lots of it in their food cat food is very high in fat and so is their poop fat is the thing on a dogs taste list
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we always used to yell at the dog to stop digging in the litter box for tootsie rolls so your vet may have been on to something there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no wonder my little dachshund would eat cat poop with as much gusto as a fresh filet mingon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kitty roca if its from the litter box
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how bad is it really to let them do that i mean it feels gross but is it super unhealthy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,upvote for puppy pooper scooper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pupper scooper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pate foie gross
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you also own ducks orrr
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a little more complicated than that the stool that rabbits eat are called cecotropes theyre different than the normal pelletlike stool in that cecotropes are soft and shiny looking they eat them because they contain nutrients that the body couldnt absorb the first time around when eating their normal diet rabbits dont eat the pelletlike stool though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes they eat then poop then eat their poop once then poop it out then most of the time stand on it till its flat then lay another poop onto that layer of poop then eats again then poops ontop of the layer of poop then that continues till the poop eating rabbit dies interesting shit litterally
UpliftingNews,not_removed,generations before old age
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that would be one selfless camel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its true actually look on youtube the page is called he does a video on sleep deprivation the longest anyone has ever gone without sleep is days but after just hours your brain starts to actually put itself to sleep wether youre awake or not it might just be for a few seconds here and there but it does do it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kinda a weird argument though because from what i read no one has ever died from sleep deprivation httpswwwscientificamericancomarticlehowlongcanhumansstay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,me too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay now im crying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,without failure this always makes me cry but theyre tears of joy so thanks for sharing i had not seen this in a while
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think we would all do anything for it to be true i think you are doing a good job trying and as the saying goes prepare for the worst and hope for the best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think that youre entitled to your opinion of course but theres a time and a place for everything and you could do with a few lessons on how not to be a giant asshole when people are grieving if a thought helps someon make it through their sadness let it be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i prefer to think the other way only because theres nothing to lose by it and everything to gain if we each have our own little heaven and it is what we imagine it to whatever we want its nicer to imagine something good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre right its time to let my boy go i think ill wait until im at my mums house she lives in vast australian bushland and he loved chasing the kangaroos and chickens around itll be hard and sad but youre right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh thats so beautiful and sad leroy was calling for you to come and see him out of the world and thanks i dont think ill ever forgive myself for how alone and scared he must have been but i hope i find peace knowing that hes not hurting anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awww i had boxers when i was young best dogs ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i respect your position on this but i will never forgive life for being so broadly shitty in so many cruel ways cancer and animal abuse and indiscriminate disease and natural disastersfuck this shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its amazing what you can learn from reading the article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who the neighbor theres no other obvious he in the article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is terrifying poor pupper imagining him dragging himself under your bed is too much whatever that dogs favorite thing is he deserves it every day i cant hold all these dachshund feels today
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for not being your native language i actually feel you were more accurate than most native english speakers glad your little weenie dog is okay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow thats crazy thanks for telling the story im glad your pup was ok after you got him help
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where do you live where wild dogs get into houses
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpwwwvirtualoceanianetnewcaledoniamapsearthjpg
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpimgurcomafgpin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hanging i told you he survived and hes fine now might upload a pic tomorrow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpiimgurcomxraksbijpg
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hoped assumed though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shoot i am how can you not look for the dog if not to recover the body immediately after i couldnt leave my dog like that id have to know
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are laws against entering a condemned house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or i could come back the next day like most people and sift through what was left article said a month not while or hours later also ive had a house catch fire and i did go in after my old deaf and blind dog twice i drug him out with me only for him to slip his collar and run his silly ass back inside no first responders necessary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trapped in a previously burned house have you ever been to a burned house or put out a house fire i know the answer but im illustrating a point in my years of firefighting i never once had a call of someone trapped in a previously burned house ive never heard of this happening and we never once trained for the scenario despite training for just about everything in other words its incredibly rare if this happens to youlook for your dog
UpliftingNews,not_removed,let them downvote me bro it does not hurt my feelings i would do anything to get my pooch back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not where i am from firefighters are first responders but not law enforcement thats where they give the cops orders when the fire is done they generally all leave
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no its not its completely ordinary to have limited vocabulary in this day and age well at least its being normalized for the worse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you wont feed me so heres some food i meansure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a cat that also employs this form of protest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you sure that isnt bile some dogs like mine used to will basically froth up their digestion engines in anticipation of food at a regular interval its like minor heart burn but dogs dont care about throwing up so they dont hold back at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your dog can tell time stop frontin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this can be solved pretty easily dont feed your dog stones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my dog did that in a cab one time we named him rocks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most of it usually departs with the smoke though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was a dog not a cat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can go months without food fixed for american readers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,let me clarify mammals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh okay that makes sense thank you for not being a dick about it also
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but they still cool themselves through their respiratory system which is from the evaporational cooling of water no weeks is still surprising
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so what the hell could have kept this dog alive i cant accept miracle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what you do is a hard time getting you to know the most of the things i am really doing and before i get to you i dont want to be the person you want to hear about you and i am really sad and sad 😭
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats a swadooblegooper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nuggietend pupper rubies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but without his bags
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because some dogs would have to be chained and muzzled not to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its also one of the reasons why a cat on hunger strike longer than a day is a problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the correct answer bf is a vet cat is fat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,almond roca
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think snow caps is the most appropriate term here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,naahh my house backs down onto a park with a creek and a bike track and we have no fence so all sorts of animals come into our yard scrub turkeys dump birds ibis ducks owls possums big frillies couple of blue tongues a few red belly blacks we get all sorts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,silflay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stings from a hornet to kill a man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youll be dead way before minutes if your air supply is cut off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a couple months ago a boy in my city was at a school event that involved the schools pool he ended up being under water for about seconds before another kid pulled him out these are middle schoolers not one adult or lifeguard quotes because i dont think they were accredited lifeguards performed cpr for fear of a possible spinal injury kid went about mins before paramedics arrived and started cpr the boy ended up being totally brain dead and on life support for close to a month before parents pulled the plug my whole point is if someone would have done cpr on him right away very good chance he would still be alive doctors said it and first responders said it your brain cant go mins without oxygen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,after minutes your brain starts to essentially die to the point it cant restore itself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah and a rich one as those plane tickets from the middle east to the us are pretty expensive but i guess it would only be a one way flight too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but one cant survive eleven days without water so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to that episode for the lazy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which is why you shouldnt drive tired a few seconds can be deadly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikifatalfamilialinsomnia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how was that being an asshole me saying that some would go to hell would be me being an asshole even then it is a discussion of what we think happens when our pets die ive lost many cats but i think they turn into dust after they die you dont have to sugarcoat it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh most definitely a great happy ending
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a real philosopher over here guys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre dumb but theyre awesome second favorite dog next to a rottweiler
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey thanks a lot one of the reasons i started using reddit was to practice my english glad to know its paying off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,glad your little weenie dog is okay im glad you added dog to that sentence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,see answers below
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i demand pics of said pupper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you guys have internet out there give the lil guy a treat from me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i once met two really cool guys from new caledonia on a bus in queensland the bus broke down and these guys started to play guitar and we jammed to system of a down later on we shared a couple of joints on a beach ive wanted to visit ever since
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats your internet speed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,welp apparently there is some law against this we better not look for our dog fuck it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in your years of firefighting you was a lawyer days ago dont spread around wrong information nobhead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes it is bile
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dogs can have routines and yes theyll know if youre late on feeding if you do it at the same time every day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,could you tell that to my dog please
UpliftingNews,not_removed,diaper dog diaper dog
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow i guess that doesnt rock
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get the water nigguh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,let me clarify camels
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if hes not panting from heat or exertion he wont lose too fast that way typical house has toilet bowls full of standing water that should give him a good head start if hes smart enough to pull the handle he can double that and get whats in the tanks too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so the dog apparently drank the water from the puddles that were there and i guess he was starving for almost a month which is insane if you ask me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lmao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt know it was possible to roll my eyes and cringe at the same time sothank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,granola bars
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow sounds adventurous so youve been successfully able to distinguish the duck poop from the rest of the bird poop and conclude that your dogs prefer it over others serious question
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pumps to make babby
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not one adult or lifeguard quotes because i dont think they were accredited lifeguards performed cpr for fear of a possible spinal injury kid went about mins before paramedics arrived and started cpr this is mainly a education issue everyone is scared of touching people because of spinal injuries but havent actually been formally educated on spinal injuries airway and circulation always trumps spinal if you have have someone stabilise great but without the first two the doesnt matter for shit because theyre dead anyway your brain cant go mins without oxygen its closer to seconds source emerg nurse cpr is my gym day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats so sad i dont understand how that happened though someone must have called for the paramedics in the first place in the meantime why werent they going down a checklist where someone would be told to check for a pulse or breathing and it would be clear that cpr should be the priority until the paramedics arrive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seven minutes in heaven
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is no point where the brain or its individual cells can restore itself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its cool how you think these things through
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it can be my professors put videos up all the time that and its not like most redditors are going to read a scientific article on sleep deprivation not do they need to if theres a video explaining it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that would be a horrible way to die
UpliftingNews,not_removed,prions are terrifying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just the golden rule dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all again youre entitled to think what you want but in tips particular thread these folks are attempting to comfort each other with the knowledge that theyll see their pets again again youre entitled to your opinion but i maintain that your comment was crass given the content of the previous ones perhaps asshole wasnt a great choice of word ill apologize for that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your english is way better than my french i sound like i have had some kind of brain trauma when i speak french
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you have better grammar and a broader vocabulary than some people that speak native english
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i bet youve learned all sorts of swear words and slang this way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tomorrow then its am p edit actually heres an for now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha i get that a lot dont worry hes spoiled and he knows how to fake a limp when he wants something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah that sounds like something wed do haha feel free to pm me whenever you decide to visit if you need some pointers or just hang out d
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mines about though thats on wifi not sure if it changes anything not glorious but i dont download much and its good enough for browsing or gaming
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people change careers all the time some fire departments use volunteers that have other jobs try not to insult people over invalid assumptions next time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay smartass since you insist on being that guy go all the way can you please label every possible living thing andor special circumstances where a being could go without hydration for more than days and not suffer dehydration
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah the ducks are always near our pool and thats where i always catch my puppy eating poop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and a partridge in a pear tree
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah no its much shorter than that closer to than
UpliftingNews,not_removed,any adult andor lifeguard should have known that air trumps spinal injury the spine can be fixed or at least somewhat mended later on that air loss cant be replaced i have no formal medical or cpr training and even i know this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the school majorly fucked up i can proudly say theyre getting the pants sued off of them for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know what he meant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sometimes you just gotta think it through
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i also thought it was pretty assy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh dear unotamuggle you must be new we missed your whole intro to the internet orientation so sorry for the mix up please come this way were gonna start you out on the disney comment boards and work our way up from there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just the golden rule dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all with that logic you would never be able to criticize anyone for anything and what i said wasnt even bad it was what i thought would happen just like what op thought happens when they die what the guy described is called the rainbow bridge according to the story when a pet dies it goes to the meadow restored to perfect health and free of any injuries the pet runs and plays all day with the others there is always fresh food and water and the sun is always shining however it is said that while the pet is at peace and happy they also miss their owner whom they left behind on earth when their owner dies they too arrive at the meadow and that is when the pet stops playing turns sniffs at the air and looks into the distance where they see their beloved owner excited they run as fast as they can until they are one jump away from their owners arms the pet licks its owners in joy while the human looks into the soft eyes of their pet who might have been absent on earth but never absent in their heart then side by side they cross the rainbow bridge together into heaven never again to be separated if people get butt hurt and are so fragile because someone thinks different than them then i have no words for them death comes to us all and we should grieve but we should also move on some people only choose to see the goodness in this world and i choose not to ignore the ugliness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they dont think it be like it is but it do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sweet baby jesus that picture is cute never owned a dachshund but i have always wanted to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can sort of confirm live slightly west of melbourne australia is here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you i definitely will i love seeing places from a locals perspective when i visit their cities its way better than the usual touristy shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats better than i thought
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can accept that but no more stone eating deal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no but i can name living things that can go more than a week at most without hydration if you include special circumstances most and maybe all living things can go more than a week without hydration including humans in special circumstances
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i took the post to mean minutes from the beginning of oxygen being cut off rather than from the point of death i dont know if even thats accurate though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which unfortunately doesnt bring their son back but hopefully all the adults there will never be in charge of watching kids ever again i always thought all school employees were trained in cpr apparently not but that would be ideal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everyone else is shitty might as well join them dont understand that logic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well lets see been a redditor for almost years not to mention i survived the aol chat room days im familiar with the general douchebaggery of the internet but this is uplifting news where even a cynical bitch like myself can come to escape the depravity and depressing reality of life in general and see a glimmer of hope in humanity so you can take your thinly veiled sarcasm and shove it where the sun dont shine and stay off the disney message boards lest you want a visit from chris hansen did i do it did i internet right s the internet the only place youll get ripped on for defending a group of grieving pet owners
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you sound really proud of yourself for having the intellect to defend being a douchebag but youre still a douchebag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh dont be dickey
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you or have you owned other dogs specifically have you owned bigger dogs we have a dachshund and while we absolutely love him and he loves us these dogs undeniably have their own way of doing things for starters they were bred as small game hunters they can be pretty demanding and let you know what they want through lots of barking ive had several bigger dogs and never once felt like we had any issues with training them properly all really well behaved calm and never bark at us without a really good reason this dachshund though if someone even dares walk past the house hes in the window yelling his head off when its playtime he goes way over the line in viciousness to the point youd think he was defending a kill from competition actual hard bites are rare and always seem accidental but do happen something i never experienced with bigger gentler dogs and having lots of friends and neighbors with dogs as well ive just come to the conclusion that smaller dogs just tend to be little assholes far more often than big dogs do barking at people aggressive and at times annoying i would absolutely recommend you to find an older dachshund and spend time with it before committing to a breed you arent fully experienced with then again maybe we just got an asshole and theres lots of quiet calm nonaggressive dachshunds out there and didnt we get lucky
UpliftingNews,not_removed,used to be much much worse but then we to hijack australias network
UpliftingNews,not_removed,please label these circumstances
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought cpr instructions over the phone were common enough now if not in your area hopefully that can be changed even having the call taker talk a completely untrained person through doing chest compressions is vastly better than just waiting for paramedics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh dear seems weve hit a nerve its not shitty or an attack to state you personal belief the original comment stated i think and some reference about the dead becoming dust then everyone got their pink ruffled panties in a twist i think flying spaghetti monster will make you all pay for your lack of faith until then might be time to tone it down a little
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is no point in arguing with the ignorant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dachshunds were bred to be tough fighting against badgers in tunnels and shit so dont think of a dachshund as a little dog think of him as a stocky gladiator they are rough dogs but they will protect you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah ive had all kinds of dogs mostly bigger dogs lbs i lived with a relative for a while who owned one a dachshund so i kinda had a dachsy in a way already i guess you are right to give such cautious advice without a doubt but i know what i would be getting into for some reason the annoying dogs with stubborn attitudes are the ones i go for lol i admire them they live their lives the way they want to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh experience varies my dachshund is the worst guard dog in the world if someone was robbing the house hed wonder why they werent paying him any attention he rarely barks and loves everyone same with a buddys dachshund all ive come across are loveable little hot dogs though i have indeed heard stories about them being a little difficult because of the background of the breed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,australias network probably why its still pretty terrible s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,modern science is amazing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not sure what you mean by label but any circumstance that sufficiently slows evaporation andor metabolism would work for example unconscious humans have often survived longer than a week without hydration in cold humid environments in caves both conscious and unconscious humans have survived several weeks without hydration of course most marine life does not require any hydration like land life does because they live in water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can you be more specific about one of the cases where someone survived several weeks without water people generally lose as much water though their breath and their skin as their urine presumably cold humid air could reduce those losses but going from one week to several sounds rather incredible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you couldve not been a douche about it and just went right to that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,days isolated in a prison cell they say it was an accident he was forgotten but that is ridiculous people are murdered in prisons in natural ways so no one will be held responsible for the murder this says dying people in a weakened state at the end of life can survive a week incapacitated and under full medical observation no cheating the longest case i personally am aware of was a teen lost in a cave if i remember correctly he survived around a week before someone found him ive forgotten the details but it was a freakofnature case that most people would not survive it was attributed to cold and humidity in the cave it fits with the more reliable information about endoflife survival up to a week before death i couldnt find anything much over week other than the prison case probably riddled with lies most of them were obviously unreliable so it appears up to week is possible but unlikely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry about that it wasnt my intention to upset you im not sure what gave you that impression but the impersonal nature of a blinking cursor online is usually to blame im sure wed probably be friends offline
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the vast majority of living things that are both conscious and active do require relatively frequent rehydration to maintain both health and proper motor skills needed to survive and be proactive in this world that we all live in i was speaking under the impression this was going to be assumed i should stop assuming that the average reddit user will be reasonable with their thought patterns and assume dissection of any lack of detail will assuredly follow suit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,omg i need that tshirt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because indians enjoy pomp and ceremony just as much as they enjoy doing things additionally india has a lot of people so this stuff is just a way of standing out by saying look at me im doing things too anyway these guys have signed an mou which is usually the first in many steps towards a binding contract it shows theyre some level of serious about it if i was you id take cognizance of what sub im in and give them a little credit for having their hearts in the right place and hoping something materializes out of it you know instead of vapidly generalizing a whole country of more people than you can visualize
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when light of watts per square meter – about the average intensity reaching the earths surface maybe that average is including night time and the poles sun intensity hitting the ground during day time is about that

UpliftingNews,not_removed,first cat they tried it with was black it was unfortunate idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets just hope the cats not black
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people dont realize that only a small percentage of crime gets to the front pages of the news cops go through terrible stress and anxietythey see hell on earth every single day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im just glad the kitten wasnt black

UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the most cliche thing i have ever read
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why a cat its a police station so shouldnt a dog be more masculine to have around

UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont be acting like that wouldnt be an improvement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cats use their saliva to clean their fur and then once they shed that fur it becomes allergy central a proper cat brush can drastically reduce allergies to a cat and cats love being pampered also an antihistimene nasal spray is good to use to reduce sneezing source used to be allergic to cats but no longer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im allergic to cats and have of them a few things become semiimmune to your own cats think of living with them as getting allergy shots keep your hands away from your eyes after petting a cat im usually fine until i go to rub my eye and then im like yupstill allergic to cats they are my best buds worth the extra kleenex

UpliftingNews,not_removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikichiefmousertothecabinetoffice helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the cat got ratted out you see i suspect the union boss but an anonymous source who commented anonymously because they were not authorized to talk about it named the stations caged rat population as the source of the complaint another officer commented anonymously because she was not authorized to speak in any topic named the departments new rookies as the squealers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is nonsense black kittens are irresistibly cute
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i wasnt poor i would give you gold
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but why its uplifting that more pets are being included for morale improvement in these places

UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol by that logic all dogs start off as cats because ive never seen a pound newborn puppy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,captain holt sergeant jeffords boyle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some days shes fine and lets him pet her and others she hisses and runs in the other direction i guess its just a love hate relationship
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am so seriousligh you guys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,terrible pun and i love it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can confirm rescued my cat from almost getting run over he claws at me everytime i walk past him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think he just misses sitting on trash
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats when you work with them to show them that youre a good human who has food and pets and wont hurt them or abuse them or yell at them when they have an accident or break something or mess up ive met many a dog in the shelter i used to volunteer at that would have a big sign on the cage doesnt like men by the time i was done with them usually a couple of day spanning a week theyd be as happy and as attention seeking and begging for walkies from myself and much more trusting of myself and often of most other men animals are animals just like people sure some dogs retain triggers throughout their entire lives but when you adopt one and get to know them such triggers become obvious or youre able to see that theyre about to act badly when they encounter a trigger previously unknown to you they dont just suddenly go off there is always a reason and most people can work to mitigate such reasons through training loving and care
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more like purrtrol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,copycatthat was in the article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,psh thats bullshit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,buuuuut cheeeeiiiiiiffffff

UpliftingNews,not_removed,so true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i used to itch and wheeze as a kid around cats got a cat was probably a really bad couple of months no longer allergic to cats
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well like they say once you go black

UpliftingNews,not_removed,the exterminatorspest control union sues the us police corpus cats are stealing their clients jobs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i support this punishment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dear god why
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dogpuppy catkitten
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boyle never calls jake peralta so either jeffords or holt jeffords doesnt usually call jake peralta either though unless hes talking about him to holt which points to holt as the potential speaker which i would accept if not for the exclamation mark holt rarely says things in a way that would lead me to use an exclamation mark in transcribing so if the exclamation mark were a period i would say holt for sure but if it said jake instead of peralta i would say jeffords for sure and while i can pretty easily see holt saying the line i can even more easily see jeffords saying it yes i recently binged
UpliftingNews,not_removed,terry hates cats
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my immediate reaction was holt though now youve said it i can also see sergeant jeffords saying this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no kitty thats a bad kitty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the only cats ive had that do that are the most recent couple that are both strays that just showed up and stayed no other of the few cats ive had did this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn son you got me that would also explain why he likes to shove his face in mine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt say dogs cant be rehabilitated i said they can be dangerous if they come from an abusive past and thats true some simply cant be rehabilitated because their psychological damage is too much just like with humans and that sucks but it doesnt change the fact that dogs suffering mental illness whether treatable or not can be dangerous i love dogs and wish i had the time for one i dont im not getting a dog unless i can devote time to play and walk it but ive seen too many kids get hurt by dogs who werent raised or trained right that risk is higher if the dog comes from an abusive past its just something people should be aware of and consider before inviting guests over or bringing children around who dont think dogs will retaliate when pestered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,key word added to his comment edit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats ok i wouldnt have room in my purrrrse for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that just means your cat is trying to find another way to kill you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well a cat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shits and giggles
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dog puppy cat kitten get it right you monster
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good show though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,peralta youre a genius
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good detective work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read it in jake prentending to be holt like having a fake argument with himself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about diaz
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but loooves his yogurt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont lean on the door frame terry caused structural damage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they only sent it to mock me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah terry doesnt like kitties he thinks theyd kill us all if they were smart enough to use weapons he also called some kittens dicks so im going with holt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read it as peralta impersonating holt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,surely jeffords would be against a cat due to the bullying occurred in regards to them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but im pawsome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a really frisky one apparently
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for sure very enjoyable

UpliftingNews,not_removed,so we should just call it the scouts then because boy scouts implies xy chromosomes and a male mindset exclusively the scouts just merge boy and girl scouts already
UpliftingNews,not_removed,future shoutout to the first person to become the highest level girl scout and eagle scout
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but still not atheists
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not uplifting a girl whos young and confused will only be confused more by this decision it doesnt help them and it doesnt help others around them and reading the article it seems like theyre being forced to do this by laws and lawsuits
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god fucking damnit tumblr quit your shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just a question but do they have to go through with the sex change first it might be awkward if they didnt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a very bad idea i think if you remember what your mindset was when you were a developing adolescent youd realize why hormones run rampant and lead to bad decision making i think people who want integration of the sexes think im an adult and could handle myself but completely ignore how irrational preteens and teenagers are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow really how would they even know that i dont remember being asked anything about religion when my son was a scout
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im pretty sure this is untrue i had a few friends in boyscouts that were athiest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are surgeons really supposed to put peepees on little girls and call them boys this world is fucked up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,itd lead to less young men being frog posting virgins
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was a proud webelo was told not to join the next level due to my lack of a judeochristian god it is their policy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some individual troops might allow it but the national organization is against it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont agree with it especially doing it to a kid but its not our call
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for providing a source even one with an apparent bias rather than us just trading anecdotal evidence

UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpimgurcomalyxmm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its important to remind people that they are just focusing on a little smudge on a gigantic crystal clear window this kind of stuff happens all the time and is the norm though its a dog bites man story im still upvoting because people need to be reminded that its actually uncommon and unnatural for man bites dog even though its the headline they see the most
UpliftingNews,not_removed,robb stark and his crew were invited to a community meal as well hmmm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are the closest thing to it currently afaik you dont really hear about extreme christian groups only extreme christian individuals doing something crazy like that dude who shot up that camp of kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a trap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everyone making jokes about the red wedding but we celebrate april fools day because crusaders invited muslims to a treaty and slaughtered them under that pretense woe verily the propoganda has worked better than i thought sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not gonna let anyone dictate my religion to me or tell me who i hate or dont hate my opinion about your relationship with god is as irrelevant as how i feel about your favourite ice cream flavor live your life and know that a muslim who believes in every tenant of islam and every true teaching of its prophet believes in your right to be who you are and be as free as you want to be in islam we believe god made human beings superior to angels because he gave us the choice to do right or wrong whereas they have no choice what theocracy imam bishop rabbi or priest then has the right to tell you that the same god would rather you not have that right a true muslim has love for all and hatred for none and i hope every member of the lgbt community and every other group recognises that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a trap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why arent any of these muslims speaki oh nevermind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,call me when lgbt people are invited to a meal without consequences in saudi arabia or mecca
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those irish eating people they dislike has always seemed like a modest proposal to them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sadly when the overwhelming narrative is about a small number of extremists in a particular population the stories about normal everyday people in that particular population seem special
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree completely i wish there were a way to influence the media to start changing the narrative thats going to take some work though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,started with a bang
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why would ecumenism ever be regarded as uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure this is a trap sure its actually a free meal i like those odds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,beware hopefully they dont lock the doors and set fire to the room i jest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why would anyone go to that meal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what do they hope to prove i woudl rather see them lend their weight to a rally or some kind of public cause inviting them over for dinner is like the queens way of saying yes you are now officially on the radar not well enough to have a regular seat at my table but just enough to have my recognition that is all you may have good day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my only question is where are all the other extremists of other religions i dont hear anything about jews going to saudi arabia and shooting up an airport i dont see anything about hindus going to dubai and taking out skyscrapers with stolen planes why are all the extremists muslim
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats nice to hear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i find that we post this as an uplifting article that it reinforces that look there are some good muslims out there when in reality the vast majority have no issue living in western cultures
UpliftingNews,not_removed,religious recruitment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,an overwhelming community of muslims hate gays the who dont doesnt change the fact the other do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,meanwhile probably dozens of gays have been killed by muslims all over the world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you really think anyone smart is going to take that as true taqiyya is grave and real
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so they are luring them in for some good ol islamic justice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a trap

UpliftingNews,not_removed,you fucking made my day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminds me of the red wedding from game of thrones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is normal for the western world dont think they are so nice in the middle east and i certainly dont understand why its a bad thing to acknowledge that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sadly when the overwhelming narrative is about a small number of extremists in a particular population the stories about normal everyday people in that particular population seem special
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you prefer this or just reading about the effects of extremists i think right now the attitude in the world can be improved by showing positive things done by muslims not because it is not normal but because people get a false image of what normal muslims do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am a gay muslim sometimes i eat with myself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i want to be friends with those guys thats just damn awesome of them wow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if they are aware of that there is pig in chewing gum candy and medicines they are taking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cuz pplz thinkz muslams are baddies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its uplifting because it satisfies all the neoliberalssjw of reddit which is like of reddit users so its technically uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everybody hates vegans haha they make it hard for normal people to like them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought the same and i have add so my attention weaned a bit as a result of that lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reddit athiestsedgy teenager logic anyone who is part of a religion shouldnt modernize and must follow everything their holy text says because its their religion and fuck them for following and believing in every single word of their holy text
UpliftingNews,not_removed,heres the thing this would be uplifting if it occurred in the middle east or africa the fact that it happened in ireland is utterly normal why do muslims only act tolerant when they are an extreme minority in otherwise tolerant societies why does this never happen in muslim communities outside of europe or america these are the questions we need to ask
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reddit a huge percent in fact a majority of muslims hate the lgbt community small group of muslims we dont hate muslims you haha look how stupid reddit is for ignoring this insignificant proportion of muslims so small an insignificant that their existence makes the news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reddit muslims hate the lgbt community muslims not all heres an example of muslims who dont reddit good for them but muslim majority countries are extremely shitty towards the lgbt and polling shows that a large proportion of muslims have extremely terrible attitudes towards lgbt regressive leftists are you kidding me thats racist whataboutchristianity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the muslim mayor of london also lead our lgbt pride march this week
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is only one side the same moderates supporting the gays are the same people who wouldnt if they lived in shariah law just look at that recent interview with a muslim imam or that recording of muslims in a mosque agreeing with crap like killing infidels this isnt uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i came here for thiswas not disappointed take httpiimgurcomujjudsdgif
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant help but wonder if this was a double layered joke considering the fact that male to female transvestites who could easily pass as naturally born women are sometimes known as traps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the opposite is true the muslims in western countries are a tiny clean speck on a filthy window
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well that was like years ago so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep after theyd laid siege to and occupied most of southern europe whilst slaughtering dissenters and nonabrahamic resisters to conversion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fucking idiot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah okay butuhthey arent real muslims i read that email my grandma forwarded so i know theyre not actually allowed to be muslim okay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mecca is in saudi arabia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its ireland youre more likely to be shot or blown up by the ira then be killed in a homophobic attack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are goose stepping around talking about the need to cleanse their country of minorities
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who started the first world war which killed million and injured that includes million civilians who started the second world war which killed over million which was over of the world population who killed about million of aborigines in australia who drop the nuclear bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki which killed people in hiroshima and in nagasaki who killed more than million red indians in north america who killed more than million indian in south america who took about million african people as slaves and when of them died threw them into the atlantic ocean not all extremists are muslim but any extremism isnt good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres westboro baptist church but they arent smart enough to organize something like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its closer to httpsenwikipediaorgwikilgbtinislamopinionpolls of muslims who dont think homosexuality is immoral of course its not very impressive but its significantly more than
UpliftingNews,not_removed,islam is a terrible religion regarding lgbt and most muslims have a terrible attitude towards lgbt so its nice to see some muslims are being tolerant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,islam is a terrible religion regarding lgbt and most muslims have a terrible attitude towards lgbt so its nice to see some muslims are being tolerant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because a lot of misinformed people about islam need to know
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre going to make a shit joke can you at least make an original shit joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is that depressing is ireland only supposed to be populated by irish christianscatholics or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a funny and i thought that was muslim
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was the jokereference mate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont think they are so nice in the middle east and i certainly dont understand why its a bad thing to acknowledge that the dinner wasnt in the middle east it was in dublin how nice are people in dublin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know if youre talking about terrorism or homophobia because homophobia is heavily ingrained in islam same sex marriage is illegal in all majority muslim nations where same sex intercourse is only legal in of the and while technically legal gays still routinely face persecution and violence the only nations on earth that execute homosexuals for the crime of being gay are majority muslim this is true for muslims in western nations as well over of muslims in the uk think homosexuality should be illegal and punished
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you really believe that only a small number of extremists believe that gays should be killed for being gay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminder that of british muslims wanting ting sharia law in the uk isnt a small minority
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i just feel like we shouldnt reinforce that narrative
UpliftingNews,not_removed,by small do you mean sizable and by a particular population do you mean multiplie countries
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you are taken in by the narrative that is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what do you define as normal if by normal you mean what the majority does then i have news for you over of muslims in the uk believe homosexuality should be illegal that number shoots up to something around for year old muslim men also small minority of british muslims believe sharia law should be enforced in the uk if you however define normal as being what is considered normal for western society then of course normal would behave this way because you have already described them as normal that doesnt mean the religion as a whole behaves in a way that is considered normal by westerners
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think right now the attitude in the world can be improved by showing positive things done by national socialists every idealist in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,medicines are fine to take if theyre needed and you can get no pig candy and gum
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i actually asked about this this stuff falls under the best effort idea apparently the way it works is as long as they trieddidnt know then they are fine its a best effort type deal i guess as an atheist i dont really get it just like i dont get the nonsense christians believe in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,come to rtumblrinaction if you are fed up with the neoliberal sjws
UpliftingNews,not_removed,taqqiya
UpliftingNews,not_removed,perhaps those who leave and end up as the minority in foreign countries do so because they do not agree with the old majority in their home nations who discriminate that way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aside from religion what tends to be the difference between places like the middle east and europe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,take this with a grain of salt because my only source is my gun loving bible thumping brother but allegedly there are different ways of acting for muslims based on population saturation in the extreme minority they are extremely peaceful and tolerant once they build their numbers they become more extreme to the point where when they have a majority they behave the way you see in saudi arabia and places like that its a method of infiltrating new societies and slowly taking over part of the plan for global domination
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably has something to do with not wanting to be dropped off a tower block going to prison or having their head removed in the country theyre from if i lived in a place where the punishment for supporting gays was losing your head then i wouldnt run around supporting gays either
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does this type of thing happen in christian communities do christian centres invite specifically the lgbt community for dinner
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when youre so psyched for your shot at an epic librul shutdown that you dont even bother reading what you typed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you knocked that scarecrows head clear across the room with that one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so every muslim tolerant of the lgbt community is pandering just wow bigoted beliefs in major religions hasnt been and still isnt exclusive to islam the doctrine of the other major religions isnt exactly tolerant and isnt evolved much beyond that of islam its the people that are leading that charge toward tolerance believe it or not the same is happening in the muslim world just at a slower rate calling them panderers doesnt help accelerate the progress
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what you cant just say something as ridiculous and ludicrous as islam and western civilisation being incompatible like its true in fact most of this comment is just you saying stuff without elaborating on anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sorry youre going to be downvoted for telling the truth by people clamoring for citations and such despite having the reality of islam beamed to their phones on demand how unfortunate that none of them have ever lived in a country that adheres to sharia law never smelled the death and shit that emanates from a body hung for all to see as an example they will have seen people thrown to their death for being gay yet decry any besmirchment of an ideology that does not even recognize choicebecause choosing anything other than what the ideology dictates is an insult to allah hence no choice how many that will insult your comment have read anything by bill warner or even know who he is the accommodating minds of the uneducated and ignorant willfully encourage importation of death and enslavement through immigration and politically correct sycophantic diatribe as they refuse the very truth that is delivering their doom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,islam under any interpretation does not approve of lgbt lifestyles uh so does christianity the bible explicitly makes calls for the persecution of gay people several times in fact yet here you are only telling one side of the story if tolerant muslims are just faking it pandering to the masses then you should go talk to my gay muslim friends or the thousands of people that marched in gay pride parades in lebanon and turkey both muslim countries sure muslim theocracies are fucked up and intolerant youre right about that but to generalize based on those theocracies is pretty ignorant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you sound like a conspiracy theory nutcase by the way presumptions left and right fuckin anti semite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey so i have three muslim friends who are fine with lgbt people have gay friends etc so do they secretly loathe them all will they execute them once the global islamic caliphate comes to power i mean i know your sweeping generalization of billion people cant be too far off but i feel like i know my friends pretty well so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can tell you from personal experience that this is not true i have lived under shariah law myself and i support lgbt persons i certainly agree that agreeing with killing infidels is crap but i know it isnt a representative view of islam because i have lived in many islamic countries myself as a christian is a more representative statement by muslims
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because siding with gays in a muslim country would get them killed didnt think that one needed to be explained but apparently it does there was catholic priests in america supporting what happened in orlando
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they live under a dictatorship what the fuck else do you expect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,has there ever been a gay pride parade in a muslim majority country yes is there a single muslim country that allows gays equal legal rights yes in fact there are five of them i tend to agree with you on the last statement just as i do when it is made regarding christianity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre a talker
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the local mosque in my town consists of very friendly people and theyre constantly giving back to the community not uncommon for them and the local synagogues and churches to do charity work fund raisers and have rallies calling for world peace go outside and look at the world around you more than reading negative propaganda on the internet and youll see that the world isnt as fucked up as youre making it out to be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wasnt the caliphate of cordoba one of the most diverse regions in the medieval period when it comes to ethnicity and religion ethnic arabs occupied the top of the social hierarchy muslims had a higher social standing than jews who had a higher social standing than christians christians and jews were considered dhimmis required to pay jizya a tax for the wars against christian kingdoms in the north the word of a muslim was valued more than that of a christian or jew in court and some offenses were harshly punished when a jew or christian was the perpetrator against a muslim the same offenses were permitted when the perpetrator was a muslim and the victim a nonmuslim half of the population in córdoba is reported to have been muslim by the century with an increase to percent by the century this was due less to local conversion than to muslim immigration from the rest of the iberian peninsula and north africa this combined with the mass expulsions of christians from córdoba after a revolt in the city explains why during the caliphate cordoba was the greatest muslim centre in the region jewish immigration to córdoba also increased at this time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that isnt even remotely true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in dublin in ridiculous statement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youve a pretty skewed view of ireland if you think youre more likely to be attacked in by a terrorist than by a homophobe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man the ira sound like real thugs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was any of this over religion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,none of those deal with religion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah my mistake but again yes that is still a massive margin of people who are not accepting of gays
UpliftingNews,not_removed,need to know what
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no not true look at some stats
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes and ethnic irish how would say congolese feel if right after native americans established their reservation rights tons of swedes or chinese started moving in probably pretty crappy right let ireland be irish ffs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant think of a single african language that is on the verge of extinction because of colonialism i can think of two languages in the british isles alone that are thats my point ireland doesnt need multiculturalism while it is still fighting to regain its own cultural identity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is this where we do the whoosh thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont watch got i just youtube the endings down vote away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,source
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pray tell me what goes on in my suburb of london how is this ignorant nonsense upvoted our mayor here is a muslim man who just lead our lgbt pride event and has spoken about making sure an iconic gay bar is recognised as such just the week before that please fuck off in pretending you even know wtf goes on here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,approve of homosexuality thats from a statistically significant gallup survey and the subsequent generations of muslims are more antiwest not less were literally importing pakistan into britain devoid of significant assimilation or the adoption of classical liberal values
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same with devout christians
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol you cant really believe that only muslims countries discriminate against gay people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,luckily christianty also has a shithole assbackwards part of the world it lays claim to sub saharan africa so in many ways its just as shitty a religion in its negative effects on the world as islam if in different spheres and affecting the world differently but it isnt as good of a headline so everybody just forgets about that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i believe the number of muslims who are extremist enough that they believe that gay people should be killed for being gay is small especially in places like dublin were you unable to parse that meaning from how i originally phrased it or are you one of those people who automatically assume the extremist element is the population at large
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well thats not exactly accurate thats of british muslims in ten years ago who felt that they should be able to appeal to sharia law councils in muslim communities in the uk thats not the same as wanting to institute sharia law as the law of the land in the uk unlike for example christian extremists in the us who want to do just that that poll was done at a time when the british muslim community that felt that british society was not serving their needs and still were feeling alienated over foreign policy that had marginalized and demonized thus their position was not indicative so much of how many muslims in the uk were extremist as it is that the muslim community was looking for a way to serve their unmet needs a more recent poll done just this year shows that number has actually dropped to i think it can be demonstrated that the farther you get away from the war on terror of the early the lower that number will drop actual estimates of extremists by organizations like the rand corporation show less than one percent of muslims would fall under the definition of extremist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminder that london has a muslim mayor and its people like you who scare us not him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think that submitting examples like this does the opposite of reinforcing that narrative news generally doesnt report on anything but the bad exceptions to the rule so having examples of positive interactions between muslims and gays for example is an attempt to readjust our negative views about the world as a whole as reinforced by mainstream news i definitely know where youre coming from though reporting issues like this does make this seem like an exception in the same way that submissions about the actions of extremists do but even if this action isnt uncommon at least it helps provide a better representation of the world were living in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree completely i wish there were a way to influence the media to start changing the narrative thats going to take some work though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i live in saudi arabia as a us expat and no one here that i have met has anything but disdain and disgust for isis i think that you are badly and dangerously misinformed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well over half of muslims worldwide support isis and their stated goals bullshit httpmetrocosmcomsupportisismuslimworldperceptionsvsreality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,less than one percent or according to all educated estimates thats a lot less than hundreds of millions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean less than one percent of the billion muslims worldwide or thats according to estimates from the rand corporation and pew research so no i dont mean sizable i mean exactly what i said which is based upon the numbers not on the hysteria
UpliftingNews,not_removed,acts of religious violence arent that rare these days hell they arent even restricted to islamic majority countries any more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if only that were true and even if it is there is still a problem often it is the children of immigrants who are more radical and prone to terrorism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the most obvious difference is obviously the relatively small number of muslims compared to the middle east aside from that the only difference is the culture and society built and refined by europeans over centuries for some reason it is easier for some cultures to assimilate than others
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rconspiracy is leaking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah that seems to be the case there arent any muslim majority countries with modern values perhaps turkey but they are now becoming more islamic after a century of secularization
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly but change has to start somewhere like i said id consider this uplifting if it happened in saudi arabia or iran or jordan etc it happened in ireland which is incredibly liberal by global standards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably at liberal churches like methodists or unitarians certainly at most churches they are welcome to come worship
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not a strawman thats literally how some people respond
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is no progress in islam they are and have always been stuck in a mindset fit for the crusades youre fooling yourself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but it is does us law or the laws of any modern country support stoning honor killings and all the other parts of shariah law too many muslims have these beliefs for it to simply be ignored
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where does the bible call for persecution leviticus forbids jews from sodomy and paul talked about it being a sin but where is the call for persecution jesus preached forgiveness and tolerance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeahbut islam has no comparative scripture for love thy neighbor as yourself christianity is about turning the other cheek islam is about slapping it just compare their leaders jesus had huge masses of followers but refused to fight back and was martyred muhammad killed a bunch of people took a bunch of wives and started a kingdom thats a huge freaking difference
UpliftingNews,not_removed,heh this guy good job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then they dont heed the words of their holy prophet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre making a sweeping generalization of billion people too your just doing it the other way and based solely on an anecdotal evidence because you know what muslims thats nothing percent of all muslims thats such a tiny fraction that its not even worth bringing into the argument
UpliftingNews,not_removed,give me a source on the catholic priests supporting the shooting in orlando
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre gonna have to source that one for me buddy i know the completely reviled wbc was happy about it but catholics have a unified doctrine which explicitly condemns persecution against lbgt people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i believe this was an american mosque though im not sure as the man speaking spoke english
UpliftingNews,not_removed,take a trip to turkey egypt kuwait pakistan bangladesh saudi arabia iran etc go to one of those countries then come back and tell me i dont know what im talking about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes except nonabrahamic religious were killed and nonmuslim abrahamics were secondclass citizens on the level of scum as your paragraph entails
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow yeah that really sounds like nonmuslims were treated well s fucking retard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in ireland i was joking ive been there for saint paddies day also the ira were terrorists so youre not wrong and im not wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,terrorists really
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and in year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that they are misinformed and need to form their own opiniongo talk to muslims got to mosques and talk to the people and validate your assumptions and turn off the tv
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can you please point me to some articles and with all due respect not from theblaze and the like that back up this statement like i want actual credible verified statistics from an unbiased source please and thank you edit so someone makes a bold statement and i get downvoted for asking for proof gotta love reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,million out of billion people by that logic white people want to kill you just because america likes to bomb the fuck out of civilians doesnt mean its true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no please dont quote actual evidence it wont fit their narrative of islam
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im pretty sure ireland is still majority irish and im not seeing how a tiny community of muslims will somehow impact any attempts by the irish people to save or reclaim their own culture
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are a bad person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,donald trump fansites as someone living in one of these apparently sharia law zones hes speaking out of his ass and im disgusted hes upvoted on a supposed uplifting news subreddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of british muslims approve of homosexuality thats from a statistically significant gallup survey thats all i needed to know to better understand how significant and rare this news is thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like you even approve liberal values dont nitpick some ideological value to further your agenda what you and the likes of you doing is as disgusting as the radical muslims did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not really they dont execute homosexuals on basis of christianity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never said that i mentioned in another comment how homosexuals are persecuted in christian majority countries mainly in africa the distinction is that as a whole majority muslim countries execute or imprison homosexuals at a scale that no other countries regardless of religion do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a terrible argument against his point other countries do that too that doesnt justify the behavior and he didnt even say other countries do not persecute gays he was making a point that islam i general is extremely intolerant of gays its a backwards religion that needs to let go of the past and come into the modern world some sects have begun to make this change but we need to keep criticizing and ridiculing the ones who havent until they get with the program
UpliftingNews,not_removed,subsaharan africa doesnt have upwards of one million people and isnt by and large opposed to the western world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you have census results from muslims in dublin because i have them from muslims in other places in the world including the uk and they show a very large portion of the community holds these beliefs why do you believe only a minority holds these beliefs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminder that just because your muslim mayor is not an extremist or a bad muslim but some still are you cant take one guy and say see this guy integrated into our culture fine anyone who says muslims can be bad are harmful its just stupid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i find that we post this as an uplifting article that it reinforces that look there are some good muslims out there when in reality the vast majority have no issue living in western cultures
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this research seems to show a lot more muslims supporting sharia law
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the young are always easier to manipulate but it is also the children of immigrants who are also more open to new ideas its all about how and where they are raised
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is very true and your second sentence is wrong also by the second or third generation the children are much more in tune to the culture around them there are always exceptions but that is just that the exception not the rule
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the guardian
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not only is that limited to one country you are pretty much discrediting the other of muslims in the uk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,look its not the religion that creates the people its the people that creates the religion if there are more and more jack muslims that are tolerant of modern beliefs then thats still progress embrace the good in the world dont damn it as being fake
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im only seeing one person stuck in a mindset at the moment youre lazily giving in to propaganda and becoming blinded by an unjustified hatred do you really not see how much the discourse regarding muslims mirrors that of jews in europe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont go outside and talk to people much do you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,doesnt the bible say women should be stoned to death if she were to cheat if so we shouldnt allow christians in office based on your muslim argument
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but isnt us law based off christian views so your argument would then be that us law shouldnt be influenced by any religion period
UpliftingNews,not_removed,leviticus if there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman both of them have committed a detestable act they shall surely be put to death their bloodguiltness is upon them right love and forgiveness totally compatible with the idea that gay people should be put to death im not excusing intolerant aspects of islam only pointing out that theyre not exclusive to islam
UpliftingNews,not_removed,twenty years ago did gays have equal rights in a single christianmajority country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is disingenuous you are implying that somehow muslim countries are somehow less supportive of the rights of gays because they are muslim in fact the countries i cited are countries without a history of western colonialism to shape their laws if you are going to be an advocate for justice you need to be just in your judgments i encourage you to study your history which is easily available through google rather than asking questions you think you know the answer to without any study or experience of them i wonder if you know that the hanafi school of islamic jurisprudence the largest in the sunni world calls for no punishment whatsoever for gays this is in sharp contrast to the historical situation in most western countries the fact is that our human history of the treatment of minorities continues to be less than praiseworthy and calling out one group that you arent a member of for their behavior is counterproductive at best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i live in saudi arabia you dont know what you are talking about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah because the terrorists there dont oppress the muslims in that region at all in fact all the locals totally back them up and arent being murdered by them on a daily basis i dont even know why youre bringing them up youre on rupliftingnews take your negative bullshit somewhere else
UpliftingNews,not_removed,abrahamics were secondclass citizens on the level of scum as your paragraph entails definitely not what the paragraph states its a level of integration that was very rare in those times the jews lived with the christians but were subjected to bloody pogroms and harassment and ive read that muslims could live in merchant republics such as venice and other trading hotspots it wasnt perfect equality but then again what can you compare it against that was more or equally diverse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what are you comparing it to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dublin has an average of under murders a year in total there isnt people getting shot all the time the ira primarily works up north
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah the ira are the terrorists i was referring to in my comment but i guess i missed the joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these days they are just drug dealers using the name to strike fear in rivals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these are statistical facts if doesnt matter how you feel about it im sure it probably upset you when that muslim woman was accused of destroying a quran and was killed for it nevertheless it was a small group of radicals that killed her while the majority of people stood by and watched
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when you have ethnicreligious minorities international attention and sympathy instantly shifts towards them because of modern identity politics i just dont want irish culture to have to suffer because of a few people disliking muslims which will end up subsiding their whole identity and theyll end up being cattleprodded into the same bland welcome welcome multiculti cocktail the rest of europe has become
UpliftingNews,not_removed,could you even articulate what liberal values are something tells me you would go sideways in your answer fundamentally its about secular democracy freedom of speechexpression and the liberty of the individual if you think the culture of pakistan or the muslim world more generally comports with these values youre sadly ignorant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they did and if it was legal they would trust me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plenty of places want to and are close to doing so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not anymore maybe though westboro and a few others may have something to say here but if youre talking about the history of most godbased religions you bet your ass that youd have been executed for it sure weve moved on from that now but so have a lot of muslim sects and just like the radicalism that is present in christianity you have it present in the muslim world except that the modern world allows them to act upon that radicalism in a much more extreme way imagine if we had the exact same technology we do now with the same religiousnational divisions we had during the crusades do you really picture the european countries in general as being all that tolerant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in truth you are right but isnt this a step in the right direction as a muslim ive switched degrees on the subject i now stand proudly as a supporter for equal rights across the whole of lgbt community isnt it a good thing that we as muslim moderates are switching to more liberal views to the point where we are ready to reform our religion in order to live in peace with the whole of humanity and embrace universal values btw this isnt a rhetorical question and im not trying to single you out as a biggot or anything like that its just if some of us are willing to actually embrace liberal values shouldnt westerners who feel as you do that minority rights arent being respected support us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except that his point was in reply to my comment about the small number of extremists vs the much larger number of everyday people its entirely acceptable to point out that muslim countries are not at all unique in their approach to homosexuality or their treatment of gay people in general same sex marriage for example may be illegal in all majority muslim nations but it was only last year that it became legal in the us and there are still people in the us that are fighting against that gays may indeed routinely face persecution and violence in muslim countries but thats true of gay people in primarily christian countries as well such as russia he points out that the nations on earth that execute gay people are predominantly muslim but thats not the same as saying that all are muslim his point if its in reaction to my comment is that muslims have cornered the market on homophobia but this is patently untrue homophobia is alive and well all over world and if it seems like its worse in the muslim world thats only because the sociopolitical conditions make it more overtand thats borne out by the fact that in nonmuslim countries where similar sociopolitical conditions exist homophobia flourishes there as well thus ucuddlenigers comment is a perfectly good argument against his point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uganda drc car and south sudan have over people between them and they are the operating grounds of the lra
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminder that you clearly dont seem to be a brit and yet are attempting to use us as your example and that part of your paranoia about muslims is that theyre all here to indoctrinate everyone into being terrorists or sharia law enforcers when a muslim is currently mayor of one of the most diverse cities in the world is fasting for ramadan leading lgbt marches and is also a feminist laughable when ive seen guys like you on reddit claim that guys like him dont integrate into our culture at all yet hes a more decent guy than say someone like trump after one generation hard for someone who lives here to listen to people like you when i know i have zero fears or issues with any of the muslims in this city or those i voted into office
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah thats a fair point i guess i see it as a community going out of their way to welcome lgbtq members as a response to the recent violence which is admirable and somewhat remarkable in light of that muslims living in peace with the lgbtq community is the norm of course but actively reaching out to us may not be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but its fucked up in the us the children of immigrants without exception are always more assimilated than their parents the fact that this is not the case in europe is extremely disconcerting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats true but right now those ideas are more radical rather than less
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not in europe due to high quality of immigrants in the us that is the case but for the low skill muslims who move to europe the children are usually more radical and fundamentalist than their immigrant parents they didnt grow up experiencing the downsides of fundamentalism so they are more likely to be drawn to it for identity reasons
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the poll wasnt conducted by the guardian
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it had a majority though didnt it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i recall jews in europe didnt start a war or blow up buildings because someone drew an offensive picture of abraham
UpliftingNews,not_removed,err i dont think the jews were raping killing and comitting acts of terrorism youre just being brainwashed by the media into thinking all migrants and muslims in general are innocent women and children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not every muslim is stuck in this mindset but the religion itself is and a huge amount of muslims support some terrible crap the ones who act like islam is a religion of peace are no different than some christians who go to church but dont actually believe in god or jesus meaning theyre not actually christians those people arent real muslims
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no a more exact comparison is prohibiting the integration of christian canon law into the legal systems of western countries that is indeed prohibited the concept of separation of church and state is common in western society unlike in the islamic world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really how many cheating women were stoned to death for adultery last year in the us and it isnt a muslim argument it is the truth about islam no argument necessary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hardly the whole point of us law is freedom even gay marriage is legal though some christians dont support it originally i would say the mindsets if the founding fathers is similar to the christian mindset but i dont beleive they were even that religious i may be wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay im not arguing that this isnt offensive it is but this isnt a call to persecute gays the book of leviticus is a book of jewish law jews have never persecuted gentiles for eating pork and they are not called to persecute gentiles for homosexuality for that matter when was the last time this punishment was actually carried out by jews like several hundred years ago leviticus is over two thousand years old i know modern muslims as for christianity christians do not observe the jewish law described in leviticus as far as i can recall the only other time homosexuality is condemned in the bible is by paul but there is no call for persecution im not trying to be rude but i think you are making stuff up to make islam look better than it is i dont appreciate you denigrating christianity and judaism just to make a political point but please correct me if i am mistaken edit typo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,leviticus was written for the levites who were basically the priesthood class of the ancient jews it doesnt apply to the general population nonetheless i get your point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what are your even trying to say
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why am i meant to be doing that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,secular democracy is there any muslim politician in the western world who would oppose that noneif there are they would be hated by both sides freedom of speechexpression and the liberty of the individual there it isthe infamous muh freeze peach argument do you think that would only apply to the likes of you what they were doing is as much expression of speech as you do right now as long as theyre not breaking the lawthey can said anything they want regardless if you dislike it thats why i said you are disgusting to claim some value while not giving the same to everyone else if you think every muslims or certain immigrants are incapable to integrate with western values then you are the most severly brainwashed ignorant here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a christian i dont want to murder anyone thats kinda a big nono we are taught to see homosexual acts not homosexuality as a sin and even then our sins are forgiven were all supposed to support each other nowhere does jesus tell us to hurt anyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can you name them for me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what radicalism present in christianity theyre incomparable christianity doesnt have explicit instructions to slaughter the infidel or to lie to obscure intent or description of how holy warriors get into a better heaven than casual worshipers the first crusades werent even offensive moves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you cant point to the kkk comparing an organization which while extreme that has killed people in their entire existence to a religious extremism which has killed since is incomparable islam isnt necessarily bad but it sure has a knack for breeding it at least more than other religions edit i misread westboro as kkk but my point still stands the westboro baptist church has not killed anyone anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,neatly elucidated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,let me know when the lra starts calling its attacks on american or european soil
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never ever said that i think muslims are trying to indoctrinate anyone and i dont believe that they are all i said was that just because not all of them do a decent amount of muslims that are emigrating to europe and britain do have extremist views
UpliftingNews,not_removed,muslims living in peace with the lgbtq community is the norm of course homosexuality is punishable by death in muslim countries
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre not serious are you there isnt a single islamic country where same sex marriage is legal in well over half muslim majority nations same sex intercourse is illegal as someone the other comment mentioned the only nations on earth where homosexuality is punished by death are majority muslim nations of them you are completely misinformed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i suppose thats true as well i just never really consider lgbtq a separate community were all just canadian the way i look at it one of the couples that comes to our board game night is gay and theyre happily married with a child i dont think of them as the gay couple theyre just insert name and insert name maybe its just that i grew up around it so its so normal for me that it doesnt even register as something people would care about like if i had a kid and they came out to me it would illicit a cool story bro kind of response as if a guy came out to his dad dad i really like having sex with girls which ofcourse would illicit anyone to say umm ok if that makes any sense lol it just seems weird to me that people would need to reach out to the gay community several friends in highschool were gay had a boss that was gay several of my coworkers are gay one of my best friends is gay were all in the same community is what im trying to say so there isnt a reaching out in my mind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,millions of christians still have similar intolerant beliefs moderate peaceful muslims exist you denying that simple yet critical fact is symptomatic of another problem i fear is growing exponentially extremism is the more poignant ugly reality that needs to be addressed whether the extremist has grossly misinterpreted the quran or the bible there religion of choice is moot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the vast majority of muslims and migrants are innocent and peaceful men woman and children unbiased indisputable statistics back that up why does someone offering a different point of view have to be brainwashed by maniacal external sources why do conversations on this subject instantly erupt into insults and shortsighted absolutes accept the possibility that maybe you dont have the only correct answer to this complex problem and enter into a conversation with an open mind im predicting that if youd do that with the members of these groups you claim to know so well you just might have a change of heart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,let me guess youre atheist please tell me more about other peoples religion since you clearly know so much about them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly not to mention that christians at worst protest whereas at worst muslims kill people to get their way and lets not forget that quite a bit of christianity with jesus the guy it was named after is all about kindness peace and not slaughtering infidels
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is a call to persecute gays it explicitly calls for them to be put to death the only reason you dont believe it is is because modern christians have come to their senses about what is morally appropriate i find that im often repeating myself when people point out that muslim theocracies persecute gays i know im not denying that at all you are right but that doesnt change the fact that islam as a religion is really no more or less worse on this issue than the other abrahamic religions im going to repeat myself again i know that muslim theocracies persecute gay people my original comment was meant to show two things first that if youre going to blame islam specifically you cant because christianity judaism are both just as homophobic second that you cant characterize billion people based on the intolerance of these theocracies the user who deleted his comment was asserting that all muslims by virtue of their religion are homophobic he said that any muslim that tries to be tolerant is faking it to pander to the masses now any reasonable person would recognize that this isnt true no sure the theocracies are fucked up but muslim countries like lebanon and turkey are actually fairly lgbt friendly and i dont quite understand why if christians arent meant to follow that scripture then why is it included in their holy book sounds pretty counterintuitive to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe were agreeing to disagree at this point but as this verse can be found in the king james bible i think it applies to all christians
UpliftingNews,not_removed,countries with a combined million people and the three of the least least religious countries on the planet representing about of the christian population if you consider that being proven wrong on an embarrassing scale then i dont think we have the common ground required for a civilized discussion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course my name has iran in it it means iran returned peace corps volunteer i actually have some experience there both pre and post revolution if you are american you are more likely to be imprisoned than an iranian citizen is iran takes in a refugee per every persons in their population for the us the number is there are many ways the us is a more barbaric place end of discussion seems to be an attitude more common to fundamentalist bigots who dont want to look at the truth iran has a much better record in dealing with transgender people than the us does sure they have areas where they need to improve but the us has little room to claim they are better overall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is in total not just shootings which are rare and nobody is getting blown up by the ra these days even the murders by organised crime would be most likely by dublin based gangs in there entire history how many people did the ira blow up in the republic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre either unaware or more likely unwilling to grapple with the data on what european muslims think of freedom of speech a horrifying percentage sympathize with the charlie hebdo massacre and what that represented but considering that you just equated me a moment ago with islamic terrorists i think this discussion is beyond merit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not jesus but its still in old and new testament if a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman both of them have committed an abomination they shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them god gave them over to a reprobate mind without natural affection they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them romans im christian too by the way but im tired of this religious arrogance all holy books are just as nasty as eachother no religion is kinder more accepting or just better we all have our skeletons in the closet and they need to be put behind us if we want to accomplish anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,were not talking about you though are we we have to look at how a group as a whole would behave in the same sort of situation as the group were comparing them to in this case if christians as a group were placed in the same situation and conditions as muslims in the muslim world would they behave the same places like uganda and jamaica indicate that christians would be just as happy to behave the same way as muslims
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uganda for a start
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what religious history have you studied christianity did all those things thats what rhe crusades were besides a money making ploy for many and they explicitly promised a ticket into heaven if you died fighting the muslim infidel threat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can point to them they are of an era where lynching was propped up as the lords work its an example of the religion being used to justify persecution and its more than just that era of us history it was used against the native americans blacks gays communists the mentally ill and foreigners it was used in africa and elsewhere during colonialism the scoreboard doesnt matter you cannot use well we killed less people than them as a defense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and you are right as a muslim i publicly acknowledge the problem im of moroccan descent and i know for a fact that my country of origin is going through a crossroad on one side we have organizations that seek to help the lgbt community but on the other hand just recently some people invaded a gay couples place and beat them senselessly for having sex with each other worst part they are the ones facing a prison sentence but i think something that really can help us westerners understand the issue over there is to communicate on the same level people in muslim countries see homosexuality as a fetish not as a sexual orientation they see them as having a fixation with the same sex and not a natural tendency towards the same sex once you explain that it helps understand the medium of communication to use to help solve the problem also and more importantly muslim countries have in no way shape or form gone through civil rights movement or any similar things their independence movements were fraudulent in that dictators took over and not the people they havent had sufficient investment in their education system to knock the social hurdles that western civilization has destroyed thats why we have to guide them through this process and not immediately chastise them as being inhuman they are unfortunately not on the same reasoning level as we are here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats true its otherwise illegal in a few others as well i meant that its the norm among muslims in western countries though like the example from the op article itself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so its basically normalised thats how society should be with regards to being gay unfortunately this is not the case for the most part around the world and lgbtq people are usually marginalised as a result hence i guess forming their own community is a way of gaining support and acceptance which would otherwise be denied to them i hope it will oneday be normalised globally that would be a perfect world to live in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its genuinely fantastic that this is how you view homosexuality and i think that attitude is pretty much the end goal its even more fantastic if that attitude is the norm in canada im gay and while the attitude towards homosexuality has improved tremendously in the us in recent years its been made pretty clear to me that my liking other girls is something that other people care about thats not so say im constantly harassed or anything of course the vast majority of people i interact with on a daytoday basis have no issue with or investment in whom im attracted to i also dont consider myself a member of the lgbtq community before i consider myself an american or even just a woman but when people are being specifically targeted for being gay whether by legislation or by actual violence its hard not to feel a bit like an other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do you say im an atheist im christian when i was talking about christians i was just saying that if you dont believe in the religion then you cant call yourself a member of that religion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also jesus basically ended the practice of stoning women so many people like to shit all over christianity without actually having ever read the bible or having a very limited understanding based on what they heard bill maher say
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just dont think you understand these religions as well as you think i do not mean that in an insulting way and i apologize if it comes off that way that passage is not a call to persecute gays leviticus is a set of laws for jews and jews alone christians do not observe it its preserved in the bible but christians are gentiles and therefor not compelled to observe the jewish law if a jew sees a gay hindu there is nothing he can do furthermore this law was written thousands of years ago the concept of homosexuality didnt exist this is just an offensive but long outdated law that no jew observes or practices today the quran actually does condemn muslims to persecute gays as well as tons of other groups the quran is full of these calls and muslims in the present not three thousand years ago take these calls very seriously did you watch the video i sent you your statement christians and jews are just as homophobia is wrong christianity teaches forgiveness and pacifism jewish law only prohibits jews from gay sex but no jew actually kills people for this read the quran its very clear about homosexuality i know not all muslims are homophobic but most are also you dont understand why christians dont observe the old testament this is telling to me that you are very ignorant regarding abrahamic religions or religion in general edit typo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,data on what european muslims think of freedom of speech a horrifying percentage sympathize with the charlie hebdo massacre so be ityou can despise them all you want about what theyre feeling on particular situationsstill considered as their own freedom to express it but villifying whole group will only adding fuel to the fire there would be large numbers of decent muslimseven exmuslims who would feel the vile treatment by your kind another reason why i pretty much said you and the radicals goes hand in hand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,old testament was given new law by jesus in the new testament it says worthy of death but all sins are viewed that way we are forgiven by the mercy of god
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you realise that your argument is basically that islam is behind several centuries of reform right thats not a positive from any angle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope youre not serious if you research the crusades youll find that almost every single battle was a battle reclaiming areas that had been taken in muslim attacks not all but easily a majority also musliminstigated battles outnumber christianinstigated ones by nearly an order of magnitude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know the crusades were battles for retaking jerusalem right from the muslimswho invaded jerusalem thus starting the crusades
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are kinda correct yes greed was involved but you are ignoring the part where christianity was getting invaded by islam through spain umyadds i think and anatolia seljuksturks in general so while part of it was a pursuit of wealth the other part was a response towards a militant religion invading what used to be christian lands holy land north africa anatolia and iberia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know that the crusades were an effort to retake among other things portions of caliphatecontrolled europe right reaction not action the bible has no instructions on how to slaughter the infidel the bible has no concept of taqiyya and the issuance of heaven tickets to crusaders isnt written doctrine it was a statement by the pope of the day the quran has these instructions and its issuance of heaven tickets is not a matter of situational desperateness but one of plain text in the quran
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very well said agree it may be an uphill battle as it is in many parts of the world unfortunately but its in everyones interest to cooperate and treat each other with dignity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the majority of muslims in uk think homosexuality should be illegal similar numbers in other european countries
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its by no means perfect here either i do know some people that either take issue with what other people do with their lives this along with many other things in my book falls into none of my damn business
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant just be a person with a different perspective can i i have to a member of a degenerative hive mind because that helps keep the anger and hatred thriving all the way to the voting booth in november smh as i stated previously bigoted beliefs in major religions hasnt been and still isnt exclusive to islam the doctrine of the other major religions isnt exactly tolerant and isnt evolved much beyond that of islam its the people that are leading that charge toward tolerance yes modern predominantly christian countries are much more tolerant to lgbt and womans rights try to keep in mind history spans longer than years prior to that how different were they muslims are at a slower but steadily growing pace moving toward more tolerant views something you see the extremists desperately trying to prevent in frequent news reports this is precisely why they kill more muslims than any other sect blaming their whole religion and painting with broad brushes acts as their biggest recruitment tool you are playing right into their hands my friend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not comparable at all the comparison would be muslims not believing in allah but by your logic im going to assume you feed prostitutes to dogs alive since thats something in your holy text or do you reject that part ever had sex for pleasure and not procreation by your logic youre not actually a christian
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i went to mass for years in catholic school and the old testament was quoted and preached rather frequently in bible study i was assigned passages from the old testament almost daily whether old law applies today is disputed sure but if it is present in the bible im not going to discount it and ignoring that this law still certainly applies to jews but please please please dont look at what im saying as a commentary on christianjewish societies today they have come a long way and are obviously very civilized and tolerant – and i have similar hopes for muslim societies you ignored my entire point i thought i explained myself pretty clearly i understand that islam condemns homosexuality and i understand that muslim theocracies are intolerant and persecute gay people today i was not disputing that though you seem to be convinced that i was so im not entirely sure why you keep repeating yourself rather i was disputing the original comment that asserted that all muslims are intolerant in this way which is simply not true he also said that this politician that invited lgbt community members to the meal was doing so solely to boost his image and that all tolerant muslims are faking it people like him and maybe you seem to only focus on the intolerant side of islam im not denying that many or most not sure what the metric is but i dont want you to get pissy over semantics muslim societies today are terribly intolerant and bigoted but seeing all this terribly generalizing antiislam rhetoric and these sorts of accusations really frustrates me when i personally know several gay muslims and prolgbt muslims who dont conform to these views at all and actually hold western values hell there are entire muslim countries again turkey and lebanon come to mind that have come a long way with lgbt rights but people dont point to them they only point to saudi arabia fun fact jordan a muslim kingdom not even a democratic country legalized homosexual acts before the state of texas did for what its worth i upvoted you because i think youre making a few valid points unlike alot of people on this site one thing thats ridiculous though is that you sent me a video of isis killing gay people and described as representative of modern muslims do you really think all muslims today are like members of isis most muslims despise those violent bigoted neanderthals the king of jordan even refuses to acknowledge isis as islamic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the society for human rights in chicago becomes the countrys earliest known gay rights organization the worlds first the transgender organization the national transsexual counseling unit was established in san francisco activists in miami florida pass a civil rights ordinance making sexual orientation discrimination illegal in dade county you know as well as i do thats a disingenuous way to look at the american attitude towards gay people it wasnt until that a good number of states even made it legal to be gay the answer to question is no gay people did not have rights in places where the contingencies were largely christian years ago you can be a pedantic fuck all you like that doesnt change the way things happened your bullshit research amounts to me saying black people have had equal protection under the law in america since america has been accepting of black people and not racist in in the slightest for years fuck you you know thats wrong and so are the ridiculous examples you provided also be less autistic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how about a httpsenwikipediaorgwikitranssexualityiniran for starters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes you are correct this is a ridiculous argument and you are right there is more chance the kinahans hit a random gay lad by accident
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the point was that they are too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not several centuries christianity is in a way still going through these reforms what you do have in the muslim world is the conservative sect of the religion retaliating in a violent way as it tries to keep a position amongst rapid globalization that by its very nature forcesdemands change im not saying that there arent parts of islam that promote radicalism but just like christianity where there are parts that promote violence there are also parts that promote peace and people will pick and choose and interpret however they wish radicalism is far from solely a religious issue that we can dismiss as all muslims want to kill us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reclaim what the holy land was never under the rule of franks englishmen and all those other intruders who came from western europe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reclaiming is highly debatable and even then that doesnt counter my other points nor justify the murdering of women and children pagans not just muslims as for who initiated id like to see data on this i dont have the time right now to do research on this but to the best of my general knowledge it was still the christians who were the initiators both of the crusades themselves and of individual battles unless maybe if youre including battles initiated by muslims to reclaim lands taken by christians within the crusades but that doesnt make sense to include that if reclaiming is being used by you as a justifiable reason for starting a fight for the christians im going to go play videogames now if youd like to continue this intellectually with sources for our claims id be more than happy to continue this through pm at a later date
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wasnt aware that those areas were christian from the start of time pretty sure someone owned that area before them actually several someones what would you say makes them the rightful owners to that area religious historical significance no those lands were claimed by many religious demographic no they werent rhe majorty as for time in ownership dont quote me but i believe they are on the losing end of that too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there was also the crusade to purge their own ranks of undesirables there was also the case of their reclaiming often leading to raping and destroying of the land and cities it wasnt so simple as some glorious attempt to take back the land
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would bet that what you think you have learned about for one taqiya is completely wrong my source i live in saudi arabia and have asked about this and i have looked it up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i would be curious to see the funding and methods behind those polls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of christians in the us said that homosexuality shouldnt be accepted by society in that doesnt mean that those of christians were going around murdering gay people in the comment you originally replied to i stated that its the norm for muslims to live in peace with homosexuals not the norm for muslims to actively accept homosexuality im very well aware of how backwards attitudes towards homosexuality are in some countries and with some religions ive lived in some of those countries as a gay gal it kinda seems like youre trying to find a reason to argue with me because ive said something vaguely positive about muslims in western countries youre obviously entitled to your opinion and im not trying to be catty here but theres not much use in trying to convince me that muslims should be hated if thats the gameplan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so do the majority of texans httpsenwikipediaorgwikilawrencevtexas wasnt until and if it wasnt left to the supreme court it wouldnt have changed they still have that law on the books by the way they just cant enforce it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed the idea of somebodys life being at all affected by strangers being attracted to the same sex has always been a bit mindboggling to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i dont think you understood what i was staying i was saying that the only way you wouldnt have the muslim beliefs that were dangerous is if you werent truly a muslim likewise a christian who doesnt believe in god or jesus is not a christian not that being a christian means you have to follow the bible to a tee its virtually impossible youre also forgetting that christians dont regularly endorse and do violence like feeding prostitutes to dogs while muslims do the simple truth of islam is that its a dangerous religion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if we were talking in person im sure it wouldnt be as confusing i think were missing each others points but i get what youre saying now i think islam warrants more criticism as muslims still chuck gays off of roofs and stone apostates to death but yes there is offensive stuff in the bible as for your gay friends hopefully they are the future of islam tolerant casual muslims who dont go for the jihad thing your heart is in the right place but i am not sure your friends will ever be part of mainstream islam
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah thatd be wonderful were it true however simply cannot compare christianity and islam one to one sure the bible has violent verses but if you applied the same rules to both religions in how to interpret what you read youd come to the same result as what we have now islam says emulate the prophet christianity does too but sadly the two prophets couldnt be more different islam says follow the latter verse if two verses contradict which in the bible is fine but in the koran the more violent verses are at the back of course this is all irrelevant because you cant pick and choose which verses you like or not because the koran is the absolute and indisputable word of god its a simple problem for now dont tolerate intolerance right now that means not bending to people whose values clash with our own even if that means pissing them off and we all know what happens when muslims get offended
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except pick and choosing is exactly what people do thats the point of priests and imams within the koran there are plenty of verses advocating peace and many muslims choose to follow that path instead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,many maybe but not most
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you realize if most were the way you view then we truly would be in all out war and there wouldnt be groups like isis who kill other muslims for not being radical enough right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,here just take a look what muslims all over the world think about certain issues heres an excerpt and link to what mostly western muslims think about key issues of younger muslims in america believe suicide bombings are justified of young muslims in britain believe suicide bombings are justified overall of young muslims in france believe suicide bombings are justified overall of young muslims in germany believe suicide bombings are overall of young muslims in spain believe suicide bombings are overall the poll is from but if you have a more recent one id love to see it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all im seeing from this is that these arent the majority which is in my opinion the real matter at hand since the antiislamic sect is preaching like islam itself is the issue clarification edit was referring to your text not your link as for the link itself it is showing mixed reviews some places do have a majority in favor of radicalism yes this isnt something restricted to muslim radicalism extremists from time to time and place to place have historically become the majority or at least the most influential but other places like turkey showed low support for such views you also have to consider that these people are all going to have different views when it affects them more directly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so will next year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont forget its still we can lose anyone at anytime looks over shoulder
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cute but this is not real news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shut your goddamn mouth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good guy inmates
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love this is in uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,operational support worker francesca sage was the first to arrive but she did not open the cell door fearing it was a staged attack sure well go with that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good fucking god man murdered by convicts due to raping a baby d
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow i wonder how many pairs of contacts they had to take out for it to kill him all those inmates must have pretty bad vision
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well it brightened my shitty day of waiting on flights
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it tells you within a few paragraphs of the article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a dead paedo is the only good paedo so this is definitely uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think youre the one who needs contacts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it says contracts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all it said was burned with sugar mixed with water im not too sure how that works either
UpliftingNews,not_removed,congrats you didnt get the joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kings mother deborah wyatt added that a fellow gang member had been sugared – burned with sugarfilled water – in an attack he feared was intended for him the sugar makes the boiling water stick to the victims skin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh no dude the joke was fucking awful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the last time this happened in the it was to round up all those inherently violent black youths hope that wont be the case this time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for kids in the inner city of manhattan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is the da announcing this did he decide to do this instead of prosecute somebody i do not know all the job responsibilities of a district attorney
UpliftingNews,not_removed,east harlem as of a few years ago had a disproportionately high amount of children in jail and more often then not it is for a misdemeanor or a wrongplacewrongtime situation as a new yorker i really hope this investment goes to help those kidsthey need the support
UpliftingNews,not_removed,only those poor ones on the upper west side without a park view
UpliftingNews,not_removed,don´t be a dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is this uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they make it sound like they are doing them a favour when any company would take on cheaper foreign workers s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,free dones yay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it says according to a recent poll but how recent was it before or after trump came to power
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who the fuck is this tracking the state of idaho
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the majority are still dissatisfied i dont see how this can be considered uplifting people surveyed were slightly less dissatisfied yay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gallup began tracking this issue in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,americans
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but who
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good thing they didnt go vigilante on him and destroy the evidence although tough as shit they kept their composure and probably guaranteed a conviction doing so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fact that it was her best friend is weird what the hell was he planning on saying that she blacked out after one drink maybe act like the hero when some random drugged her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am blown away at just how prevalent slipping something into someones drink seems to be is this something that happens all the time where are people getting the substances to slip in the drinks is there some kind of large underground network of people who are all in on this disgusting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the kind of see something say something that i am totally behind doing math on a plane not so much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really sad that a guy who is considered as a best friend would do this he must be a complete loser if he has to drug women to have sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,had a friend die two years ago because of a date rape drug she was out with her girlfriends enjoying a night of dancing somehow someone put the drug in her drink the police have no idea who though because the guy apparently got cold feet and never made a move she got home safely but died during the night from the drug her mom found her the next morning sleeping in bed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not only do i commend these smart brave women but also the restaurant for handling the situation with grace ladies on behalf of my wife and daughter and women everywhere i salute you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im glad to see people out there watching out for others this really is uplifting whats scary is that it can really happen anywhere by anyone im glad shes safe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a psycho glad these people were able to take care of the situation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,such a sad story i opened the article hoping maybe there was a chance that this is all a misunderstanding and that maybe after an investigation it would show there was nothing in the drink and the woman who saw it had somehow thought she saw him drug the drink and he didnt or something but it looks extremely cut and dry he did this like the da could get sick and appoint me the prosecutor and my dumbass could get him thrown in jail and it was one of her best friends i really hope that the guy gets everything he deserves i hope the woman who was almost drugged doesnt have any kind of psychological troubles after being betrayed by a close friend and i hope these girls who saved her get the heroes thanks they deserve
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe i am old fashioned by why would anyone do such a thing i cannot understand why you would to have sex with a woman who was not interested in you weird and sick and if she is interested you certainly would not need drugs if you are a decent person ick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know this is meant to be uplifting but to me its the opposite it instills a great sadness in me that people we know and trust are capable of doing things like this while i am happy that this girl is still safe thats like saying thanks for not killing me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that guys has done this before you think that level of premeditation just happens fuck rapists more people need to stand up like this again fuck rapists
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a guy friend of mine got roofed or whatever it is called he ordered scotches for the table and his pretty coworker was outside having a smoke and on her phone she comes back and says she hates scotch my buddy says goody more for me and takes her glass half hour later he was a zombie this guy drinks a ton and it was his second drink how do you go about finding this stuff how do you put yourself in a position to thinki may kill this person but at least i can see them naked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and then the whole bar got up and clapped as we walked out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i checked the news article online for this story he is being held on one million dollars bail i am surprised his bail is that high but glad to see it is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that sleaze well done to the girls who played it absolutely correctly scumballs like that get the good guys tarred with the same brush
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what doesnt make sense to me is that they are on a date so she obviously likes him this means if he just acts normal and nice to her shed probably eventually sleep with him willingly so it just boggles my mind why he would try to drug her it must be some power trip or just something wrong with him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how long did she know him if he was playing a long game hes only going to get craftier unless he does for this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what chargespenalties is he facing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,only one and it was the person they were with shocking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was out with a girl i know had just gotten to know over the past weeks we go out for drinks and we run into a guy she seems to know well and he buys us both drinks not too long later i have to head home because im not feeling well and she stays back with her friend i fell into bed and slept about she woke up at his house the next day and didnt remember a thing we were both drugged and she may have been rapedshe didnt go to the hospital
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is nobody going to mention how long it took for the police to get there they had a call that a guy had attempted to drug a woman he was still present and the evidence was intact yet she had to sit through an entire dinner before they showed up hell the restaurant even had to fake the computer being down to delay giving him the check thats ridiculous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,doesnt everyone see the comments by chris stating the story is fake
UpliftingNews,not_removed,saw this on facebook before reddit and for some reason that makes me think it isnt true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,before the women left the restaurant several patrons came by to commend them for taking action saying that similar incidents had happened topeople they knew or themselves i doubt that only of women that file police reports for rape are found to have date rape drugs in their system on a related note i wonder when were going to see a news story about an average woman making a false rape allegation that isnt a retraction of an earlier news story no time soon im guessing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what i want to know is what the fuck are people drugging girls with i would understand if it was an ultrapowerful benzo like flunitrazepam roofies or phenazepam or something that would work but every time i hear a story about someone drugging a woman the description makes it sound like its ghb as someone with a lot of experience with ghb i dont understand how this stuff can be used to drug someone the dose youd need to slip into someones drink to make them black out is really really high a little bit might loosen someone up but it wouldnt necessarily make them do anything they didnt already have at least some albeit inhibited preconceived idea of doing the dose youd need to give someone to black them out on ghb would be noticeable as fuck it tastes strongly of sodium or potassium ive even shared ghb consensually of course with some fairly light women and they didnt get more than tipsy off a small dose maybe if you were putting it in a tall glass of coke it would work but a glass of wine i dont get it does anyone have any statistics on what drugs people have been prosecuted for spiking peoples drinks with im genuinely curious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man people like this need to be killed i hope i get the chance one day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the article was kind of weird i half expected it to end up being an engagement ring he put in her glass
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also bouncer see guy hold up his gf who is clearly to drunk so i walk up and grab her arm to show the night is over for her and he just lets go and walk of some bf i think but when i try to talk to her i notice she is really out of it muscles all limp non responcive noticing that im basicly carrying this girl down the stairs some of her schoolmates show up and ask if she is ok i tell them she cant go with them and that im calling the police to pick her up when i ad that they can tell her boyfriend this they let me know she is single and has only been in town a week no wonder the little creep slith of when i walked up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats awesome swallowed drugs instead of his pride
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im hoping the reality of this story is that he passed out in the bar and you roughed him up tossed him down the stairs and threw him in the trash i choose to believe this version
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i imagine you saying not in my bar as you tossed him by the belt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in reality this is a terrible thing drugging someones drink is serial killer level behaviour if you see someone drugging another person that person should be arrested and convicted that drink is key evidence there are a million crimes for which there are no evidence drugging a drink is one for which there is clear cut bullet proof evidence throwing that evidence away and letting a rapist go is pretty shameful that is if this story is even true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did he leave right away after drinking it were any charges pressed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how do you buddhist know all this stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was truly the best possible outcome nobody got hurt perpetrator was caught in the act with tons of evidence which is usually rare in these cases
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is a very good takeaway here and a good lesson on rational behavior over emotional behavior they easily could have gotten themselves in trouble or made it harder or impossible to lock this guy up had they acted on their rightful anger in an irresponsible way instead i think its safe to say his ass is gonna do some good time these women did the absolute best thing possible they prevented a rape and did the best they could to get his ass thrown away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that she blacked out after one drink it was two beers with lunch and a bowl afterwards but thats the gist of what i heard afterwards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well it was vials of clear liquid so it was probably ghb or alcohol either way since her car was at his place id say his plan was to get her so intoxicated that she had to stay with him and then she would feel responsible for whatever happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he could have easily convinced her that she was having too many beersglasses and they both got wasted and had sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we fell into bed together in a fit of passion it was amazing everything was perfect we were both a little drunk so i dont remember everything either thats probably normal i was a little startled when you said you wanted to start dating last night but you know i think youre right we fit together so well dont you think
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminds me of that reddit post a woman made about how she found a hidden camera in her bathroom that her roommate and good friend for years had hidden there it really pisses me off not only the acts they committed but the fact that they could betray a friends trust even after years of friendship how could any woman ever trust anyone after reading stories like these do you just have to be constantly on guard around everyone for the rest of your fucking life or what
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the courage it takes a woman to say yes is beyond anything i can imagine a woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill advised the whole species existence counts on them doing it and i dont know how how do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men were the number threat to women globally and historically were the number cause of injury and mayhem to women were the worst thing that ever happens to them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think louie does say a similar sort of thing in one of his specials he talks about the courage required by both sexes to go on a date men must overcome their fear of rejection whereas women must overcome their fear of death
UpliftingNews,not_removed,me and a friend were drugged at a bar once by three guys one of them had had a onesided crush on my friend for quite a while the second was someone we both knew and the third is the grandson of my grandmothers best friend and the son of a friend of the family i still to this day stay updated on where he lives not because i seek him out but because our lives are so entwined even though were not friends and they fucking dare drug us both
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think louis ck got that from an hbo surveydocumentary httpwwwhbocomdocumentarieswhenstrangersclick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like theyve been friends a while who is to say this was the first time it ever happened after the initial shock and sadness at my best friend attempting to drug me with what everyone assumes is the intention of making rape easier i would be irate and stop at nothing to see that he is punished as harshly as the law allows i cant imagine the trust issues this girl is going to have after this experience
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while i understand why that primal fear exists its not actually rooted in reality men are drastically more likely to be murderers than women but also drastically more likely to be murder victims we mainly kill each other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unfortunately these drugs are really easy to come by they are widely used in the chemical industry and you can buy them by the gallon at a very low price its hard to restrict trade with these substances because they are just so common
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are these people called drug dealers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the most common substance in such cases gbl is used as a detergent legal in many countries and pretty easy to get its also cheap a liter can be bought for around in a chemical store sometimes its even sold as graffiticleaner in normal hardware stores and you only need a few milliliters to put someone in a coma dangerous stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not prevalent at all only of women that file police reports for rape are found to have date rape drugs in their system on a related note i wonder when were going to see a news story about an average woman making a false rape allegation that isnt a retraction of an earlier news story no time soon im guessing it happens all of the time during custody and divorce proceedings when it does the police dont give a shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats wrong with doing math on a plane
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think loser goes far enough the proper term is sociopath
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really sad that a guy who is considered as a best friend would do this he must be a complete loser if he has to drug women to have sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think calling men complete losers because theyre not having sex is one of the factors that leads to this in the first place of course the guy was completely in the wrong but there are a lot of things we can do as a society to prevent these things from happening
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah he should pay for sex directly or indirectly like the rest of us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is too horrible for words im sorry that happened to her and to you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read it as the woman who said that hadnt yet witnessed the actual drugging but something about his body language seemed off so she started paying attention
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is worse than attempted assault lmao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they were featured on nbc news this evening they did the right thing and deserve only honors for their actions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people rarely consider themselves to be the evil force of their own narrative there is probably a long and extremely convoluted justification train he has in his mind about it for instance he may have himself convinced that she truly does want to have sex with him but society forces her to be chaste or something so all she needs is a little loosening up he may even be able to pervert the concept to the point that he feels like hes helping her do what she really wants to do without the guilt ive never been a rapist so im completely grasping at straws here in fact i have never made the first move on a girl in my life because im terrified she wouldnt be completely into it so im way outside my realm but this is the only reasonong that even remotely makes sense to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a skindeep interest in screwing a person combined with a massive sense of entitlement and viewing women as possessions to be claimed seems a good starting point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im guessing he wanted more from her than just being friends but she didnt he drugs her takes advantage of her at his apartment and convinces her she wanted it the whole thing is a blur to her bc of the drug and she is left wondering if she was sexually assaulted or if she was into it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think its about the sex as much as it is about power im sure getting a hooker is easier than obtaining these drugs and finding a way to put them into someones drink im not a criminologist but ive read a little bit about it and a lot of these people just get off on the fact that they have complete power over someone else they can decide to have sex with them and then it happens no matter what i think it would even be plausible for them to lose interest if the other person actually consents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had a friend who was about when i found out that he tried to have sex with one of our mutual friends while she was unconscious drunk in his house at a party in his bedroom wed been having parties at his house for years prior to this with no incident the sad thing is we were not surprised at all when we found out that he did he was a massive ego maniac who used to say he was a god and a gift to women and always talked about fucking chicks in the ass the man didnt actually have sex for the first time until his late from another mutual friend out of petty because the dude was creepy as shit when it came to women
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while i appreciate your sentiment i need to mention that this has nothing to do with being oldfashioned rape has been around since the dawn of time and date rape drugs while not always as sophisticated as they are now are nothing new it stems from a deep lack of empathy when concerning women borne out of the narrative that womens needs and desires are less important than mens tale as old as time heavy sigh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know you are right that is fucking sick i dont know if this phenomena is getting worse or what but i had barely ever heard of this as anything outside of murder mysteries on tv or in the movies until the roofie thing happened in the early its just beyond disgusting bill cosby is the poster child for this depraved behavior and now young men are emulating him i just dont get it is there a generation of sociopaths in our midst
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it must be some power trip or just something wrong with him i think that hits the nail on the head its not about getting laid in a consensual way its about having power over another human and taking what they want
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they were friends women are more than sexual objects just because a woman enjoys spending time with a man doesnt mean she will eventually sleep with him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was wondering if this might be fake its almost too perfectly told kind of reminds me of the uva rape story can you elaborate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the police took him no need to go to trial of public opinion this time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he will get his punishment in due time a lynch mob is not necessary for justice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they name a perp in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it looks like we have a hero in our midst
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because its a news story based off fb post
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is totally anecdotal and probably useless as i have no clue what drug it was but i didnt black out my vision started greying out and i tried to walk away from the second floor bar the last things i remember were a mild sense of panic that i wasnt sure exactly what my feet were doing and going downstairs felt like a terrible idea somebody turned out to be my best friend grabbing my arm and pointing me at an escalator puking in a trash can at the bottom a minute or so later and then sitting against a wall some time mins an hour after that having both puked again and eaten an entire cheeseburger i did not remember
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like poison
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a fantasy about that theyd be bartenders and id order a boiler maker then theyd ask me how ive been and id say been better hoping theyd make small talk and not knowing how to start but instead i get a half sympathetic smile and give them a dollar tip id spend five minutes drinking at the bar watching the other patrons but careful not to meet their eyes another three at the jukebox then grab my jacket and call it an early night because i have work in the morning and i dont know anyone there on the walk home id stop at the red box outside cvs and leaf through the catalog but leave empty handed because i have work in the morning and ive already seen everything worth watching and most of the rest besides arriving simultaneously at the apartment complex gate is one of the bartenders and i hold the gate for her and give her half a nod which she half returns i eat crackers in bed and make sure my alarm clock is set
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you mightve saved her life or atleast saved her from being raped
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why would you call the cops on someone practically unconscious wouldnt an ambulance be better whats a cop supposed to do with someone that might have alcohol poisoning edit cops will take you to jail they arent a free taxi
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id say he still lost his pride anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i believe what hes saying is the guy was caught drugging womens drinks and was ever so gently escorted out of the bar and accidentally fell down the steps and landed in the trashpile but according to the police report he tested the drink himself and wackiness ensued
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats what he meant when he said they had no problem with the story edit grammar fix
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the reality of the story is that he drank the drink hastily left to get home before it kicked in slept it off then went back to drugging chicks the next weekend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fell down some stairs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,woosh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,doy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that would be fucked up actually what if it was a lie the whole trust but verify seems to be adequate here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youd think its serial killer level but its really not people do this shit way more than youd think its fucking depressing also dude said that he drank the drink meaning the drugs are in his system testing him would prove possession and intent on top of whatever else he had on him and at least op can testify him putting it in the drink dude didnt get away with anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did he leave right away after drinking it are you registered as legally blind so i spent some quality time explaining to police how a guy accidentally drugged himself fell down some stairs into they alley somehow and landed in a pile of trash you really ought to be if you didnt even see that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rnothingeverhappens
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also shows remarkable composure by the intended victim to be able to get through the dinner without tipping him off i dont know if i wouldve been able to do that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sociopaths might be as common as one in this guy may have been one probably not the only one in the bar that night actually
UpliftingNews,not_removed,random just turned on the tv and it was on charging him for attempted rape million dollar bail still no chemical test though youd think that would be a quick test with an indicator strip of some sort
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive taken ghb you dont just think you just got wasted haha either way what a dick whats the crime from attempted drugging assault be impossible to prove intent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know the obvious implication of dropping roofies in someones drink and for any reason its reprehensible but why attempted rape he didnt try anything sexual as far as i have read why not attempted murder kidnapping battery like wĥy rape specifically
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who the hell would fall for that if youre blackout drunk you may not realize you were drugged but if she was sober i highly doubt she wouldnt be suspicious guy must be delusional since you are probably close to his line of thinking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you editing right now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,killed for laughing at them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hrm ive never been killed but i have been laughed at being laughed ats pretty bad it hurts my feelings how bad can being killed really be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,men are afraid that women will ruin their lives women are afraid that men will take their lives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most guys arent this way you dont hear the endless stories of good things that guys do but everyone hears of the bad ones its like people being afraid to fly in a plane because theyre afraid it might crash when its extremely unlikely that you will ever know anyone that gets in a plane crash we just hear only about the ones that crash we dont hear about the millions of planes that land safely every day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is that a gender thing though it could be reversed there is literally nothing about that that is specific to women as victims edit downvote and attack my person instead of actually discussing this issue only makes any rational person more likely to believe that you dont have any valid arguments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes i remember and then he added for men its heart disease thats our biggest threat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be fair though rejection is much more likely than death
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah because men are prehistoric murder machines a lb woman can kill a man by pulling the trigger of a pistol just as easily as anyone else if you use common sense you shouldnt have to worry too much about being murdered while going on a date statistically theres a much higher probability of being killed in a car accident while driving on your way to a date but hey you have an agenda to push so dont let a silly little thing like empirical data stop you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres some sort of fallacy going on here while thats true its also true that when women are murdered its almost always at the hands of men
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what are these drugs i have only heard of rophenol and thats a prescription drug as far as i know you make it sound like this is some sort of chemical like ether or something doesnt seem to me that you could put some random chemical in someones drink without seriously altering the taste
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats that from i recognize it so strongly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rretiredgif
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it means youre a terrorist if you are italian and have curly hair httpwwwcnetcomnewsacademicquestionedbyamericanairlinesoffcialsfordoingmathonplane
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its pretty much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a math professor was doing math on a plane a passenger sitting near him saw that and reported him to the authorities because clearly those were secret terrorist symbols happened just a couple weeks ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some times you just need
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some idiots think it is an indicator of terrorist activities
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes i got scolded for calling him a loser
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really sad that a guy who is considered as a best friend would do this he must be a complete loser if he has to drug women to have sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no hes a loser because he drugs women and tries to rape them as a society i think theres a lot we can do to prevent that from happening but most of those ideas involve rotating knives still poor men youre so right that they are the real victims here s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no youre a loser if you feel the only way you can get sex is by raping your friends while unconscious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uhhhh no just no i understand society pressures men to be sexually successful but you still have to be a sick motherfucker to drug and rape someone let alone your best friend you cannot blame societal pressure for that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unless youre buying it from somebody who uses selling it as a means of employment sex is not some kind of currency to be exchanged no amount of moneytimeeffort invested in a relationship entitles you to physical gratification
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lmao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in fact i have never made the first move on a girl in my life because im terrified she wouldnt be completely into it this is actually a huge problem in our society a lot of guys are so afraid of being labeled creepy that we never develop the confidence to ask women out unless were sure theyre interested first unfortunately as a general rule lack of confidence is a huge turnoff for women and can in fact cause them to lose interest this leads directly to the nice guy issue — guys who have gone out of their way to try to do things right often become increasingly resentful and misogynistic believing in redpill bullshit instead of figuring out that the proper way to attract a girlfriend is to make yourself the best you can be and meet as many women as possible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rapists and people who commit sex crimes do indeed often justify it in their own head and try to make it seem not as bad she wanted it etc nervous about making a move when you feel like the moment is right just ask can i kiss you worst case she will say no and youll save yourself the embarrassment of kissing her ear on accident when she turns her head at an unanticipated incomingkiss if shes into you shell think its super cute and polite that you asked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive never been a rapist so im completely grasping at straws here in fact i have never made the first move on a girl in my life because im terrified she wouldnt be completely into it so im way outside my realm but this is the only reasonong that even remotely makes sense to me i am so totally this guy myselfmy fear may be indefensible but its real although the second worst thing a women ever did to me was because i didnt want sex with her so there is that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know its sort of weird to ask anybody to sympathize with a potential rapist but thats a really biased and totally unfair starting point uaawillma made a comment that i think is worth reading below
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bill cosby is the poster child that was happening back when quaaludes were super prominent it was happening a lot back in ye olden days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i see i thought they where on a date
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ghb will make you dizzy and give you a sort of warmachey feeling in your spine it makes you feel less inhibited but its also harder to converse effectively its really a lot like the feeling of alcohol but a little more overbearing at the high dose more usefully it only effects you for around three hours and the peak where you might actually not remember much is under an hour sound accurate to you i just figured people would notice it because at the dose needed to achieve those sorts of effects your drink would taste incredibly salty sodium is the counterion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,safely get them home presumably we have more police force than necessary ambulance meanwhile might save lives lets not use one unless really necessary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they will take her home or to the drunk tank by the time i started surpecting druging they were already on their way they come time a night and even though druging might have been a risk to her health she was breading and had a pulse so maybe not call an ambulanse just yet when they might have more urgent things to deal with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id estimate he lost it right before the fall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he did say that he drank the drugged drink i think the fall came after though i hardly have a problem with that he knew exactly what he was doing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its what we call unrealiable narrator adds a layer of ironic perspective to the proceedings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like the idea that he roughed him up and threw him down the stairs though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,poor trash panda
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if it were a lie he wouldnt have passed out from the drug
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but its really not no it really is it doesnt matter in the slightest how often it happens in the context of how terrible it is it is an action that needs to be caught and punished people do this shit way more than youd think i would also say that we hear rumours of this type of thing all the time but there are very few arrests in some cases the drugging doesnt even happen but people get drunker than they expected or sick for some other reason and then believe they were drugged for all of these reasons it is absolutely imperative that every single time this story comes up it is coupled with an actual arrest and actual evidence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow didnt realize i was going to have to deal with an overreacting psychopath today just because the cops are talked to doesnt mean the guy was cuffed just because he drank the drink doesnt mean it hit him as soon as it touched his lips
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very true not just having the balls to face him but the composure if i was out with another dude who i considered was a good buddy of mine for beers and i found out he drugged my drink i would probably want use his head to split a bar stool in half i dont know what she would have wanted to do but have the composure to face him was definitely not one of them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not just sociopaths who drug their dates all it takes is a twisted sense of reality and a couple of consecutive bad decisions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im curious what would it feel like to be drugged with ghb if you had never tried it before
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems like attempted kidnapping would apply and if i remember right ghb is a major charge
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ask a judge idk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the saddest part is this guy probably isnt delusional its more likely that he made a bet that either shed believe it and go along with him or feel enough pressure that shed at least not tell anyone else and in many cases he would have been right sometimes after being attacked a rape victimsurvivor goes into a deep sense of denial how could this have happened this cant be real there must be an explanation but i was so careful in some cases it takes time to even use the rword to describe what happened and if its someone they really trusted they might even go along with it despite sensing or even knowing that its not true because society has so deeply trained us to be confrontationaverse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not the killed part that sucks its the whole killing process that leads up to it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where was that written
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and this would fall under undercut their world view aint nothing in that paragraph that could reasonably elicit that response
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably more to this story than you let on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree with you most guys arent this way but this is the comment that inevitably gets made whenever a story comes up about a man acting in a harmful way and while true derails the conversation about sexual violence misogyny and womens issues in general im not trying to be a dick about this at all i just want to point out that women know its not all men and the discussion is not about the men who arent the problem there is a fraction of men who are the problem and the most supportive thing that men can do is to not get defensive but rather to listen and understand our experiences and work to make a world without sexual violence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats because landing safely is what planes are supposed to do you stupid fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do you feel the need to say this does every comment about these situations really need a not all men women can be abusive disclaimer why the insecurity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont be intellectually dishonest how often do women get this done to them by men versus the reverse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you just accuse a standup comic of ignoring empirical data
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how frequently do women get murdered on first dates what is the percentage of all dates that result in a murder youd literally be better off worrying about being struck by lightning
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes its a common chemical and it does alter the taste but sometimes people dont draw the right conclusions especially if theyre already drunk they may just drink up and order something else next because that drink was really bad there was a case in my city where someone was offering free shots and claimed that he had just become a father so naturally people were celebrating with him and accepting the offer many people reported that it tasted off but they still drank it there were several people who had to be hospitalized
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the princess bride
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the princess bride
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i do not think that means what you think it means
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my dinner with princess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt even have to click the link to know inconceivable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the princess bride
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no both the drinks in the movie were poisoned the hero just built immunity to it beforehand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh fer fucks sake
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep more often than not its the people you know best who hurt you the most this guys probably always had a crush on the girl but never managed to ask her out and was left in a friend role while he watched her date other men always hoping that hed be the next its honestly scary how many guys fall into this usually it doesnt end with them resorting to drugs but regardless its never a healthy relationship for either party if youre attracted to a girl ask her out dont stalk her pretending to be a friend youll save yourself a lot of heartache and if youre a girl be careful not to string guys along if you think a guys only your friend because he wants to date you and you dont want to date him make it clear to him in order to avoid situations like this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we have a lot of sociopaths among us if we can keep even a small number of them from doing anything too horrible by not calling them losers we should take that chance doesnt make them any less responsible for their own actions its just a matter of not poking the bear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so a mans worth and whether or not they should be considered a loser is completely entirely based upon their sexual prowess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not the cause but it may be the trigger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think hes trying to explain that the creepy part comes from the friend who can only see the body movement and such its another woman who notices the vial
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the person who said creepy didnt see the vial reread the story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ayyysault
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah thats actually excellent advice a lot of my encounters have come from sheepishly admitting that i want to kiss her or something ive also been told my body language makes it super obvious im into her so i guess i should have said i can make the first move verbally but not physically not with my wife though she kissed me while i was in the middle of a sentence about something totally different hasnt been listening to a thing i say since which is smart i tend to drone on and on about useless shit funnily enough when i dated men i could make the first move no problem im still unsure why it was so easy to do so compared to my experiences with women possibly because society allows women to make unrestricted moves on men because all men want it or if it was just easy for me because i wasnt afraid of rejection from a man because i wasnt really that into it no idea that goes much deeper into my inner lesbian psyche than ive bothered to go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im lucky that im also a girl so my lack of initiation hasnt affected my sex life or love life too much if i was a guy id probably still be a virgin since men are expected to make the first move i dont know how dudes do it honestly they are expected to make the first move but never on a girl that isnt into it but if they ask first its weird or ruins the mood
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know how dudes do it honestly they are expected to make the first move but never on a girl that isnt into it maybe you all will think i am oldfashion i am but here is my advice you just have to be gentlemanly and considerate and personable the first step is be courteous and considerate to the all gals you meet except for the glamorpuss typesstay away from gals above your station especially the bigego ones to the rest be friendly and courteous even ones you think they are not attractive once you get to know her you will probably change your mind if you are naturally nice to everyone the gal community will realize that you are a nice person by courteous i mean just saying hello and smile do not say hello and smile or try to flirt with gals above your stationthey will think you are a creep and tell everyone else you are a creep so dont bother if she is interested she will say hi and smile back if she does not then ok dont bother her again chances are she will at least give you a perfunctory acknowledgement over the course of days or weeks yes weeks you can expand your conversations with the gals that were friendly eventually you will get a feel for who is interested and who is not at this point you can make the bold move and invite her to lunch not dinner or drinks or a party but something safe like lunch where she can get to know you if that goes well then you can do a real date i could go on and on if anyone is interested
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im aware of the logic twisters they use to justify themselves and not be the bad guy its all windowdressing on the root of my wants are supreme and to me you are just a way to satisfy them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that makes sense i forgot about those
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought they were using the word date as a social outing not as a romantic one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in my city at least if you call the cops on someone thats passed out drunk they are going to jail not home id rather have someone wake up in a hospital bed than a jail cell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cops arent a fucking free taxi if you get picked up by cops your ass is going to jail
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,context
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah youre right i missed the passed out in the bar and and read it as im hoping the reality of this story is that you roughed him up tossed him down the stairs and threw him in the trash i choose to believe this version sorry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wtf ok never said that they shouldnt be punished just said that they werent at the same frequency as serial killers of which there are a few dozen active in the us the number is obviously so much larger that the comparison is selling the drugging problem short and besides the whole narrative of theyre like serial killers just ignores how almost all rapists are considered to be good people by most around them can you say the same for the ted bundys of the world and most rapes arent prosecuted and even those are likely to not be wins this is a problem with rape in general not drugging also conveniently ignoring the main point much also dude said that he drank the drink meaning the drugs are in his system testing him would prove possession and intent on top of whatever else he had on him and at least op can testify him putting it in the drink dude didnt get away with anything its funny that youre jumping down my throat about all of this when my point was that youre selling the whole situation short its worse than you made it look and that you were wrong the op did get the guy prosecuted which was the right result i was very clear about all of this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow sorry to make another reply but i wanted you to see this sorry for being a douche about the correction i wasnt so clear i suppose this is just very personal for me and i thought that you were saying that i was somehow being complicit when i thought that i was pointing out that it was actually an even bigger problem which hurt and i lashed out im sorry for that i needed a bit of distance to see things more clearly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no it really is it doesnt matter in the slightest how often it happens in the context of how terrible it is it is an action that needs to be caught and punished indeed i attended a work bash and agreed to be a designated driver for several people this meant i was the only one drinking a girly drink orange juice which was targeted by some wannabe rapist asshole as my passengers were plastered i had no idea that some asshat had drugged my drink i drove several people home without realising i was under the influence i have no idea how i managed it luckily i didnt crash we only realised the next morning as i had passed out on the floor and had a raging hangover despite not drinking any alcohol fuck people who drug others drinks if i had crashed and caused any injuries perhaps the police might have investigated more thoroughly than they did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,overreacting psychopath says you ese not sure quote how my confusion as to your reading comprehension qualifies me for psychopathy but ho hum when op described the fact that he roughed up the punk and chucked him in a dumpster that sort of tells you that a he knew the guy was spiking the drink because thats why he punished him with a beating which tells you that b said punk obviously stuck around long enough for the matériel to take effect on his system so op could realise it was indeed matériel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but it does require a lack of empathy i realize thats not limited to sociopaths though im not really sure what a twisted sense of reality means
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive tried it if you just do a little its actually quite fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah the more i think about it the less keen i am on being killed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its the sadness youll leave behind or worse the knowledge you wont leave any
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where did anyone say that natural capacity had shit to do with this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean id put it differently but yeah yeah i guess thats whats happening there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no where
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my mother in law probably has it written somwhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,might have been from a speech she had not sure though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope as someone who has been in an abusive relationship i can confirm that the first thing an abuser does is put you in this paranoid headspace that ends up causing you to burn your bridges with the people actually trying to help your abuser wants you alone with no friends to turn to so that you wont leave them for fear of social isolation an abuser will tell you that your friends are jealous trying to break you up trying to manipulate you an abuser projects their own abuse and tries to make you think its your friends doing it you already feel uneasy uncomfortable and used and now the person you think you love is telling you who to blame so you blame your friends you lose your friends and leaving your abuser is that much harder its what they want i almost lost my foster brother who has stuck by me through years of my bullshit when i was bedridden from disability he would help me use the toilet but i still let my abuser convince me that my foster brother hated me and thats why he was always short with me in reality my foster brother was short with me because he was frustrated thar i was still dating an abuser id be short with him because he was short with me and we both grew tense around each other the whole time my abuser made me think it was because i was unwanted in my friendship group
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow this is beautifully cogent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and not raping women are what men are supposed to do im guessing the connection went over your head
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because with more awareness of the danger of being a woman some stereotypes around men start to form they dont want to be profiled as a potential rapist or murderer which most people arent but the few who are tend to be male
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how could any woman ever trust anyone after reading stories like these do you just have to be constantly on guard around everyone for the rest of your fucking life or what i think its because of this his point maybe being that while women may have to be on guard against these specific things being on guard in general would be necessary for both sexes as bad things happen to both sexes it doesnt mean that no one should trust anyone and it is kind of alarmist and hysterical to think isolated cases of anything justify a panic room situation a similar response would be for westerners to never trust a muslim and be anxious and scared around all of them because of terrorism notallmuslims
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because mra logic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is no insecrutiy just logical scrutiny i havent heard of anyone being filmed in the bathroom male or female and any a priori assumptions are just that assumptions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when was the last time you saw huge media coverage or social media coverage for a male victim in a similar scenario exactly whenever i see something about a man being beaten i see women cackling about he deserved it or girl power nonsense its not insecurity its a legitimate very real issue with society
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah its true that these kinds of things happen more to women the people who bring up the reversal aspect want to prevent men from being stereotyped as always committing the act
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not particularly defending or attacking anyone but is this a question to which we know the answer because in topics like this assumptions are dangerous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have literally never heard of anyone being filmed in the bathroom but whats the point of discussing in this sub if u just get downvoted for going against the grain so closed minded edit no need to use fallacies such as ad hominem by calling me dishonest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont jump to conclusions without doing the research speaking of intellectual dishonesty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont need to date to get murdered and men can be killed by men too or by women a knife is as sharp when wielded by a woman as when wielded by a man so men also have to be constantly on guard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,deleted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while thats true its impossible to tell if the prevalence is so low because we worry over it and remain hypervigilant to the possibility
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god damnit i hate dirty fuckholes like that guy for making me distrust everybody
UpliftingNews,not_removed,inconceivable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just wanted to be a cool kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,an old nice guy best friend of mine tried to rape me when i was and passed out drunk at a mutual friends house being betrayed by a best friend especially in that way sucks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and if youre a girl be careful not to string guys along if you think a guys only your friend because he wants to date you and you dont want to date him make it clear to him in order to avoid situations like this this is good advice all the way around lgbt folks can use it to not just straight eights
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in this thread zero people have said its okay to call people losers for not having sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not having sex does not make you a loser drugging women to rape then because you are not having sex does i think you and the chap i replied to may have a small issue with reading comprehension or does saying that count as poking the bear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,way to defend attempted rape through what amounts to a semantic argument you need to get your priorities straight
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no youre a loser if you feel the only way you can get sex is by raping your friends while unconscious nowhere did i say what you wrote its funny that so many of your dudes are not getting this a person worth is based on their actions if you are a man and you feel the only way you can get sex or even self worth is by action of raping a woman that you are in fact a loser
UpliftingNews,not_removed,possibly because society allows women to make unrestricted moves on men because all men want it or if it was just easy for me because i wasnt afraid of rejection from a man because i wasnt really that into it as a guy who experimented all the way around i can say it is probably a bit of both of these issues flirting with gay friends is still lots of fun for me once we have established im straight edit works the same way for my lesbian friends unless they are into my lady at least im not narrow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeahi did ask this women if she was interested in sex once after the whole why dont guys just ask if they want to have sex with a women line got dropped and she was all im not emotionally over my last relationship yet line in response so i said and that is why guys dont try that more often we stayed friends over the summer until she realized that i really was only really interested in being friends and then she just disappeared my real issue is that i just dont have the level of drive to get laid so many men seem to have masturbating is as relieving as sex with someone i dont love so i just stick with that when im not in love most of my relationships last in the years range though so i feel pretty lucky in that regard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe you all will think i am oldfashion i am but here is my advice you just have to be gentlemanly and considerate and personable this has always worked for me in so many ways in life if it becomes a habit to be polite as a baseline you will quickly get a reputation as a quality person do not say hello and smile or try to flirt with gals above your stationthey will think you are a creep and tell everyone else you are a creep so dont bother i am polite as a baseline to everyone you never know when that nice old lady that owns the jewelry store with her husband has a granddaughter waiting tables you would be just perfect for and really unless you are in the military or dealing with a power tripping authority figure someones station really shouldnt matter in how you treat them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats the point of them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i meant as a romantic event
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in the uk youd only end up in gaol if you were being a cunt about it the police are more likely to give you a lift home or at least to a taxi rank but then again ive been caught absolutely hammered with a stolen bottle of vodka and smoking a joint stumbling home and all they did was chat to make sure i was okay just a vastly different culture by stolen i mean the girl who brought it never came to the afterparty so it was up for grabs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,considering the price difference id rather wake up in the drunk tank than to a couple thousand in medical bills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,serves that trash panda right for being such a cunt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,speaking of serial killers many drugged their victims like dahmer and bundy dahmer had a year old boy escape him once drugged and naked the police officers simply returned him to dahmer assuming domestic trouble and that you were wrong the op did get the guy prosecuted nowhere in ugunchs story did he say the guy was prosecuted if you want to preserve evidence and actually charge someone you dont make him swallow the evidence just because it will make you feel good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think the point they are trying to make is that this behavior shows a complete lack of empathy or concern for another human being to advance ones own desires its a defining trait of narcissism and sociopathy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh my god please just go away i forgot you existed and it was bliss
UpliftingNews,not_removed,see those crazy incel subreddits do you think many of those fuckers are above drugging women hell just saw from one about how sluts need to be murdered because literally rape isnt enough these arent sociopaths sociopaths tend to not feel fear so they wouldnt have any of the problems that these douchebags blame their fucked up world view and failures on people are fucking crazy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wrote twisted sense of reality to account for those who are capable of empathy but have somehow convinced themselves that drugging another human being without their consent is the right thing to do ie someone who has convinced himself if i drug her take her home and she wakes up in the morning safe in bed with breakfast waiting shell see that im a really great person and that they can trust me or i know im the right person for him if hed only give me a chance i just need to lower his inhibitions for a night so that he lets loose a little and sees that im fun to be around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry that wasnt clear im asking you to explain what the high would be like to a first timer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,typical reddit judging something before trying it themselves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the truth shouldnt be silenced
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in other words no one said that and youre pulling up a strawman from the depths of not sure though emotional abuse is never okay towards anyone of whatever sex or gender full stop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im confused are you insinuating that abused his ex kinda messed up brah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cheers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,says the guy who saw a story about a rape being prevented and took it personally and a trump supporter to boot oh you must be just another misunderstood nice guy pathetic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes painting men in broad strokes and then men getting upset is mra logic pound sand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how many women have you heard of getting filmed in a bathroom honestly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre in the us you can look up the us dept of justices httpwwwbjsgov and the for stats on crime according to what ive read in those places men and women experience statistically equivalent rates of violent victimization men much more likely to be victims of homicide than women and women much more likely to be victims of sexual assault but men are the overwhelming majority of perpetrators of violent and sexual crimes towards both groups you can follow links in the citations of httpsenwikipediaorgwikisexdifferencesincrimeintheunitedstates wikipedia article for some tables is also a good report
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because the status quo in this sub is that women are always victims
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously there was just a story on the front page about this yesterday someone found a guys cellphone recording people on the toilet just off the top of my head in addition to that one i can think of two stories where this happened at a restaurant bathroom one at an eye clinic bathroom one in a girls locker room bathroom and one at some business i cant remember what kind it was it happens all the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wasnt making a statement i was paraphrasing a standup comic who made a joke its clearly a triggering joke for certain types though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not true at all source am blase about thunderstorms still havent won the lottery
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i dont know what thats from you win
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its used to describe the type of guy who laments being friend zoned by women because theyre too nice they think that guys who do get girls are assholes and they are owed sex because they were nice to a woman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like i should expand on reddit and some other places online its used sorta tongue in cheek my previous description is not trying to say that all guys who are nice believe this just this particular type of guy that is actually not nice but always says that they are check out rniceguys to see some examples
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and zero people have claimed that anyone in this thread said that its about society in general
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not having sex does not make you a loser its great that you say that but unfortunately not everyone agrees with you its not at all about justifying rape and murder its a pragmatic approach to a huge problem heres a thought experiment imagine you could prevent someone from murdering a child by giving them yes that would be the end of it no catch would it be fair to give them the money most certainly not but would you still do it i really hope so ultimately preventing the murder is more important than dealing out justice its really the same here if we create a society where people dont have to feel like a loser for being a virgin some sociopaths might just stick to torturing flies and ants its not that we want to do something good for them but if we can find a way to prevent some of them from doing horrible things to other people we should do it even if it has nothing to do with justice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did i say that theyre dangerous either way but we can still try not to trigger them worst case it doesnt help and we still have as many cases of rape and murder as before but now regular people who dont have sex dont feel like losers anymore so what is there to lose its a pragmatic approach not a moral one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so regardless of whether i have the desire to do it or whether i actually do it im a loser if im not a macho sex addict i mean fuck youre comparing me to a rapist because im unattractive and not good with women you cannot seriously think its okay to call me equal to a rapist because of my lack of social skills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,got me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah only times a policeman has stopped me while drunk was to make sure i was okay getting home and offer me a ride theyve always need polite about it also upvote for the spelling of gaol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they dont inform witnesses of the outcome but an obviously drugged person that can be tested is obviously going to be tested and will likely be found with other drug paraphernalia associated like whatever he used to carry the drugs healthy skepticism is fine but these are totally legitimate assumptions that stem directly from what the op described speaking of serial killers many drugged their victims like dahmer and bundy dahmer had a year old boy escape him once drugged and naked the police officers simply returned him to dahmer assuming domestic trouble i dont understand the relevance of this it doesnt have anything to do with what i was talking about or what you were talking about its kind of a random tangent this is what i wrote just said that they werent at the same frequency as serial killers of which there are a few dozen active in the us the number is obviously so much larger that the comparison is selling the drugging problem short the methods of serial killers have nothing to do with their frequency and comparing drugging and raping people which is much more common is downplaying the problem also the whole narrative of theyre like serial killers just ignores how almost all rapists are considered to be good people by most around them this goes for after they have been accused not many serial killer supporters that arent insane the people supporting their best friend or thinking that polanski is totally cool are not the same as manson family supporters you cant claim that people are downplaying a phenomenon that you are downplaying yourself with these comparisons i was and am really trying to be as nice as possible but seriously this is totally unproductive you misinterpreted my comment from the start to say the opposite of what i said and havent let it go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure i got that its also not that uncommon though we think of those people as being a small percentage of the population whereas the group that would do this is even larger than that so its not the clinical narcissists or sociopaths doing it its a much larger group of people who apparently show empathy elsewhere but can rationalize doing this shit to other people weve gotta recognize that to avoid minimizing the problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fortyfivetopkeks if you dont wish to learn to improve your reading ability that is perfectly fine by me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if not sociopathy some mental illness or personality disorder that accounts for it i think lack of empathy is big among all the cluster personality disorders youre right though this kind of violence is bound to come from a point of hurt pride not necessarily lack of feeling
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just dont see how a person with empathy can get there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well your body feels super drunk but your mind isnt quite as wasted it still has its sharp moments as compared to being super drunk where everything is just a mess much more aware of your sorry state noticeable difference to me anyway i feel like i would know i was being drugged for sure especially if i was sober granted im a big guy and took a little cap a full dose on a girl may be a completely different experience could hit you so fast you dont stand a chance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im often told im very closeminded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well im a guy so not a lesbian but my legs are pretty hairy thinking of shaving em though so i can run faster when i chase down my one sworn enemy the cis white male
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nuhuh u are one oen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no im saying it sounds like s ex had an abusive friend who when tried to help his ex she claimed was insecure and left him uferfrendongles said theres more to the story but i feel like the story makes perfect sense tried to help but the ex took the abusive friends side leaving the ex alone with the abuser because was forced to leave due to a delusion the ex held possibly because the abusive friend put that delusion there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wooooooow have fun with that attitude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trump supporter now youre reaching cause you made an idiot of yourself by throwing a temper tantrum like a little school boy grow and and do some reading
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a man nobody said anything about all men nor really any men except one specific one who did something disgusting then some guy comes in getting offended hurr durr this could happen to men too sure its possible but irrelevant if you really took that as an insult against all men youre probably looking for a reason to get offended
UpliftingNews,not_removed,personally none ive never heard of a case of anyone getting filmed in the bathroom but i do know that in cases of sexual harassment women are more frequently the victims
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont have any statistics off the top of my head but a manager at a local bar just got arrested last year for installing hidden cameras in the stalls of the ladies room
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id like to point out a discrepancy in how these crime statistics are used i think most would agree that your statsciting is a valid argument but had someone cited the same stats for race they likely would have been labelled a racist and make no mistake the bjs has something to say about race for example see page of it is my opinion that either both statistical arguments are valid or neither are you cant accept one without also accepting the other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wasnt the whole thing like most men that are raped wont come forward with it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dunno ive never heard of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you realize partially as bad is the same thing as not as bad right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they think that guys who do get girls are assholes thats true and they are owed sex because they were nice to a woman this is not its a cop out to blame type of behavior on nice guys though they believe this shit because they were lied to by the women who raised them and their female friends about the traits women want in a sexual partner
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you feel like raping women than i can seriously think that i didnt have sex until i was in a long term relationship and well into my twenties and i never felt like raping a women
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ask me how i know youre not african american
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i will never surrender to the americanisation of our language even though theres no real reason to care it satisfies the petty side of me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure its likely that some of those folks have a disorder which obviously doesnt excuse their actions but might explain them but we shouldnt discount the reality of the situation which is that most rapists are going to be or at least look to everyone as if they were completely normal thats all i think people want to make clear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ohh my bad i get it now i was placing the abuse on the wrong person in the story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which is not what were discussing my point was that men could be filmed equally as easily as women and can prove that girls are filmed more so its ciruclar logic and perpetuates the image of women as victims in instances where they arent which is not good for equality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think both should be accepted and used in a constructive manner people should be using such stats to ask why and trying to solve the problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for the doj they tried to mitigate that through confidential surveys of people vs just arrest records and tried to factor underreporting into their estimates but its true sexual assault statistics are very difficult to quantify most women who are sexually assaulted dont come forward with it either
UpliftingNews,not_removed,guess things youve never heard of never happen then do a google search on restroom voyeurism two way mirrors in bathrooms with cameras on the other side or a camera in a ceiling tile seem like pretty popular methods woman discovers camera in work bathroom man charged posted literally hours ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you seriously not see the difference in your version the one who makes the sacrifice becomes the victim instead in your version the crime still happens despite the sacrifice if someone decides to willingly have sex with someone in order to prevent someone else from being raped its in no way a free decision and thus its still rape in my version the sacrifice is minor and not personal spending wont cause anyone trauma this is equivalent to the original issue treating longtime virgins with more respect may cost a little effort but it wont hurt you completely turned around my thought experiment going back to the original your version is equivalent to the third person sacrificing themself and being murdered in order to prevent the murder on the child thats just a completely different issue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wouldnt ever consider raping a woman or well anything so stop equating me to a rapist because i dont have sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because ive already said im british not american p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we in canada salute you although it may be too late for many of us we also feel this pettiness in our hearts and raise our fists in vain against the rising tide of americanisms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people who are sociopaths and narcissists often spend a lot of effort looking normal too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn you got me guess ill go tell my girlfriend that its time to stop being forever alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my fear was being rude my abuser always had an excuse for his behaviour and i didnt want to be rude and break up with him over things that werent his fault months in and i realised it didnt matter if it was his fault or not what mattered was that i wasnt being hurt the break up revealed his true colours and i was able to recognise that his excuses were excuses and he was knowingly abusing me i can see where your coming from in the strictest definition staying with an abuser is a type of weakness but i think its important to acknowledge that all humans have weakness being weak and being in an abusive relationship doesnt make you less strong than other people its just that your weakness chose to effect you in this way leaving an abuser requires a lot of strength compared to what strength youve displayed previously the only way to harness that strength is to gain some self confidence and focusing on what makes you weak is an obstacle to that a lot of the therapy involved in recovering from abusive relationships centres around focusing on yourself as not weak its hard for someone who has escaped abuse to hear people call the abused weak no matter how true it may or may not be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you just destroyed your argument with that line at first you were trying to say men and women can be equally victimized now you say that no one is victimized
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah fair enough i know nothing of the subject just things ive heard here and there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre equating yourself with being a rapist i was never talking about you i was taking about a man who would feel they should or can rape an unconscious woman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure its also an incredibly small section of the population mental illness alone doesnt even come close to explaining the amount of sexual violence that happens this is exactly the narrative that helps people excuse people that they know who are totally great people and would never hurt anyone and deny that they actually raped someone the point is to break with that narrative because it so clearly doesnt reflect reality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but how can we know if you change important details of your story was it fear of isolation or fear of being rude i dont think you can be upset with people misunderstanding you when there doesnt seem to be much certainty to begin with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not at all im simply trying to explain there is no difference
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i should have specified a bit more that its another person who has decided to have sex with the wouldbe rapist to prevent rape i read your comment again and edited my response my point still stands trust me women care far less about if youve already had sex than men do so thats not really the underlying problem yes it is what does it matter if these people are mocked by men or women its a fact that being a virgin after a certain age is a stigma even if people have the decency not to outright mock you which still happens they at least make assumptions about you that youre somehow incapable of having social interactions immature or if they dont know you personally that youre fat andor ugly the truth is that there are a lot of reasons why people remain virgins for a long time asexuality is a thing some are closeted homosexuals who have no interest in women but havent figured out how to deal with their interest in men yet especially when theyre in a homophobic environment some want to wait for the perfect one in the end its nobody elses business why someone is still a virgin and we shouldnt make assumptions about people based on this at the same time female virgins also have to deal with stigmatization theyre often seen as prude boring or again probably ugly

UpliftingNews,not_removed,years ago washington post published a story chronic fatigue syndrome more technically known as myalgic encephalomyelitis is a very common disease affecting around million american and million people worldwide it is also one of the most disabling diseases leaving those afflicted bedridden and sometimes even tubefed however almost nothing is known about his illness and government funding is basically nonexistent but that didnt stop ronald w davis biochemist and geneticist at stanford who in his talk he revealed the amazing innovative work hes doing with his team we had developed a device and it is a nanofabricated device its basically like a computer chip it has a small channel in it that we can put about a tenth of a drop of blood in and that is all we need for this assay it has electrodes in it and each electrode is sampled times a second so it generates a massive amount of data now this is very cheap and it is a realtime assay were also looking to maybe even increase the throughput on this instrument so that we can do massive drug screening we have another device that we developed that is called magnetic levitation it separates out cells based on their magnetic properties that is being used currently to count tumor cells in cancer patients and also their profile we have some signatures that weve seen in this device also from mecfs patients and were trying to combine both of these technologies so the magnetic levitation is a little device that fits onto an iphone it is very simple it costs us around cents per assay we have another new technology that uses an inkjet printer to make the devices all of this work is completely funded by private donations if you want to donate for end mecfs project that open medicine foundation is spearheading this is the direct link

UpliftingNews,not_removed,no but then im a space travel enthusiast so this kind of thing appeals to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats very impressive im glad he will be rewarded euros i think that law is a pretty cool idea im sure he didnt do it for that reason but im glad he will get a little windfall of it and hopefully some positive publicity as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he actually found he gave back as thankyou for letting him stay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well its not enough to live on forever and with this hes become undeportable this was the smartest decision he could have made for his own safety

UpliftingNews,not_removed,waives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because its only a problem when trump does it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably because when someone who comes off as a racist with a prejudice agenda makes a ban based on someones religion it comes off as racist obama never had made radical allegations never made up factual information never lied and discredited the press the list goes on and on

UpliftingNews,not_removed,what did he stab her with cupids arrow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really cool story glad something so negative turned into a positive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,after the attack in dohme hill flatlined four times she lost so much blood that she went into a coma and suffered a stroke that left her paralyzed many of her facial nerves were severed and she was left unable to speak or smile cameron hill was one of the first responders who found her and put her in a helicopter to the trauma center a year later the two met at a luncheon they started dating two months after that he proposed in at a baseball game and the two were married this month in front of many of the first responders and doctors whod helped dohme hill survive her attack

UpliftingNews,not_removed,its selfish really he told wfaa when people smile i feel better it lightens my world this is the kind of selfishness everybody should follow all the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how does the credit card company allow a tip on a cents bill i thought you were limited to how big of a tip you can leave in proportion to the size of the bill any one know if this tip would actually get processed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i gotta agree with the guy in this article when i do something nice for someone else its honestly for selfish reasons i just like the warm feeling i get when someone thanks me for doing something nice and the smile that blossoms on their face
UpliftingNews,not_removed,got some annoying popup from the site fyi

UpliftingNews,not_removed,super legitimately uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive never heard of a restaurant charging for water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a texas man didnt realize how much his kind gesture meant until the recipients family paid him back for it literally kasey simmons a server at applebees never misses an opportunity to try to improve someone elses mood its selfish really he told wfaa when people smile i feel better it lightens my world while at the grocery store on aug simmons noticed a fellow shopper who appeared to be unhappy given his generous nature he walked up to her and offered to pay for her things i insisted simmons said it was only but its not about the money its about showing someone you care the next day while he was working a shift at applebees a small party sat down at one of his tables ordered a flavored water and asked for the check simmons had no idea what was coming next they ordered the cheapest thing on the menu of flavored water it was he said but my tip was about percent the woman who had ordered the water left simmons a tip on a napkin she wrote a short note explaining that the woman simmons approached at the grocery store the day before was her mother who had been lamenting the third anniversary of her husbands death on one of the most depressing days of the year you made my mothers day wonderful she wrote according to the idaho statesman she has been smiling since you did what you did you are one of a kind she added have fun with this you made her year simmons is grateful to the woman and said he would like to meet her and her mother to thank them in person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,me too what a bullshit site
UpliftingNews,not_removed,could be a debit card
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is an old machine where you still have to sign the receipt and the server closes the tab on the pin machine manually the credit card company doesnt know how much the original bill was as it is closed out and sent to the credit card company as the full amount ergo it does not send up any red flags as the original amount was only a preauth similar to if you were to rent a car they put a hold of a certain amount on your card for a deposit but never take the money actually off your card until they close your bill at the end with whatever amount you were actually charged for and the funds that were preauthorised are released
UpliftingNews,not_removed,flavored water
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have you considered a career over at rsavedyouaclick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes but i use the reddit app which opens web pages in full blown aids mode
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that would make sense thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh thats a nice sub
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah i see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it isnt obvious to me what the caps are for the patients are selecting which option to play next by looking at it wouldnt eye tracking be easier it looks like the for different options have lights flashing at different frequencies so the caps are picking up the flashing activity in the visual cortex it would be interesting to give them more options for creativity by composing music with more advanced and open ended interfaces then having them played back later rather than live
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is so much negative in the comments live performance and collaboration is a different experience from composing these people are cut off from the whole world just look at these peoples faces and i am sure these are just few first steps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so those paralyzed arent delivering a performance exactly instead they use multiple choice to dictate predefined patterns this is a case where the use case sounds great on paper or in conversation but ends up being dissapointingly misleading yes i am a scientist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also what exactly are they choosing not the specific notes it seems but just options for the next measure or two measures it sounds lovely but honestly selecting between measures that have already been composed is something my cat can do i think its a gross misrepresentation to say these musicians are delivering a performance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok its great it makes people happy but dont you think its a little misleading a brainwave is a force measurable thus conceivably the acting agent for the sound event that would be dope a paralyzed musician could continue playing and being creative every day thats what we want what we got was this big production that is is fun for an hour or so and then the hospital ran out of money an eyetracker with an xy axis would be more fun this and any musician knows it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree its odd how they skewed it so much probably to get a grant or something from what i do understand though there is a neuronal structure in the auditory cortex that generates sound on its own like when you have a song stuck in your head or if you are just reading music absolute music this area is firing and active im not a scientist but if that were true and you could capture and represent these as a wave function you could do some really amazing things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,psa gmos are usually a good thing have a nice day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why would this possibly be uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,better access to information is always a net positive but gmos are safe necessary being antigmo is sort of akin to being an antivaxxer or denying climate change best to side with science
UpliftingNews,not_removed,totally misleading story consumers will need a smart phone to read the ingredients if gmo but non gmo has the option to say so with words more spin set up my monsanto why is a former monsanto vice president running the fda michael r taylor was was promoted to commissioner of the fda after spending years lobbying for the gmo foods giant the position affords taylor the ability to sign off of any cancercausing harmful agent produced by monsanto httpinvestmentwatchblogcomwhyisaformermonsantovicepresidentrunningthefdamichaelrtaylorwaswaspromotedtocommissionerofthefdaafterspendingyearslobbyingforthegmofoodsgiantthepositionaffordstaylo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this isnt a good thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually this law makes it so you will have even less clue whether gmos are in your food or not it replaces states laws that required printing on the package whether or not ge food was in it with simply sticking a bar code or url on the packages food lobby wins again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know if this is uplifting but i dont really see it as a bad thing either
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant wait for people to start requesting restaurant food absent of gmos
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a labeling bill it doesnt limit the availability of gmos i for one would like know what food is gmo and what food is organic so i can buy the gmo instead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so because they are safe that means people shouldnt know what theyre consuming brilliant logic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thus law actually takes away information kills better state laws this was a food lobby victory this post in no way belongs in uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its unfortunate that most scientific studies are funded by special interest groups who lobby for a specific outcome for every pro gmo article ive always found contradicting articles that list the negative aspects of gmos there really never was a long term study on the issue and with bayer wanting to buy monsanto i can see a conflict of interest there id prefer to know what is in my food and if given the option id prefer to eat foods im safe and comfortable with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,soon calorie free restaurant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre mistaking old cigarette commercials that supposedly featured doctors with science there was never a consensus of scientists saying tobacco was safe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres no need for the speech marks around safe they are actually safe and gm isnt a thing you consume its a process
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you say you have found articles both for and against gmos but you dont mention the authorship of said articles or whether or not they have been peer reviewed for instance the world health organization has said that there are no negative health side effects to gmos where as the majority of the antigmo articles are at best written by journalists with no scientific training or popular bloggers there is a world of difference between those the sources used
UpliftingNews,not_removed,monsanto is a thoroughly disgusting company and i think a lot of the flak that gmos take from the left have to do with their unfortunate association with monsanto gmos can and should be considered outside of the framework of monsanto there is certainly a lot of money and lobbying against gmo labeling but there are far more independent studies that prove gmos safety very very few actual real scientific statistically significant peerreviewed show adverse effects of gmos of any kind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,contradicting articles that list the negative aspects of gmos paid for by the organic industry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id prefer to know what is in my food and if given the option id prefer to eat foods im safe and comfortable with enjoy starving
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive always found contradicting articles that list the negative aspects of gmos and i can find articles explaining why climatechange isnt manmade how the moonlandings were a hoax and how the world is flat dont mistake an article with a peerreviewed study of which none exist showing harm from gm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you taste flavored air
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the gmo monsanto industry lobbies far more pays alot more than the organic industry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is your point that we should never ever trust scientists on anything because theyve been occasionally wrong in the past
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the difference being that the biotech industry has science on its side where as the organic industry relies on pseudoscience to boost their market share
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no the biotech industry in todays corporate society looks for the outcome which will generate them the most profit if gmos caused cancer or other disease but yielded more product or more income to the pharmaceutical biotech industries they will go in that direction we live in a treat and care society not a preventive one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,again youre working on the false premise that there was at one time a consensus of scientists saying tobacco use was safe that never happened httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgcmzjjjuxqi
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre not that new theres already a scientific consensus in their favor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so youre saying that scientists are never wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont come off as someone whod read something and change your mind based on it httprationalwikiorgwikisciencewaswrongbefore from the beginning ive known exactly what youre trying to argue and its not a valid argument
UpliftingNews,not_removed,should include ddt and asbestos with cigs when it comes to scientific consensus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like youre confusing common myths with scientific consensus also it really sounds like youre saying that we should never trust scientists with anything ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im saying its stupid to oppose the scientific consensus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does science oppose labels
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was being nice and trying to walk you through the flaw in your reasoning i would be surprised if you actually read the link i provided and took it to heart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre convinced that youre right see after a couple of comments from you i knew even with a link to a great explanation for why the science was wrong before gambit isnt a valid argument youd still stick to that in internet forums the commenting isnt always for the person theyre commenting to its for others reading the conversation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those damn onion cutting ninjas manright in the feels
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is this uplifting sorry but this just makes me dislike little kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,popping my collar now in preparation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant wait to try something from the last decade d
UpliftingNews,not_removed,omfg i just came
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i remember when this hit the stores and begging my mom to buy it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youll all want to have this song ready when you buy your first bottle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wtf anybody would drink something with a big saturn logo on it is beyond me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this stuff is so horrible for your body why is this in uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,closer to years ago i think they stopped selling it in or
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rule if this isnt something you like thats cool but no reason to be a jerk about it to those people who do this made me really happy to revisit something i had fond memories of from my childhood
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because i love it and it made me very happy to hear it is coming back you dont have to drink it if you dont want to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for correcting me i heard it ended in like but i didnt know it ended in the early
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a health issue pushing poison is not uplifting its rather the opposite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pushing poison ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mr mcconaughhey please turn left here cahnt do it broh all right all right all right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why does the big girl always ride in the back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope this thread makes the front page just so everyone knows what a treasure this comment is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,best thing about ut students i keep gettin older they stay the same age
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sorry to bring a bitter taste to otherwise great news but isnt employment in these surat based diamond businesses based on family networks if thats the case then i wonder how many of these beneficiaries not close relatives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre not direwolves but its still a great story anyhow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the president also told the governor to secure a job for me or my husband njoki said the president also promised to pay her nieces university fees that would be corruption also why is this uplifting because they get stuff this piece is not mentioning the thousands of other villages the president didnt visit that day this kind of randomness is precisely what is keeping subsahara africa back or am i missing something here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,take note the president went there to check the electrification project that has brought electricity to this people who never had one in the cause of inspecting the project he met this poor family this is big time uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was actually in kenya last week i went to a town called chwele to help build houses and water towers with a small group absolutely no one there likes their president one man houses about orphans due to the election in he allows corruption and is just as corrupt im not sure why theres a random article attempting to praise him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fucking shill
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the wont stop until we have interbrand fast food mmmm mc whopper double stack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i had a new kind of birth certificate for each two genders nah just kidding great that people can get this now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,makes sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she should stay in there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great to raise awareness but up the ante go or hours
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as usual with the economist i think their ideology trumps facts here the article claims that western economies are near full employment this is untrue the british unemployment rate is double what it was in the continental rates are even worse its claim that people can have as many children as they want is highly misleading the state and the liberal economy have made it very difficult to have more than children max most couples need a doubleincome to stay afloat again trashing the economists complacent view of rising prosperity which means recourse to very expensive childcare and health and safety regulation re childrens bulky car seats means that nowadays you can only fit two children in the back of a car legally meaning that any larger families are either housebound or dependent on often nonexistent public transport finally the idea that collectivism inevitably results in waste and inefficiency is out of date automated factories will not slack off work and much of the century inefficiency was down to weak monitoring of demand this is much less a problem in the digital age the real problem is private ownership of the automated means of production which means the rich are having to share ever less of their wealthpower with the poor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just recently wrote a paper based on utopia it gets more into the philosophical side of what a utopia would look like but sir thomas more did a good job of depicting it for his time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a land where people can operate in accordance with their own wishes unhindered by law is great why not take care of all human lives as well larger dna reserve more people willing to attempt interstellar travel we have information we still need things to create new ways of looking at it those things at the moment are humans
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can kiss all that goodbye now that the morons let trump get elected good work nonvoters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great comment the economist is a well written and respectable magazine however they are and love to spread out an idyllic world view that justifies current social injustice particularly on the middle class it is time for a new ideology to arise that integrates mental and spiritual fulfilment to the economist century theories
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well you think mainstream economics is bunk anyway so anything the economist says being based in economics must be colored by ideology this was you a while ago and for fairness sake i included the part about you having a background in econ too as for what all economists think i couldnt give a flying fuck about whichever lies theyre peddling at the moment economics is a pseudoscience that is almost exclusively deployed to construct a narrative that allows rich men to despoil the natural world and screw the poor while paying themselves as much as possible and intellectually capturing the credulous i have more respect for the verdicts of astrologers ps i have four years worth of economics under my belt including at postgraduate level and the fact that our biggest problems according to you now are childcare payments and small cars instead of you know child labor or no vaccinations also speaks to how cynical you are lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what world do you live in where parents of three are dependent on buses and subways have you forgotten about the minivan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rupliftingnews aka fake news true the optimist delusion let me quote some hobbes sir of the passions that most frequently are the causes of crime one is vainglory or a foolish overrating of their own worth as if difference of worth were an effect of their wit or riches or bloud or some other naturall quality not depending on the will of those that have the soveraign authority from whence proceedeth a presumtion that the punishments ordained by the lawes and extended generally to all subjects ought not to be inflicted upon them with the same rigour they are inflicted on the poore obscure and simple men comprehended under the name of vulgar therefore it happeneth commonly that such as value themselves by the greatnesse of their wealth adventure on crimes upon hope of escaping punishment by corrupting publique justice or obtaining pardon by mony or other rewards note the obvious irony in the above statement since the soveraign is not subject thus unaccountable to the same lawes some of the greatest ironies of our modern commonwealth can be found in that book leviathan by thomas hobbes edit i was looking for another quote actually about the duty of the soveraign to ensure equality equity in the commonwealth since inequality leads to warre as per the lawes of nature its only one of several tenets of the commonwealth that the ruling classes have simply discarded due to private interests which hobbes also warns about although the article itself does make a case on both behalves it contains many pseudohalftruths and fails to see the irony in our modern democratic system
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont really know where to start with this im sorry if you wasted time and money studying this social science you may as well have studied phrenology or apantomancy you should ask for a refund and i can only assume that you were in a coma from onwards and thus failed to notice that economists and financial experts somehow missed the fact that the economic system they had built and endorsed was disintegrating destroying the prosperity of millions of people whose incomes have flatlined in the years since while the perpetrators of the snakeoil financial products that caused the disaster continue to pay themselves huge amounts in recognition of their own talent because the markets never wrong right and i guess you also missed the doddfrank act which was so impressed by the performance of professional economists that it required all references to sp fitch and moodys to be stripped out of us legislation so pathetically wrong had their economic audits proven as for child labour and disease the west has stumbled on a really effective way of eliminating theseit just eliminates children the birth rate in countries like germany japan and italy is subpanda in fact we could eliminate all childhood mortality and hardship simply by preventing people having any kids at all this would be tremendous for the economy adults would be more productive if they werent distracted by their children and they would have to fill the emotional holes in their lives with increased consumer spending which would be great for growth the gdp stats would be great almost right up until the final extinction of our species more realistically economics will deliver this extinction by poisoning the planet in the pursuit of sustainable growth a concept that it only takes seconds thought to realise is both moronic and oxymoronic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you should hang out on rbadeconomics sometime they uh really appreciate alternative viewpoints and i have a job unrelated to economics thanks for the concern i can defend other real things like climate change or gravity without actually working in those fields too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not crying youre crying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what an amazing feeling it must be when a parent realizes theyve done well and done well early

UpliftingNews,not_removed,reluctant hero uugggghhh fine i guess ill go save these fuckin people from this fuckin burning building goddamnit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this reminds me of one of my favorite moments in literature in the fall by camus the narrator recounts a story of how he once helped a blind old man cross the street after ushering the blind man safely to the other side of the road the narrator doffs his hat and gives a slight bow to him but the man was blind so to whom was he really directing this little show of refinement this gesture ultimately belied the narrators true motivations he helped the blind man across the road not for the blind mans sake but in order to garner esteem from the other passersby while a good deed is always preferable to a bad one or to no action at all motivation is essential to understanding the true nature of the deed the individual in this article seems clearly to be motivated by nothing more than good will and a desire to help others but one can see just how unusual we as a society consider this behavior to be his disinterest in praise for saving those peoples lives is in essence a refusal to doff his hat to the blind man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dearman wandered away shortly after the firefighters and police arrived to handle the situation mcissac has spoken to the fire department about a commendation and they are prepared to put in a submission for one — something griffithgreene says she heard about through her landlord as well — but dearman has been unwilling to talk to them about it so far just as he didnt want to talk to the press all i want is he says in the video if im in the same situation for someone to do the same for me one down to earth guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it so hard for the city to give him a job instead the medal hes going to be forced to pawn this facile gratitude pisses me off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that guy is a true hero this made me tear up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a saying about being n hero i am not sure about how it goes but i think it says something around the lines of a true hero does the right thing because its right not because he wants recognition from it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,none of the people he helped offer to help him back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is that the drug dealer from high maintenance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hover hand is strong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thought it said meg griffin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hancock probably
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its fun to argue about altruism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there goes my hero
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think a good discussion on most existential ideas is usually pretty fun im not sure if youre meaning to be sarcastic though i certainly didnt want to give the impression that i dont think true altruism exists on the contrary i think it most certainly does and the individual from the article is a good example of it in action
UpliftingNews,not_removed,watch him as he goes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i disagree but dislike arguing on the internet and i was being sincere i guess i mostly argue against true altruism to fuck withentertain someone who just called me out on being selfserving
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is very sweet but i cant imagine the child was very entertained at a tennis match

UpliftingNews,not_removed,should we blame the government or blame society or should we blame the images on tv no blame canada blame canada with all their beady little eyes and flappin heads so full of lies blame canada blame canada
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have found it interesting that the people offended by clinton calling half of trump supporters a basket of deplorables are fine saying that immigrants are criminals and rapists
UpliftingNews,not_removed,poster what a surprise its not just have to stay away from threads about muslims for the most part

UpliftingNews,not_removed,is there an organization that does this provides fundsvolunteers to build a wheelchair costume that i can contact i live in california and it would be so cool for my little brother whos disabled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if magic wheelchair can partner with httpwwwgktworg they work with make a wish in orlando for all the theme parks like disney how incredible for kids who have to be in wheelchairs to have something awesome like this to use while visiting the theme parks and then to be able to take it home with them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not identical but similar enough— i saw a kid in a stroller yesterday gussied up as a cabbage patch kids box thatd work too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i heard gary busey built this thing for him then smelling of wild turkey and pall malls disappeared into the night singing songs of pissing on various professional baseball teams
UpliftingNews,not_removed,friends ladies neighbors gentlemen if youre feeling underpowered ill help you make amends few things in life are guaranteed but i promise this wont suck pack a punch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wasnt looking to hurt anyones feelings she wants to participate and thats nice we have this sport here at the local hockey rink where the kids sit in sleds and attempt to play a version of hockey its really hard to watch because its really a huge clusterfuck its unfortunate that circumstances made them unable to walk or stand but why try to make it worse by creating a debacle of a game so bad its embarrassing accept that youre different and embrace it

UpliftingNews,not_removed,love that one kid riding a charizard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,today at school there was a kid in a motorized wheelchair dressed as mario i didnt even get the mario kart reference until i was well past him though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah very true ive only hitched once but it was never through a city so that makes sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how do they get up the stairs to knock on the door
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not crying youre crying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you little sweetie god bless you and like any kid you look ornery as hell typical boy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do wheelchair people get the urge to be normal you are in a wheelchair you cant even get up the steps to get the candy at each house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and the lack of money seriously how can they afford this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now i want to see a starship heart of gold one

UpliftingNews,not_removed,god in heaven let you live a short life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what do you mean deal with the city what was he helping you guys to avoid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wholeheartedly agree it is also inspirational for kids who have less obvious disabilities my child has a learning difference and can still very much relate to hiccup i love this series
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im just spitballing but im thinking both parents were genetic carriers for this disorder and just continued to go at it i dont know how expensive getting tested for that stuff is but it may be cheaper than having children with significant disabilities not really sure if im upholding the dont be a dick rule
UpliftingNews,not_removed,glad im not the only one who was upset by that you cant play the lottery with kids lives like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,blood bag on the front of a car
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and built by volunteers so presumably all of that money is going into construction materials etc because otherwise its going to the owners of the foundation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the titanic was my favorite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oregan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oregano
UpliftingNews,not_removed,got the reference
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some of them dont
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thought the same thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do douchenozzles get the urge to comment you are a cum gargling fuckwit you cant even comment without looking like a cunt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they raise money through donations for the shipping and the materials and get volunteers to do the actual construction it is actually a really good idea for a charity in its natural fundraising and volunteer models you can get high school teams to do the building for local kids in wheelchairs and they can likely collect a lot of the donations themselves the national organization that tries to spread it can likely be funded by just a few extremely wealthy donors that have disabled children charities like this tend to be successful because they can almost always find a couple of whales meaning extremely wealthy and invested donors who can fund the entire project indefinitely and who will sometimes make an endowment so the organization always has money a lot of the major charities that are based around a disability of some kind were created in this manner a wealthy parent had a child with the disability and then wanted to help all kids with the same disability i know a family who had a child who had a rare heart defect that didnt present itself until he was and had his life saved by a friend of his doing cpr after that the family founded a charity that focused on teaching people cpr and used their son as an example of why it is important
UpliftingNews,not_removed,costing between and each a team of volunteers spend about hours building the costumes which range from aeroplanes to dragons later on it said even students at a local university wanted to help hell my university did a similar to provide poorer children with an automatic wheelchair reconstructed from driveable ones youd find at toysrus people are good sometimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i used a wheelchair to trickatreat cosplay as stephen hawking but people called me a fucking dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the article said people donate money and theyve e constructed mostly by volunteers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right ive made a couple costumes for my daughters wheelchair that turned out pretty cool but looked like a preschool craft project compared to that and i still spent over on them and a lot of hours the cheapest was the mystery machine the most expensive was galadriels swan boat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre going to be a cripple its better to be a rich cripple tyrion lannister
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most of it looks like plywood or cardboard i dont know where they get the time though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,arts and crafts and some cosplay and costumes can be quite cheap if youre creative and imaginative
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right i dont see how couple sells insanely expensive costumes to disabled kids counts as uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats what im thinking seems like only the most fortunate disabled can afford something like this i cant even buy a nice storm trooper costume because its over a thousand dollars but if you finish reading the article they opened a non profit organization edit sorry if i offended people not my intention my point was that these look really expensive and if i cant buy something like that for myself how are people that are disabled going to but i had also read the entire article and know that they are a non profit charity and assumed the above comment didnt read that part and thought the disabled were buying the costumes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,an episode was aired a few days ago on filthyfranktvs channel definitely deserves an encore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont the null troopers all wear phase arc armor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its just not great to hitchhike through any big city people are mostly going short distances and less likely to pick folks up also some of pdxs offon ramps are nearly impossible to hitch from without putting yourself and drivers in danger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it definitely is cheaper the average cost of raising a healthy child til is raising a child let alone with disabilities is gonna cost some major dough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre saying the kids would be better off never being born at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,blood bag inside a mannequin on the front of a car loaded with weapons gotta go for that authenticity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i suspect that the proper sentence might have been costing between and if you were to buy one these are instead built by a team of volunteers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,article mentioned he started a nonprofit charity and funds are raised through donations
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he tied his best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oregun hyuck hyuck stupidity never ends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,heres a video about their charity an how it started
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as someone who spends a bit of time around this sort of stuff id argue efforts could best be spent elsewhere obviously helping a direct friend family member is different but if your just doing this to make yourself feel good not a great way to do things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im referring to out of pocket expense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know its trickortreat yeah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you have the voice modulator or were you just going around in a wheelchair telling people you were hawking theres a fine line between emulation and parody
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats because people these days are a bunch of uppity boo hoo bastards just looking for things to get offended at and then have a furious social media circle jerk about on a completely unrelated note your username has me triggered so hard my haemorrhoids burst and will have me crying myself to sleep on my facebook like button pillow tonight you son of a bitch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah might have been the fact that you didnt actually need the wheel chair unless you did cause if you did need the wheel chair they just needed to get their panties out of a bunch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,article explains that theyre now a non profit and the funds to make them are raised through donations volunteers give their time to build
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpwalkinrollinorg id imagine itd be more like this link is to an american charity since last time i checked volunteers were unpaid and worked for charities interns are unpaid and work for businesses the couple probably pay for the costumes through donations heres the link httpwwwmagicwheelchairorgdonate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i also will never understand how when they had one kid with a rare genetic disease they then go and have four more with three total having the severe disability so they knew when their first son was months old but still had more children its pretty disgusting and selfish in my books ive known since i was in my teens i would not live to because of the genetic condition i was born with if my parents had kept making kids knowing they were carrying this painful awfulness i dunno if i could ever forgive them they had no way to know with my twin sis and i
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think that the disabled kids buy them they send in a video of themselves to the non profit organization about what they want to be and why they deserve it i think that if theyre lucky they get chosen to receive one the cost is just how much it costs to make with supplies and labor but they are a non profit now and probably rely on donations and volunteers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but thats spread out over all years plus any assistance and tax breaks middle to lower class families may recieve
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes actually i am just like id abort a child if i discovered early enough in the pregnancy they were going to be born with some crippling disorder i dont think life is necessarily sacred and i believe that no life is less of a net negative than one lived disadvantaged and suffering
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ahh that makes far more sense it seems so weirdly suspect phrased the way it was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and many of the pictures show students building the costumes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he wording wasnt clear another poster explained how it probably should have been worded udicemonger i suspect that the proper sentence might have been costing between and if you were to buy one these are instead built by a team of volunteers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what if youre doing this to make a disabled kid feel good and maybe a little less selfconscious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im kinky
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems like nobody took the fucking time to read the article and just saw the thumbnail and picture or just had a quick glance at the pictures and then came into the comment section to show their negativity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fortunately with in vitro fertilization they can now test embryos for most genetic diseases so after having one child with a genetic disease most parents decide to use that method if they decide to have more children but many parents have more children before ever knowing that their older children have a genetic defect my cousins had a child after they had a child with a major chromosomal defect because they didnt know that the older child had the defect they almost certainly wouldnt have had another child if they had known if only because of the incredible amount of work and time that they have had to devote to their disabled child she is nonverbal and has major physical impairments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i dont have a inherited degenerative disease but that was my thought as well reading the article i get that some people are very driven to leave their own genetic legacy on the planet but does that really make sense if your genes suck adoption is a good option
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess thats true but they do seem like genuinely lovely people from everything people have said difficult to really dislike them despite that 😕
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it sounds more like you just dont want to be inconvienenced by raising a disabled child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plus a hours of work just to make a kid feel good for an afternoon this kind of stuff happens all the time when working with kids with disabilities you want to make a kid feel good be his friend help the parents and spend those resources on something thatll improve his quality of life ie access ramps etc my point is you relieve all of the guilt and solve a tiny bit of the problem the real heroes are the people that stick around when helping doesnt feel so good edit be clear this is a great idea if your helping someone your already supporting my complaint is this seems to coincide with the feel good quick fix solutions that surrounds the disability community the end result is creating a distorted sense of expectations for the child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats mr good bar cash up front
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont say
UpliftingNews,not_removed,name checks out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well played
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had a sister with edwards syndrome i got to watch her be unable to do anything with tubes and wires hooked to her being on life support her whole life and then eventually dying it would have been better for her to never live at all at that point her existence was miserable at best and completely destroyed my family my older brother the eldest had a good mother and father i the youngest grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother and a distant and bordering on absent father your choice to have a disabled child affects all your children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really to me it sounds like they dont want their child to have to suffer being disabled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree with a lot what of youre saying however i still believe that there is a place for acts like these and that it is unnecessary to disparage them while these volunteers might not provide the most help possible they still provide help not everyone will be a real hero so let them help out where they can i would also posit that they do more to raise awareness than anything else which can lead to the kind of solid support youre talking about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey there mrbig
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes does say
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but your sister also wasnt really living either i dont mean to make that sound harsh but not all disabled people are complete vegetables
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it sounds like they dont want their child to have to suffer being disabled i do want to say that many able bodied people assume that suffer and disabled go hand in hand when they really dont though i have a genetic condition similar to sma and i very much enjoy my life with that said i would not have multiple kids knowing that theres a chance that each baby could get it especially as sma is a spectrum disorder
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so whos going to start the raids on killing disabled people i guess their suffering isnt worth their lives right wed be doing them a favor then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id much rather raise awareness for the things that actually work and help ie giving access ramps etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,taking an existing life is completely different from preventing one from ever existing by your argument anyone who doesnt have a child every months is killing their non existent children by not having them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these people are saying these parents should never have had kids because the kids lives arent worth it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was on a red light camera he chose not to possibly lose his job by covering it up not a heroic choice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wasnt this posted in rnottheonion it even reached rall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh cops theyre just like us only they can murder black folks but look this one gave himself a citation for running a red light i guess eric garners family should just shut the fuck up justice is served
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because all police are the same right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,chinese governor said well there should be at least one place were people dont have to breath pure lead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it does seem like a good idea although a bit late

UpliftingNews,not_removed,good to know they can only amass such a small amount of nutjobs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,never underestimate the capacity of israel to continue being holocaust victims three four or five generations later makes me wonder is this going to the gay polish black gypsy etc victims of the holocaust
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its about history learning and understanding it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its an important part of history
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im waiting for the sequel to mein kampf mein kampf jewno whats coming
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are people alive currently with strings of digits seared into their forearms these people miraculously survived the death camps dont say anything you wouldnt say to such a persons face the numbers of jews killed was factually proportionally larger than any other demographic by a long shot kindly provide examples showing how israel as a country uses the holocaust as an excuse to do anything even if it did would that really be so horrendous in comparison in the us there are reparations going on as apology for the unspeakable horrors african slaves were put through is that something you have a problem with as well i mean the slavery was like forever ago why cant they just like get over it already the proceeds go to any and all survivors please take your racism elsewhere this is a place for uplifting news not ignorant criticism all the best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre going to use a people who have long been discriminated against to prop up your hate of another such group maybe dont use a slur it shows your hand a bit they are rroma people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reparations is a stupid idea because none of the people that would get them arewere slaves they just want a hand out because they been held down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in comparison in the us there are reparations going on as apology for the unspeakable horrors african slaves were put through is that something you have a problem with as well yes who are receiving these funds were they ever a slave
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is valid i often forget that and so i do apologize for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it bothers me a bit that the person filming it was just standing there doing nothing they filmed the dogs seemingly get run over by a train maybe there is more to the story just bothers me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but when pence does it its not uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminder that over of middle easterners hold antisemitic views towards jews

UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope more people talk about this as someone who is constantly freaking out about climate change this sounds like awesome news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,starbucks is a staunchly zionist company i wonder if the starbucks in israel are going to employ these refugees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there they go again putting their politics before their business sense when are they going to realize that liberals protest and conservatives boycott case in point the gra starbucks said that they support the gra and they put up banners saying that they did so conservatives boycotted and there sales dropped on the other side of that chickfila decided that they were going to put out that they supported traditional marriage so the liberals created gay day at chickfila and their sales went through the roof because protesters get hungry and counterprotesters will buy their food to support them liberals vote with their voice and conservatives vote with their money its a very simple concept and all this is doing is eliminating his conservative base
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre expensive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all from dunkin donuts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes since had multiple job offers the guy is going to transition to canadian life just fine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rthedonald is going to love this big time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i treat my nanny like a goddess because she is one any time i have to take a trip somewhere i bring back something nice for her and her kids i thank her every day and i always respect her requests for time off because i know she would never take advantage living abroad i dont have any family so we do traditional christmas together we make tamales and do a secret santa gift exchange i wouldnt want it any other way she loves my son like her own and he loves her in return i can see the good its doing emerging in his personality yes please treat your employees like people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is indeed a very caring and beautiful relationship that you share with your nanny god bless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its so heart warming how they look through our stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how the fuck is this uplifting this mother fucker literally runs death squads
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not going to end well at all it didnt even start well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he probably thought he had to if not they would have accused him of sponsoring terror if they found in cash on him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a retard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the donor of course
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have you ever tried to spend a euro note
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he wont feel guilty and he still receives a finders fee €
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well at least one state has basic protections for its people looking at you paul ryan the federal government really needs to be the one guaranteeing nationwide rights here and its frankly shameful that they arent but this is a good start
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is great i am worried about how theyll leverage you into signing this form you cant get our per month deal unless you sign up for our blackmail bundle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,inevitable gop spin incoming this is a victory for states rights
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does this protect me if my internet inquiry goes to a server in chicago or san fran or anywhere outside of the state i do not know but my belief is this is a national crossstate and even international issue if the government will no longer protect us who will some company yeah right i think we are screwed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well one clever guy quickly set up an internet provider company there and get rich edit a woman suits well too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone american laws system how does a state pass a law that contradicts a federal law
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good job minnesota i doubt my state will do the same
UpliftingNews,not_removed,minnesota wisconsin but even the republicans are a little smart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well if the federal doesnt up hold it and the stars do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this doesnt contradict federal law congress voted to repeal the requirements for isps to keep customer data confidential they are no longer required to do so by the federal government but they can if they want to however they can be required to do so by state legislatures without contradicting the federal law similar situations abound in other kinds of law for example california has stricter emissions standards than the federal government and more gun laws and more food safety laws and more toxicity labeling requirements and they dont let porno actors go without a condom california is basically its own country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so if an isp is based in minnesota they have to protect customer data very interesting thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,depends on how its written it probably applies to any isp thats serving customers in minnesota which means theyll be either local companies or larger national brands comcast att et cetera with local infrastructure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay so att for example has to protect customer data in minnesota but not in another state that doesnt have such laws
UpliftingNews,not_removed,based on the wording of the law in the story yes i think thats correct
UpliftingNews,not_removed,should have bought them some condoms too

UpliftingNews,not_removed,we need more of these are there any others set up around the globe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now start adding oyster and kelp seaweed beds to help filter the water or invite oyster and seaweed farming contracts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kudos to those who came up with this idea this needs to catch on everywhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is great its just the beginning we must fight to save our mother earth from this man made cancer that is pollution renewable resources glass bottles sodas and drinks turn them in so they can be reused more funding for teslas and other eco friendly vehicles
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now build one for land and take it down mlk blvd
UpliftingNews,not_removed,praise helix
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they actually remove the trash from the harbor they dont prevent it from entering
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is amazing especially the googley eyes we need more of these
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is much too much trash in the ocean
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets get that to pay the new york harbor a visit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love when you follow and that links you too the ama the first comment is from upmmedickpictures im imagining that being someones first time on reddit and never coming back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,doesdoes it have giant googly eyes or am i losing it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so only million pounds of trash got in instead of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,garbage is already was in the water it removed it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no wonder it works their whole was basically trash no water good on them that they did something about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,been to the harbor it looks noticeably cleaner thanks mr trash wheel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cool cool maybe the dumb people there should learn to use a trash can just maybe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a fraction of a percent of a drop in the ocean nice sentiment though i guess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this made me laugh so hard imagining it eating ducks but i do feel bad for the ducks did someone have to go in after them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre the topic of conversation again uthemrtrashwheel this time in rupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my friends at clearwater mills hope to build one on the ala wai canal in hawaii soon it would be cool to have a friend to visit there ive always wanted to swim with dolphins from the last ama it they did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gotta be careful zebra muscles got into the great lakes and now they have some issues with algae build up in places the muscles clear the water up so well in places that substantially more sunlight penetrates through so gotta make sure theres enough current around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we also have to fight back in some states teslas are becoming illegal in others you will be needed to pay a fine for driving electric vehicles in others energy thats produced from renewables will be fined per kilowatt hour and coal etc wont theyre repealing environmental legislation and neutering the epa theyre taking down climate data from government websites and theyre silencing national park twitter accounts that tweet about climate change people need to be aware of the things these corrupt assholes are doing we need to fight back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wouldnt that be a street sweeper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which city gets it first it feels like every city i have been to in the us has an mlk there are approximately streets named after king in the united states including in puerto rico according to research by derek alderman head of the geography department at the university of tennessee jan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,came here to post this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you bird jesus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually its the opposite they prevent the litter floating down the riverstream from entering the harbor they are stationary sitting at the bottoms of these water bodies before they empty into the harbor they do nothing to remove trash already in the harbor though baltimore has several boats that do that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i started the petition to get googly eyes put on couldnt have done it without reddits help
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or that being someones first time on reddit and finding their soulmate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lmfao i just asked a simple question cuz i saw he posted his ama on twitter lol didnt expect it to blow up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that picture on the left was from after a major storm as was the picture on the right after the trash wheel was installed though the inner harbor is in terrible shape in the past it only rarely looked that bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats really asking a lot of baltimore natives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was this thing designed for the whole ocean or baltimore harbor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and what would your solution be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what is the ocean but a multitude of drops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one day while driving with my family we saw a dog run on the highway and get run over it was a very somber moment in the car and my kids were very upset i told my kids that i looked back in the review mirror and the dog was just fine i told them them that the dog got up and finished running across the road this made everyone feel better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait do nonasians not eat ducks if you roast them its amazing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uhhhhhh add local genus shellfishand local genus seaweedstheyre rebuilding the oyster reefs in manhattan delta systems to great success zebra muscles got in thanks to bilge water from international shipping
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuuuuuuuuccccccccckkkkkkkk them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i live south of baltimore and these things float around the harbor the trash does not enter from the patapsco river it enters from the storm drains which empty into the harbor from all over the city so the trash shows up in the harbor first then floats around and eventually finds its way into the patapsco river
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rest easy knowing someones first time to this site they saw a username like yours and never came back or pmd you who knows
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not even the whole harbor just a portion of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,comment passive aggressively until my wrist hurts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for that depressing and unrelated anecdote
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh ohhhh oh nooo not the ducks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol yes nonasians eat lots of duck north americans even hunt wild ducks and other game birds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am not sure why im bothering to respond but again you are incorrect if interested on how these work id urge you to either read the cited article google the trash wheels or go see the trash wheels in person the first one mr trash wheel is easily observable from the pomenade next to the marriott in harbor east
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey there fellow marylander mr trash wheel and his new friend professor trash wheel are both stationary at the mouths of the jones falls and harris creek respectively you are correct though that the trash does not enter from the patapsco you might be thinking of the that still go all over the harbor to help keep it clean but now they dont have to run as often thanks to the trash wheels
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unrelated anecdote oh its related when you grow up you learn how to connect all the dots
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i believe this guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,see you in rconspiracy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is wonderful news here are some
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is starting to look up already hopefully china actually enforces the ban
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets see if they actually enforce it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,calling major bs on this they could ban it right now or ten years ago this must be to appease the un whatever whatever committee on endangered species china is the biggest black market for everything im not one to go on huge rants on reddit but come on if theyve mastered nuclear fission surely they can clone elephants ivory in a petrie dish without killing amazing beasts at an alarming rate im not a tree hugger or a sjw but leave the elephants alone at last the way the privileged chinese operate im pretty sure this is a lion in sheeps clothing no pun intended start making your sculptures out of huge cow bones leave the largest and one of the most intelligent land animals alone ffs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish they could ban it earlier but this is a huge step forward even if its halfassedly enforced just by signalling their intention to kill off the ivory trade china should make suppliers feel iffy about the risk they put up with trying to get ivory especially when one of the largest sources of demand dries up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats funny they cold ban it today if they wanted to i guess a years notice will let them make a much profit as possible as demand will undoubtably spike
UpliftingNews,not_removed,go elephants
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is good news and i hope it makes a difference elephants are amazing and beautiful creatures
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but not before
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how brave of them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats amazing news just watched a documentary on netflix called ivory games and it was about the ivory trade really eye opening i recommend watching it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fantastic news and for those who are interested in the topic should watch the ivory game from netflix
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great now dumbo the elephant is going to die in s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you read the article i think its completely fair first of all this is a ban on the trade and processing of ivory which is not nearly as terrible as the actual poaching of course poaching is already banned secondly when new regulations like this are put in place most countries would often have phase out periods like this to give businesses time to adapt as per the article the commercial processing and sale of ivory will stop by march and all registered traders will then be phased out bringing a full halt to the market by the end of the year completely fair and on a reasonable timeline if you ask me the united states only banned the trade of ivory in july its not even a total ban so this is not something that was generally done ten years ago the african poaching crisis only became a major issue rather recently the us ban on it also did not take place immediately it was phased in the comments here that are criticizing the chinese based on this article are completely misguided
UpliftingNews,not_removed,social psychology the public will accept it as evolution instead of revolution and therefore it seems less disruptive centuries of cultural ideologies and all that cmon man chalk this one up as a w

UpliftingNews,not_removed,good everyone deserves the opportunity to be yelled at by a deranged scoutmaster
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in australia they just replaced boy scouts with scouts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are transgender boys m to f or f to m
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read this as not allowed and saw that it was tagged to uplifting news and thought wellwell that doesnt add up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how fucking young is that now that people are making these transformations holy shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,serious question at what age can someone be considered transgender im no expert but intuition tells me you would want to wait until after puberty i knew plenty of girls growing up that identified as tom boys but at some point they grew out of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honest question was there a management or whatever change in bsa after the arguing to allow or not allow gay leaders this seems like quite the shift im glad to see theyre becoming more inclusive just not sure if i missed anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,welp this post is getting locked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im just wondering how early on can someone be sure that they relate to the opposite sex of which they were born into can children before their midlate teens be very sure of their sexual identityorientation edit why the downvote its a serious question im totally fine with someone being whatever they want to be but if a kid says it i cant help but think they are being influenced instead of it being their own choice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,camping and tying younger scouts to trees should be open to everyone glad to see the organization being more inclusive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i kind of see this as another thing boy scouts are going to be made fun of for i am an eagle scout and the number of times i got called gay or a faggot for being in boy scouts was very high i always brushed it off because i dont really care what people think but i had plenty of friends that quit boy scouts because the fact that people made fun of us i just wanted to go camping and not worry about all the dumb things that happen in the world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you know transgender people make up less that half of of our nation and most are harmless i dont get why their existence merits attention lets them pee wherever and do whatever they want it wont effect of americans at all most wouldnt even know they exist if not for tv
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant we just have the scouts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are atheists still not welcome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that moment when all of reddit is an accomplished geneticist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,alright this is good im fine with this everyone should have a chance except for girls though because putting girls in the bsa would make the b pointless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a load of bullshit children should be focusing on school and having fun with friends not taking hormones in order to change their gender what the fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so its offensive and disrespectful that the scouts dont allow girls but its not offensive or disrespectful to the scouts to force them to bend to the will of a very select few individuals this is what ive never understood about this liberalsocial justicepc shit you have to bend to our will and cant make your own guidelines and rules you have to appeal to us or else youre hateful but yet its not hateful for us to force you to change your life long traditions these insane people always try to make everything so black and white right or wrongtheres no just leave us the fuck alone and mind your own business in between if i were the leader of the bsoa id tell these people that i find it offensive and backwards that theyre trying to change my decisions and rights and see how they like the same rhetoric thrown back at them whats the difference
UpliftingNews,not_removed,coming from an eagle scout best of luck to them scouts is for sure a mans club and they are most likely going to be in for a world of hurt if they join a shitty troop with white trash leaders unfortunately there are a fuck ton of white trash leaders and really shitty troops oh and not to mention dickhead year olds who would love nothing better than to shit all over a trans person because they are fucking dick head years olds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this isnt uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uplifting ridiculous more than uplifting the boy scouts is for boys of as far as im aware not many boys have finished puberty by then and to enable them to change their gender through hormone replacement is pretty inarguably insane fully expecting downvotes and thats fine but i would appreciate some sort of actual response rather than just nonsense edit swap boys for girls since it means female to male
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this isnt uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a child getting a gender switch that early what the fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they arent super cool with atheists though we had a section on god and i told my year old he could decide what god was important to him he picked thor since we had just read a book about nordic gods we arent in it anymore his scoutmaster is also the local ccd teacher
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jesus christ whats with all these hateful comments reddit really sucks sometimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as an eagle scout i highly approve this decision and for those who disagree because of how young scouts are i highly doubt that this is really affecting cub scouts boy scouts start in fifth grade and go until you hit ive seen a lot of comments saying you should wait until after puberty to decide on gender identity and that fits in bsa age range anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like boy scouts should probably just be called scouts so everyone can participate sure i also believe if they are in boy scouts theyre too young to be transgender let the child go through puberty and all that jazz before screwing around with their junk they still have a lot of figuring themselves out to do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so when will transgender girls be able to join the girl scouts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so semiboy scouts of america
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how would these young boys know they are transgender before puberty someone better investigate their parents something is very wrong here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the amout of ducking attentionot the trans community gets ccompared to their actual numbers in society is astounding im all for letting anyone be who ever the hell they want to but let the media coverage real news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not surprised people think they are restrictive but in my troop lord knows there were atheists and gays we went on adventures together and were all better for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can transgender girls join girl scouts or are people only worried about guy clubs in the same way that blacks can attend white collegesfrats but not the other way around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love the double standards of liberals transgender girls can be in boy scouts would they be ok with a transgender make playing in professional female sports
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a current boy scout life rank this is awesome news to hear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is there a difference in what the boy scouts and girl scouts do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im going to break form and address this seriously in the interest of full disclosure i got my eagle scout at age and am now if asked arkansas it happens a lot if i go to church i tell people that i am not religious i actively decided to leave the church and my belief in god behind shortly before graduating high school i generally do not affiliate with atheistsism since it has a hugely negative connotation often regardless of perspective and especially in the place i live this will become more obviously relevant later i think this is a great step forward but the largest most fundamental hurdle still lies ahead for the bsa which is an organization that played a huge part in shaping my life and person i felt the exact same way when gay scouts and leaders were finally unbanned from membership a few years back this is an ultimately small move toward the people in power at the bsa realizing what people like me have known about scouting all along that belief in and following the teachings of a higher power pick your favorite the bsa does not discriminate based on the religion as long as you have one that recognizes a power above man i prefer jesubuddazeus is not a prerequisite for being able to acquire values like honesty compassion integrity responsibility and leadership that scouting in my very sincere opinion absolutely does impart to those who participate i firmly believe that children and young adults that go through the program come out at least marginally better people and at best they become the genuinely great people that we all love to be around both personally and professionally the current incarnation of the organizations leadership along with all of those before it believe that such belief is a prerequisite and that the a religious basis for teaching values is absolutely fundamental to children and young adults gaining at least in part an appreciation for the values stated before it was this fundamental belief in a higher power combined with the fact that for pretty much ever and probably still even now the people who run the bsa are christian and mostly conservative that the lgbt and nonreligious communities have been excluded from an organization that many would have likely enjoyed and without such discrimination would not have asked them to sacrifice a base part of who they are if you really want the bsa to be a truly great organization for all of our youth then tell those you know who are a part of the bsa that you feel the same as i do that the benefits of scouting dont necessarily come from a man in the clouds they really come from the actions we perform the relationships we make and the things we achieve and that means that a scout can choose for religion to be a part of that experience if they want and they should feel free to but the bsa has done itself and thousands of interested youth who felt unwelcome due to orientation or religion a disservice as they are people who can benefit from scouting just the same as anyone else edits for grammar and clarity but someones probably going to get stingy anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more camp fire tales of jimmy and tom experimenting i suppose
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now renamed the scouts of america
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is awesome was not expecting to see a story like this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,transboy scouts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,itt lotsa transphobic redditors
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for those looking for an alternative trail life usa wwwtraillifeusacom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a world we live in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like if they go this far they may as well just call it scouts and let everybody join edit just to be clear im not against it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i needed this today thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eagle scout here after years of discrimination against homosexuals its too late for me to change my mind this organization already left a bad taste
UpliftingNews,not_removed,finally
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so girls that identified as boys can join the scouts or are they accepting boys that identify as girls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,omg i read that as not allowed and i almost lost faith thats awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read this as they are not wondered why it was in uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this world has gone to shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so in scouts on camps we use to shower butt naked will the trans scout join in just asking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im can i still fulfill my childhood dreams
UpliftingNews,not_removed,had thought it said not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought all lgbt rights were going to be trampled on because trump is president guess life goes on as usual
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but they arent even boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cool they finally let girls into boyscouts now to let the boys in girlscouts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,today in the most important news ever lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boy scouts is cool until a boy becomes aware of his sexuality once a boy hits puberty with a vengeance he realizes that hanging out with a bunch of younger boys is lame so the introduction of so much sexual identity issues makes the organization so much more lame for boys who are progressing toward eagle this decision by the bsa will bring about its demise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it gay or transgendered i dont know anymore is gay a derogatory term edit its a serious question if some couldnt tell i have no idea if this sounded mean or not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trump fans in disarray not sure whats happening to their country they are getting btfod they are scrambling loading up on of diet coke for the social media war they are about to start
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now just for my clarification this means transgender as in born with both male and female reproductive organs not my year old had a sex change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,liberals are so confused right now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they too have butt holes so i dont see why not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how about girls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as long as theyre not gay right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my understanding was that its pretty much family scouts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he had no proof we poured stove fuel in the fire but he stilled yelled at us doesnt matter that we actually did it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is definitely on a troop by troop basis but my troop was fuckin awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what do you call a comedicjoke response like this another example is when samesex marriage went through and people essentially said good everyone deserves the opportunity to experience insert some negative aspect of marriage here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn this is relatable my troopscoutmaster is cool but my brother and i have gotten screamed at for literally no reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ahem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,excellent equality for all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shame we havent done that here yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,transgender boys means f to m born with female parts but male in the brain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy shit i read it as not as well was super confused not i feel better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait till the next executive order comes in and youll read it on rnottheonion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah thank god for comments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,weird i did as well i guess were all expecting to hear bad news on a daily basis now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same here but thought it was just news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha i read it the same way and accidentally upvoted it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,being trans doesnt mean running out and getting an operation especially not for kids there are many hoops to jump through and lots of money involved
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this jesus christ i know fuckall about myself at that age
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boy scouts is open to youths up to in the oa technically a trans person between that age really isnt that hard to believe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,transitioning is a lot easier and so much safer before puberty hits for obvious reasons dont think its a spur of the moment decision its after years of counselling with psychologists and therapists
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know a little girl who is years old who has dressed as a boy since she was about or as soon as she could express her preference i have no idea if shell be trans or just a butch lesbian but shes definitely told her parents that dressing like a boy is her strong preference
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my best friend growing up knew at people made shitty comments to his parents and he overheard when he was and stopped being so adamant about it found out the actual term at and had fully socially transitioned at no hormones or surgery til obviously this was years ago so way before almost anyone else that young had transitioned some people just know
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know right its so cruel the parents are crazy these kids have not yet hit puberty and they want them to change their sex before they even experience sexuality im sorry youre unfit to be a parent and should have your kids taken away in transphobe im really not i just care about child wellbeing more than your political agenda
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am a trans girl puberty is probably the worst thing to happen to trans individuals as it causes the development of largely irreversible secondary sex characteristics in my case trying to change my voice bone structure etc puberty can be delayed or different hormones administered if a child has very strong convictions about their identity this is also not an easy process to initiate requiring a therapists evaluation and recommendation of treatment to ensure that this isnt a phase if this was presented as an option when i was going through puberty i would have jumped at the chance before my body developed the wrong way anyway my opinion i hope this gives you some things to consider
UpliftingNews,not_removed,any age when they can find the words to tell you how they feel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the reality is it was always troop by troop some of us were chill
UpliftingNews,not_removed,part of the reason is that topics such as homosexuality and transgenderism have become far more mainstream than they were even a few years ago in years past part of the bsas reasoning on excluding some young men and even adult leaders was because they did not feel that it was their place to create an environment in which hot button topics such as gay marriage and other lgbtqa issues would surface from which johnny tenderfoot would take questions back to his parents parents that did not yet want or know how to answer those questions as these issues have become more accepted by the american culture the bsa has followed suit with some delay to ensure its members wouldnt raise much protest edit also there was a leadership change a number of years ago robert gates became the organizations ceo and began to turn the wheels to have a more inclusive organization
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the reality is the boy scouts were running out of local funding and since they banned gays etc they werent eligible for federal funding fast fwd a couple years and now that gays and trans are allowed they have access to funding and everyone is happy everyone can continue stick fighting with a flash light casting a shadow on their tent at night
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they stopped letting the mormons who donated lots of make the moral decisions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant believe this is rupliftingnews these people are really not happy about this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree scouting is an opportunity that should be available to everyone its a challenge that builds character and perseverance anyone could benefit from that a scout ishelpful friendly courteous kind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,considering that being trans is by most credible scientist and doctors a mental issue and not some physical thing this means that right off the bat trans people are suffering from what is most likely a mental problem so asking if kids can be sure of their identity is a false statement from the getgo as to sexual identity in general most teenagers dont know what they wantyou think some or year old knows anything about this stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,less than is anything under about people in the us alone i dont know about you but that is an uncomfortable number of lives to say that dont matter just because it wont affect you or many others doesnt mean that their lives and the real issues they face do not matter that is thoughtless an impassionate thing to suggest the very reason why it merits attention is because society refuses to grant them those rights the rest of us enjoy if it were that easy of course it wouldnt merit attention there would be no problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most are harmless well the problem is that a lot of people very much dont think so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont get why their existence merits attention because people matter regardless of their sexual identity orientation or how many of them there are the world doesnt revolve around what straight people experience or dont experience
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there existence may not merit attention but there are some of them who demand it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,going to give you an upvote because downvotes are coming your way i said the same thing and suggested that parents hold off on calling their kids transgender until after puberty when they have a better sense of self got destroyed for having a halfassed conservative opinion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,another eagle another fan of this i was very seriously considering turning in my eagle as a protest for a while there i kinda settled on screw the bsa i earned this a lot of props and credit goes to the eagles who did turn theirs in not an easy decision and i am sure its played a part in the shifts of the past few years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same here this is a big step forward for the bsa
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep similar story here i have brothers and when i was a kid i wanted to be a boy id wear boys clothes get my hair cut short told everyone i was a boy etc im now and identify as a straight woman or white cis scum as were now known
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everything ive read thats not bias shows that gender issues are mental problems and not actual biological or genetic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah youre still allowed to have member category based clubs at some level
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where did it mention having a sex change¿
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you said it unfortunately the human brain is not perfect and conditions like gender dysphoria naturally arise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems to be a matter of perspective such is the beauty of subjectivity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes the simplest explanation is this your sex is what your born with your gender is what you identify as i and others believe that if you identify as a gender you should be allowed to be treated at that gander many do not agree
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boy scouts is for for those out of the loop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,isnt terribly early for someone to realize theyre trans
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is an organization allowed to have core values anymore i mean come on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ccd
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,read the article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you really shouldnt be so preoccupied with the genitalia of children seriously it isnt relevant to this conversation at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you dont believe children have any sense of their own gender why have a boys only group then and true that some may not know the term trans as children its a fairly common story actually to hear from trans people that they always knew they were different and then things clicked for them when they learned about transgendered people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boy scouts arent really prepubescent some are i suppose but with the age of to theres a lot of young men who are in scouting past puberty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sexual identity gender has nothing to do with sexuality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is this so upsetting to you dont tell me its because you cant stand for the injustice of the hypothetical mental abuse of these children because that makes no sense why does this really bother you so much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is a non issue prepubescent children are not transgender it is not something that exists at that young of an age if a child thinks they are transgender at such a young age then their parents are pushing that view point onto their children which is totally wrong it takes so long to gain your identity as a person never mind your sexual identity it is ridiculous to think otherwise i read some one above me speaking of puberty blockers i hope that really isnt a thing if it is it should be fucking illegal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was really hoping for more positivity from a fucking uplifting news sub but with the state of the world right now im happy with any type of progress no matter how small
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also an eagle scout how would this have gone over in your troop i feel like it would have been an unmitigated disaster if we had a trans person in our troop i also got my eagle in and am though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,explain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they arent boys read the article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,naw man its thinking critically on and having intelligent conversation regarding this stuff is taboo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the mental situation is reversible what the fuck are you on about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they arent boys though yes they are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are girl scouts too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so i got down voted because this wasnt super liberal right just trying to figure out whats so wrong with saying boys and girls can do the same thing and people have a better sense of identity postpuberty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there have been cases of gender dysphoria long before it was trendy trans youth dont go through discrimination and bullying because they like it for you to say that being trans is a fad shows how uninformed on the issue you are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpswwwscientificamericancomarticleistheresomethinguniqueaboutthetransgenderbrain there are those who truly do feel like a stranger in their own body their feelings are backed by real concrete physical differences in the brain this is why the mainstream method of treatment is transitioning i agree that we need to be careful to not purposefully engage other impressionable young adults but those who come to these conclusions themselves need to be accepted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank god we have an expert here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a child doesnt always know what they want for sure but for other medical problems like depression anxiety they would still be taken seriously and the child would be evaluated by a professional able to determine if they truly are suffering as they say i wonder why not treat gender dysphoria the same
UpliftingNews,not_removed,totally agree tomboys are not boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kids should always be taken seriously yeah it might be a phase or it might be totally serious either waytreat it totally serious the very worst that will happen is that they know you supported them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how did you come up with age of by the way also i keep seeing this claim that being transsexual is trendy if trendy means being ostrocised by peer adults and pretty much everyone else in the world i dont see how this will ever be the new gladiator sandal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my personal experiences led me to believe that some people are just born different and have a right to not have gender roles forced on them my exgirlfriends daughter was when i met them even then she hated all things girlie and wanted to be a boy now at she wants to play tackle football and has zero interest in anything related to femininity its not environment as her mother was raised traditional catholic opus dei and is not happy with this but she loves her daughter and tries her best to be supportive dad is mia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyve been able to for a while
UpliftingNews,not_removed,article from since for sure they rejected a donation in because it was contigent on rejecting trans girls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there have been transgender girls in girl scouts but its still a contentious issue in that organization
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trans girls have always been welcome in girl scouts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes both teach leadership a lot but there are big differences those differences disappear as scouts get older venture scouts and such are coed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i see you dont understand basic facts of biologypsychology dont worry everyone was like that at one point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i talk like this you know im right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most girls arent trying to get into the scouts and these girls that think theyre boys are more of a problem then the boy scouts theres no way for a year old to know what gender they are or arent its well known that gender identification problems are a mental issue and not some biological or genetic difference instead of trying to get organizations like the bsoa to change their policies we need to get these kids some help and ask their parents what their problem is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no boys read it again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,girls could always join the bsa as far as i know there were several at the summer camp we had each year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where does it mention anything about girls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you are confused please see my comment to seedeez to clear things up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,less discrimination is gross explain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive seen this before one flaw is its not as recognized as the boy scouts an eagle rank carries some clout and can be a big thing on resumes for jobs or applications for college and such plus it seems for difficult for access to high adventure stuff like sea base in florida philmont in new mexico boundary waters in minnesota or tinnermans in new york they can still do all the same activities but its more difficult to gain access to some higher level stuff for boundary waters you need written permission from the national park service in the us and its equivalent in canada
UpliftingNews,not_removed,individuals that were assigned female at birth that now identify as boys the girl scouts have accepted maletofemale children for some time now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,f to m born females that identify as male
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no boys can join the scouts thats what the article is about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it scouts fixed it for ya
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a scout is trustworthy loyal helpful friendly courteous kind lets just stop there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when was this as a boy scout i never did this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,username checksout
UpliftingNews,not_removed,transgendered girls would be eligible for the girl scouts because their brain identifies with that of a girl pretty simple stuff im amazed how confused some of you are by this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,read the article so you dont look like a buffoon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,transgendered boys are not girls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is actually about daughters joining
UpliftingNews,not_removed,read the article before you sound like an idiot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,here the simplest explanation you can get sex is what your born with and gender is what you identify as no one is giving their children sex changes however some parents do allow their children to take hormone from a young age as it is most effective in preteen years and someone born with both organs is an entirely different discussion transgendered means your that the gender you identify with is not the same as the sex you were born with i among others believe you should be free to be treated as the gender you identify with and there are those that dont
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not really sex is what your born with and gender is what you identify as i among others believe you should be free to be treated as the gender you identify with and there are those that dont simple as that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stove fuel scout juice ftfy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i got branded in the ass with tongs by the person on kp duty while i was on my pants had to be removed from my ass by the camp medic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think you just call it a joke lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so before this it was pretty much the penis scouts their cookies dont sell as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do feminists insist that females are equal if there is indeed a male and female brain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,heeeeey
UpliftingNews,not_removed,comment will go by underrated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes please provide a source for any number of preteens undergoing srs i cant see any doctor agreeing to provide plastic surgery on a childs genitals edit i think i misunderstood you are saying gender reassignments aka hormone replacement therapy or hormone blockers not sexual reassignment surgery lol if people realized i am trans and not at all against gender reassignment for preteens i might not have so many upvotes or maybe reddit has pulled a and is all about trans justice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at the age youre thinking of reassignment is probably nothing more than a pronoun clothing and haircut add puberty blockers when theyre around or so ill want sauce on those lots of doctors and massive problems
UpliftingNews,not_removed,source
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you do know the minimum age for srs is seriously if you want to know anything about what its like to be trans please ask im more than happy to answer any questions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sex reassignment reconstruction of the genitals requirements vary between insurance agencies and doctors but generally the individual needs to have been living as their preferred gender for an extended period they must have a recommendation from one or multiple psychologists been taking prescribed hormones and in some cases must be or older if you are referring to hormone treatments the effects are in almost all cases reversible should the individual change their mind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bullshit ive never once heard that from any reputable source
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont mean this in any kind of bigoted way i was under the impression that gender change surgery didnt actually relieve a lot of the psychological symptoms associated with people who feel they are the wrong gender like depression anxiety etc and the science was still out on whether the procedure had medicinal value is this not the case am i mistaken genuinely curious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wheres the receipts on this comment doctors of course there are more gender reassignment cases than before because theres finally a bit of tolerance non of the hormonal treatments for kids are irreversible but you keep doing you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a boy scout is a venturer already coed is plenty old enough to make a decision i wouldnt expect this to impact cub scouts although the program is already coed in most of the world anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,confirmed for not having a clue what youre talking about have a source for that made up statistic i didnt think so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can i drive no can i drink no can i get life changing surgery to try to become another sex sure sweetie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hows is that legal iv wonderd i mean people should able to do what they want but children should be given much more time to develope before you pump em full of hormones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think people and parents in particular especially when discussing this instance care about that generally speaking we want our kids to be happy i dont think anyone gives much of a shit if their daughter is drawn to action figures or if their son likes girly princess movies its when that completely genuine and innocent fraction of their life suddenly defines an enormous part of who they are kids are developing the concept of me every day and that journey is a rough one to start with why do we have to even have this discussion with them at very young ages i cant imagine a parent asking little timmy if he feels like a girl why would you do that you know timmy has a boys private area if it isnt just understood that hes a boy and he was to ask you just tell him hes a boy and explain that girls are a little different than boys but equal of course just different at that point if he objects and hes serious not just annoying you on purpose then yeah maybe start watching him and address it if it is legit some people are being reckless in this way potentially fucking with their kids at the risk of seeming closed minded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which is probably fine but lets not give her life altering and permanent medical procedures quite yet if we can avoid it yeah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he didnt knew shit at or at about anything and especially not about sexuality before even hitting puberty dont be ridiculous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,many trans people dont even transition and that takes years by itself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre not a transphobe as it seems you just dont understand the medical or scientific positions behind this serious issue transphobes are people who refuse to acknowledge the medical and scientific justifications for something like this and often times actively seek out posts to insult the kids or parents id recommend reading a bit on it avoid politicized sources like cnn bbc fox news breitbart etc and only read the research and medical papers and stances thats what i did when i wanted to learn more about why people would do something like that especially so young and it should be anyones practice before they get all upset about a topic they dont understand i think its unfortunate that you see it as a political agenda though i come about it from a place of science personally and while i cant grasp it emotionally i understand full well that variations like these kids deal with crop up in other species are quite serious and are likely something we should push to understand even further there is a political side but that is not the driving force behind this it is a medical issue that is gaining more momentum as a result of public exposure but it still remains a medical issue that said all the major medical organizations in this country already take a protransition stance for trans individuals so its less about whether trans is real or not and more about whether you believe in modern medicine and i for one will always defer to my doctor for anything medical until i get that phd
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well boy scouts is for kids ages in some circumstances can be well past puberty in addition its typically the kids making the choice to transition stories of parents forcing transitions of kids tend to be the fodder of talk radio loons
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont mean to be insensitive im simply asking if you happen to know what sort of effect on the body does blocking puberty have does it literally just stop you from growing and maturing edit thank you for the response im going to do more research on this before i form an opinion but i thought puberty blockers were permanent it seems i was mistaken
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it does thanks for the reply
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea if someone has gender dysphoria after a meeting with a trained psychiatrist properly trained is key as not all have the necessary information or training and they determine they have the disorder the best thing is puberty blockers until they are a legal adult then its their choice but until they are an adult we shouldnt be giving children hormones until they have a good sense of who they are most people dont even when they turn but you cant stop them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah children are great at making informed decisions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,feel i wanted to be a dog when i was little thank god the world wasnt ruled by liberals by then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it also helps they are owned by the united way a huge portion of funding comes from them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,welcome to rupliftingnews ive seen many comment threads about lives saved that start with incredible cynicism edit meant saved not said
UpliftingNews,not_removed,an eagle is a scout has completed all of the requirements to earn that rank he has the tools but it is up to him to use them properly and make ethical choices i remind each scout of this when i pin the eagle on their uniform
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no no less than one percent is anything under million people in the united states alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think youre misreading the person youre responding to it was inelegantly put but i think the point being made is here let them pee wherever and do whatever they want the idea being that even if you have a problem with them youre not likely to have much contact with them anyway so let it go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of the us population not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think youre misreading the person youre responding to it was inelegantly put but i think the point being made is here let them pee wherever and do whatever they want the idea being that even if you have a problem with them youre not likely to have much contact with them anyway so let it go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fellow brother pleasure to meet you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sexuality does not have any place in boy scouts its not sometging that needs to be brought in its the bsa caving to pressure from extreme liberals wanting them to accept their particular views which are horrendous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh boy i dont even know what it stands for catholic kids have to go every week to a ccd class to learn about god stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay maybe im confusing gender and identity because that makes fucking sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes it is its their gender and nobody knows if its actual distress about their gender most of the time its just a tomboy phase and theyll grow out of it now hating themselves because what we let them do at less than years old
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because when a parent coerces their child into believing they were born the wrong gender that is fucked up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how about you chill the fuck out and stop assuming he is evil because he has different view point on this topic its obviously polarizing you just need to grow up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because this will create more emotionally unestable people that will eventually hurt society
UpliftingNews,not_removed,feeling as one gender or the actually has to do with the architecture of someones brainduring fetal development theres sometimes hiccups in hormone balances and timing that would cause the brain to develop as one gender and the genitals to develop as the opposite sex not only is it very possible to test out whether presenting as the opposite gender feels right trying different outfits or activities possibly even different names are only a few ways for this testing but there is a very clear biological source for gender dysphoria that being the body the brain attempts to work with not matching how one looks or is treated heres an analogy that could possibly communicate the feeling of gender dysphoria if you or anyone else has any sort of questions or thoughts id be willing to talk more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ask any trans person if you have any around you you probably do but dont know it they know from a very young age but often cant articulate it since they are not exposed to the concept imagine every time you see yourself in the mirror you expect someone else or you dont recognize the person reflected really take a few minutes to imagine it thats how they feel most people transition very late in their life because theyve been drilled to believe it will pass and they live extremely miserable you and i are lucky to not have to face those issues and we have our own challenges it doesnt mean their challenges are ridiculous imagined or trivial
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant smoke a cigarette or vote in an election but you can chop off your testes and invert your penis life altering procedures like this should not be allowed at this age what a time to be alive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as an eagle scout who was pissed off with the ban on openly gay people from joining this is great news scouting was a big part of my life and im really happy with how much progress they made
UpliftingNews,not_removed,imagine if i posted a political article of something that you disagreed with here it makes no sense uplifting news trump signs bill stating for every regulation added two have to be removed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i got my eagle in so im not that much younger i was actually in a more progressive troop so i think it could have worked some parents of younger scouts might have balked but the older boys would have been fine the scouts would have taken it better than the parents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems like you arent doing anything to fix that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ever heard of a tom boy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im an attack helicopter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no their not what youre doing is supporting a mental illness which will cause nothing but hurt for the individual of trans people have considered suicide they would be happier living a normal life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay right on im from canada and cadets beaver younger kids and bear older kids scouts are the big youth programs i dont hear a whole lot about girlboy scouts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,citations this is an interesting issue right because there are some studies that also say people regret sex change and get depressed so if what youre saying has some backup there is the possibility of positive and negative effect for both action and nonaction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes not saying being trans is inherently a fad hes saying kids go through fads plenty of kids love being contrarians and going against the grain just for the hell of it gender dysphoria is real but kids children do not have a developed enough sense of who they are to make a call like that before theyve even reached puberty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont you think its possible that some children might pick it up as a fad kids emulate others and pick up new ideas all the time they identify with the types of music that theyre friends listen to they like the things that their friends like why cant that be possible with transgenderism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and we still have cases of apotemnophilia but no reasonable surgeon is going to cut off somebodys leg because the patient says that they feel like they shouldnt have that leg they get counseling
UpliftingNews,not_removed,their feelings are backed by real concrete physical differences in the brain but i was told gender was just a construct of society
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kids should always be taken seriously this could not be less accurate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,being a tom boy transgender
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually i just looked it up they started in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,since
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are the reason trump won
UpliftingNews,not_removed,venturing includes both boys and girls my crew is awesome those kids know how to have fun without getting into trouble
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no apparently they feel it appropriate to allow girls now if they pretend to be a boy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,friendly note transgender is the preferred adjective over transgendered the idea is that an individual is transgender it isnt something that one day happens to them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is mayonnaise a gender
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats something very different
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was boy scout magic water for us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah man girls scout juice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bonk hahaha im running circles around ya
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i know but what kind of joke its like im not saying this development is a good thing or a bad thing but heres an unexpected cynical contribution
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unsubstantiated bullshit is believing that you can tell a totally rational person that the way they feel about themselves is wrong the way they feel about themselves doesnt affect you so why do you even care
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would like to hear an honest explanation as to why you believe that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your trolling is unsubstantiated bullshit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,grrrrr these people are different than me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it has actually led to a large rift in the lgbtq community for years many feminist leaders argued that brain distinctions were patriarchal and misogynistic only to be confronted by a transgender movement that claimed male and female brains were essential aspects of human beings so much so that someone could literally be born with the wrong brain alignment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because all these brains are human
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i can see surgery being done on a childs genitals it happens often enough with intersex babies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,puberty blockers isnt that unwise i mean im all for dictating your own gender but should you really be allowed to make such a drastic decision so young and isnt it an irreversible one at that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fortune cookie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpswwwacpedsorgthecollegespeakspositionstatementsgenderideologyharmschildren
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hormone treatments are not reversible there are many lasting permanent effects
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really hormones after your body has stopped developing are one thing but hormones while your body is still developing is an entirely different thing they strongly affect a lot of psychological and physical development i highly doubt that those effects are reversible you better have a source for such an extreme assertion edit fixed typo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no one is doing that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpswwwtransactiveonlineorgresourcesyouthpubertyblockersphp in summary puberty blockers delay the development of testes or ovaries and therefore the production of testosterone and estrogen respectively
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so they should remain physical children until age that seems a bit odd to say the least i think which is when puberty is mostly done is a good enough age maybe to be sure if theyre old enough to have their bodies mature naturally theyre old enough to have their bodies mature artificially
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do they need to be informed no one is going in for surgery here they are finding out who they are they might be wrong but thats part of finding out the important part though the really critical partthey might be right so give them the chance to be right about it and dont hassle them if they were wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,each organization is seperate the united way has a history of donating to the bsa over the last few years the united way as a whole has split its opinion on the bsa with some branches continuing to donate while others dropping out completely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah ptsd form abusive parents who try to force their children into normative gender roles can be a really difficult obstacle for many thankfully they find the support they need in their friends and their communities to live true to themselves even if they dont receive that support from their parents edit not trans but im gay but my parents tried to force their heterosexuality on me how many months of beatings do yall think i received when my mom excruciatingly through the computers cookies to find evidence of my homosexuality dont you dare fucking tell me that straight parents dont try to coerce their children to play normative roles because its utter bullshit i went through it and im in my
UpliftingNews,not_removed,accept particular views dont discriminate against trans what do you mean
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are confusing gender and sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you support them and love them they wont hate themselves if they grow out of itok then they grew out of it i guarantee you they will be more fucked up though if you just deny their identity and force your own impression on their life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wut i am not clear on your point something about cars in trafficdoesnt seem germane to the conversation though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why are you convinced that thats the case though do you have any personal experience with this issue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im perfectly chill you seem to be the one whos extremely upset over an innocuous comment on the internet one not even directed at you why does this issue upset you so much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if this is true it contradicts the gender is a social construct stuff also it needs more research before we start prescribing hormones for yo kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not to mention the health problems nothing too bad just some cancer here and there kidney failure oh and osteoporosis but libs care more about personal freedoms than the burden that it puts on society and on families in general
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same great news in a dark time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i recently learned that if you an outspoken or confirmed atheist the national or local council can strip you of your eagle scout rank which is odd because i have been since i was or and my troop didnt care and i still got my eagle but if someone wanted to make a stink they could make it happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you and congratulations on earning your eagle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not sure whats so political about this tbh boy scoutsif you identity as male youre in seems pretty logical to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,naw man im inviting dialogue on the topic i have a comment a little farther down if you want to contribute something intelligent feel free if you want to post a passive aggressive comment that attempts to dismiss dialogue dont edit just fixed an error were all good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i get that you think that which means you have some things to learn about the world good news though is that you have time good luck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i doubt it its probably more likely you are indulging in an absurdism because you think it makes a point you are trying to trivialized a very serious issue to some people by constructing an example that you dont really believe just to try to silence the conversation of people that are trying to do nothing more than have their very sense of self respected why people try so hard to disregard that when it costs them absolutely nothing is something i will never get
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of trans people have considered suicide because people keep on fucking insisting on telling them that they are messed up and deranged is it any fucking wonder imagine where wed be if they were acceptedas people as men or women and just allowed to get on with this life of theirs that hurts no one else the simple act of accepting someone damn it all you make my point better than ive been able to make it yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you do know that gender dysphoria is a thing and that boy scouts go until grade when a child is not trying to be aggressive but i believe that this is not meant for the edgy teen who wants to be different but for people with an actual problem who want to join
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude kids start displaying gendered behavior super early infant girls will independently choose social toys dolls and boys will choose mechanical toys out of a room full of options gender is so strongly biological and all the research supports that so yes a year old can know they are transgender this doesnt mean a doctor is going to do reassignment surgery on a prepubescent kid it just means the kid will have parents and professionals advocating for them to be themselves from an early age hopefully preventing bullying and mental health issues in the future
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there isnt a fucking year old in the world that has any opinion in the world about whether they should be a girl or a boy bullshit i mean total bullshit you simply dont have the research to support such a statement you just want it to be true so you claim it is true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think that because the boy scouts goes into highschool and those scouts can go on to become scout leaders its important to not alienate a person just because they are different of the population is trans so its not like its going to be a huge impact but for those few select kids who are trans that want to be involved in scouting that before now were banned all together this is a doorway for them to learn and be accepted into a welcoming group
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im willing to bet so also and id say the same with homosexuality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gender roles are what youre talking about its the specific attributes society at large gives to a gender gender identity is what is off in transgender individuals and it is innate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,look i can tell you as the father of a kid that isnt sure it isnt nurture it is nature i dont know what my son will decide straight gay or trans but that is his decision no one is pushing kids into changing genders this is just something that happens it has always happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,noit is that doesnt mean we that they do whatever they want but they should never just be dismissed their thoughts and experiences should never be trivialized take them seriously
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres nothing wrong with letting your son join the boy scouts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope thats not it read it again they are admitting boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if so then why are we allowing them to live with this disorder and not treating it like any other brian disorder the cure is to let them transition not having them transition doesnt remove the dysphoria right now theres no thing to do that can make it go away except for transitioning cancer is nigh uncurable but we do our damndest to make sure ppl with it are as comfortable as possible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we dont really have a way to cure it and most attempts at doing so thus far have typically caused more harm than good in this case its just better to mold the body to fit the mind since it doesnt really hurt anyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah well say what we want
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there it is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you find it dried up in dirty socks during camping trips crustier and cruchier than tin foil
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now i know what youre thinking but thats what the older kids in my troop called their travel bottles of liquor they brought on outings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,magic scout water here well and that was lighter fluid rather than stove fuel but still same principle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,still just a joke lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anti joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because theres no reason for me to believe some notion of having a male brain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your accusation that im trolling is unsubstantiated bullshit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he wasnt saying he hated transgender people chill out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,grrrrrrr
UpliftingNews,not_removed,puberty blockers only work as long as you take them if a child decides they dont want to go through with a transition for any reason they just stop taking the blockers theyre a pause button on puberty not a full stop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre already used for kids who undergo precocious puberty so its something we already have familiarity with using and have experience with once stopped the child proceeds through normal puberty so really its the least drastic option letting your body go through puberty is far more irreversible and drastic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no but breasts are hard to get rid of once they develop blockers can be stopped and puberty will happen naturally
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not irreversible and many find that the potential risk of suicide and depression are worse than the potential side effects from puberty blockers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are fully reversable so im in support of questioning kids making that kind decision
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its definitely no worse than girls who get implant birth control which often inhibits puberty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes its super unwise to the point of being cruel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh shit i just woke my baby up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,logic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah that sounds like a perfectly reasonable group just for fun though lets check and the american college of pediatricians acpeds is a socially conservative advocacy group of pediatricians and other healthcare professionals in the united states oh well i the group was founded in by a group of pediatricians including joseph zanga a past president of the american academy of pediatrics aap as a protest against the aaps support for adoption by gay couples huh well maybe founder joseph zanga has described it as a group with judeochristian traditional values that is open to pediatric medical professionals of all religions provided that they hold true to the groups core beliefs that life begins at conception and that the traditional family unit headed by an oppositesex couple poses far fewer risk factors in the adoption and raising of children oh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fyi httpsenwikipediaorgwikiamericancollegeofpediatricians and is not the same thing as the american academy of pediatrics which is an actual medical organization
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just a little info on who youre referencing there httpsenwikipediaorgwikiamericancollegeofpediatricians yes i realize the irony that im referencing wikipedia but it still gives enough of the back story to raise some questions about them as a source on transgender medicine id sooner trust publications from the aap who would be more the go to source on all things pediatrics for the us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you familiar with the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiamericancollegeofpediatricians theyre a httpwwwsnopescomamericaspediatriciansgenderkids and are well known for the research youre citing just look at what kind of httpswwwacpedsorgthecollegespeaksinthemedia cite their content i dont think theyre an applicable or unbiased source to be used in this conversation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just fyi that group is not the american academy of pediatrics aap which is considered to be the main professional medical pediatricians group the acp has members compared to over for the aap and its views seem to correlated with other faith based groups such as teaching abstinence i would not consider this to be an objective source on the matter whether the points made here are valid would require further checking but seeing what their other views are id take this with a grain of salt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the authors of that paper are also against gay marriage and abortions httpsenwikipediaorgwikiamericancollegeofpediatricians
UpliftingNews,not_removed,puberty delaying drugs such as lupron or spironolactone have no lasting effect as without them the body proceeds with a normal puberty estrogenprogesteronetestosterone on the other hand do have permanent effects but they are rarely administered to children under the age of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i will agree that there are some irreversible effects if hormone therapy is continued for long enough maletofemale many of the effects of hormone therapy are reversible if you stop taking them the degree to which they can be reversed depends on how long you have been taking them breast growth and possibly sterility are not reversible httpstranscareucsfeduarticleinformationestrogenhormonetherapy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id do your own research if i were you but according to phsaca they are in fact fully reversable and puberty will happen as normal once the kid stops taking them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but they arent mature enough at thay age they are still impressionable at that age thats why i vote towards puberty blockers until they are seeing as they are legal adults then we cant stop them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what normative gender roles are you referring to being in the girl scouts instead of boy scouts the convergence of gender roles in modern day is one of the greatest humanitarian feats of this century a young girl and a young boy have incredibly similar upbringings these days they both play sports and they both play with toys and each other they learn in the same classroom and learn the same things so what normative roles do parents force on their year olds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay whats the difference between the three
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my troop had several myself included and nobody gave a shit not our scout masters not other scouts not other parents not even the owners of the church we had our weekly meetings in except one guy this guy from the council made a point to be on all of our eagle board of reviews and just grilled the shit out of us he would at pissed at you for being weak if you gave in but would be angrier if you didnt that guy sucked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im afraid science isnt on your side being smug and dismissive wont help you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey look this guy thinks social sciences trumps real science
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think hes an attack helicopter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are being incredibly heliphobic right now and its triggering me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think its particularly nice to encourage gender identity disorder the rate is in excess of before and after surgery the idea that society is responsible for transgender suicide is wrong this rate is only comparable to jews during the holocaust and i dont think transgender people experience this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i grew up when it was fun to pick on gay people we do not live in that world anymore and the acceptance of trans people has been insanely fast in comparison its not that bad anymore the old nobody would chose to be discriminated against argument it quickly fading and it should kids totally grab onto whatever will make them unique if i had a dollar for every girl in school who was gay id have like a nice dinner
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you really think kids understand the discrimination of transgender people in society when theyre
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for the reply this was exactly the response i was hoping for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about the people who believe they should be blind or paralyzed some people believe one of their limbs is not theirs and want it removed should their bodies be molded to fit their brains sever their spinal cords amputate their limbs where is the line between mental illness and a persons identity as
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah same we used lighter fluid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are fuckin with this persons mind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in what way is this a mental illness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre talking about the david reimer case study thats just one theory of a httpsenwikipediaorgwikicausesoftranssexuality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think we need to tackle the problem of suicide rates preop and postop being the same first
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think that youll find many advocating girls taking birth control before or for most of puberty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,puberty blockers are temporary and last only as long as theyre being taken without them puberty resumes as before
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so from the ass
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup theyre the fake kfc of doctoring httpsimgurcomaxvgeb
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the help they need is just to be supported and loved beyond thatthey are a kid if they dont have someone standing over them telling them they are being a kid the wrong way then they will ultimately just get out there and play and eat junk food kids only care about this stuff in so much as the adults in their life imprint their own preconceptions on them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gender identity is the head it is ones sense of who they are in this world sex is chromosomal mapping in most people they match in some they dont hormones are a tricky part of the equation studies have shown that they can play a role and that can contribute to someones gender identity being different than their sex but its not always that simple
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i think that you should reread my question im asking you why you think thats happening here why do you think thats the issue at hand parents convincing their children of anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oooh careful now it is on my side this is studied a lot and the psychiatric field in general is largely in support of this view nowadays
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youve confused sex and gender do some research then come back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,funny fact about social sciences there is real science in it science isnt just beakers and bunsen burners
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i doubt it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hug
UpliftingNews,not_removed,encourage gender identity disorder im not encouraging it i am just accepting people for who they are the idea that society is responsible for transgender suicide is wrong no it isnt societal pressures and attitudes are at the heart of it just read the comments here its shit like that risks driving anyone to suicide imagine what it must be like to get attitudes like that from everyone you meet in real life at your work in your family in your neighbourhood from trying to meet people to date every single person telling you youre wrong youre sick delusional or a freak being denied jobs places to live proper medical care getting condemned by sanctimonious moralizing people and you wonder why they have difficulty putting their chin in the air and laughing it off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where is this misinformation coming from that a kid can just change gender at the whim of his or her feeling they have to go to a whole traject of therapists and doctors who arent allowed to just approve therapy in addition the gross majority if not all doesnt actually have any invasive medication or surgery until theyre young adults yes there is likely people who deviate from the required path people not following the rules but thats not different from any other medical field if anything advocate proper nontaboo legislation to properly guide the process the current taboo makes reasonable laws impossible causing a bit of an allornothing atmosphere tldr thats already supposed to be the case early invasive changes are pretty controversial edit i want to point out that uwildmuppetparade here doesnt say anything unusual except for the assumption that that isnt already the case upvotes foster a healthy discussion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trans doesnt mean they are having surgical changes identity isnt sex im not an expert on this shit but kids dont have a problem with this stuff overly sexualized adults do people even as kids need space and respect and understanding fwiw i would never encourage my kids to join boy scouts due to their historical platform of intolerance maybe we can all learn something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now is a decision the fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is why one of the requirements for sex reassignment surgery is the recommendation of a therapist it isnt a decision that is treated lightly nor is it recommended or desired in all cases conversion therapy the retraining of an individual to accept their assigned gender is largely falling out of favor due to increasing the rate of self harm in patients as it has been shown to do for homosexual people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well no one was asking little billy for her outlook on foreign policy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ehive stirred up the nest not the first time though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all of those things lead to loss of functionality for the person in question the only loss of functionality a trans person might be giving up is ability to reproduce but if they have gender dysphoria so strong as to want to transition the idea of having biological kids likely disgusts them anyway not an expert on the subject but thats how i see it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well those things do hurt them going through a different puberty does not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean yeah obviously not a blanket solution but as good natured people i feel like we should do our best to accommodate those who have these gender issues in as safe a way as possible even if you still want to see them as girls i dont see much harm in letting them hang out and go camping with a group of friends who happen to be the opposite gender if someone chooses to surgically alter their body in any way i dont see any reason to get upset over it it doesnt affect me in any negative way and as adults theyre more than within their rights to do with their bodies as they choose again as stated before this isnt a blanket solution or blanket statement to cover all possible situations this could be attributed to this is just my opinion on the gender crisis some people go through
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant find it but a while ago there was a post on about a lady who had an implant and never experienced puberty until she finally had it removed youre right its probably super duper rare but it does happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,from here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get a biology book you a bunch here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just root for yourself youre the one that truly needs help brainwashed liberal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,care to explain whats wrong with my reasoning
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a strap on isnt a dick and a cutoff penis isnt a vagina
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you can magically grow a penisvagina ill consider you whatever you want any external modification doesnt change your biological gender
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then im sorry to break it to you but you got taught wrong they are indeed boys boys with mental illness actually no offense meant just facts for real this is not a bad word you may argue that its a boy that self identify as a girl but thats a different point as for the original post he is factually a boy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i did not the original post do not talk about gender at all it simply state that its a boy which is scientifically accurate if hes born as a boy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im pretty sure hes an attack helicopter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats just peyton manning hes not even human
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am actually
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course i do thanks for asking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre describing sex not gender and even with sex its not quite that black and white but its closer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are indeed boys yes they are thats the whole point mental illness actually it used to be considered one but was declassified as such some time back i forget which year off the top of my head
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are boys if theyre born as boys girl if theyre born as girls then you can add if they self identify as girl or boys if you wish the social science definition doesnt trump the scientific one unless precised as for the implication if being transgender is a mental illness its a very political subject wether its declassified or not dont matter much especially when looking internationally
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you posted this in the wrong subreddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,personal theory boredom leads to illicit behavior and acting out today its harder to be bored with video games tv shows movies music and the internet so readily available
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a bunch of chumps theyre missing the chance to ignore the rules of society you dont really have that opportunity once youre over eighteen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its because they dont have to physically be with their friends to be with all their friends and do most of their time alone safe in their rooms getting into internet trouble which i doubt was considered by the researchers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think its the internet think about it kids these days have access to the collective knowledge of all of humanity they can learn from the experiences of many strangers and if they say or do anything stupid their fellow internet citizens will let them know in no uncertain terms i know for me growing up getting bullied in chat rooms and stuff made me grow up real quick and these days just one askreddit thread can have more good advice in it than parents combined
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe its because we aborted all the ones that would have been terrible mostly s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,try maryland in anne arundel county those little fuckers are rotten and spoiled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,personal theory empathy is the mechanism by which people grow up and since time immemorial some people had to learn by doing to learn that shooting a living animal isnt just target practice that birds on power lines have feelings in my case i shot a bird on a wire and killed the partner of another bird they loved each other and i connected with hisher pain as it flapped around and chirped like oh my god are you ok what happened tears me up to this day now though we are constantly under the influence of a million pieces of information coming from all sources and with one fundamental difference from old networked televised information its all real life i think we learn whats right and wrong more quickly because of that not to mention the effect that this huge internetwide conversation were having about whats wrong mostly and sometimes whats right makes kids know what needs to be done to be good i dont know about everyone but the only reason i was a bad kid was because i didnt understand how to be a good kid or why it was worth it to be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the consequences for fucking up now are too much kids today have too much to lose and are told to not ruin their chances of getting in to college and getting a job its just fear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everyone knows survey data is extremely reliable especially when it comes from kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my theory on the internet if youre an asshole youre immediately shamed so you learn not to be a dick kids these days have grown up with that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id be willing to wager that its because the folks who have small kids now people in their and have watched the millennial generation come of age very recently and have decided that they should institute a little discipline and competition along with their praise and encouragement at least thats why my kids are so well behaved
UpliftingNews,not_removed,docile sheep
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this research only goes back to it might be a different story if it compared kids from now to kids from the
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be honest i dont think it was dare but the internet itself and possibly learning from the mistakes of their parents we as humans are constantly evolving and as time goes on we change our idea of what is acceptable and what isnt back then racism was common and was not shamed upon but as time went on we learned that such behavior was wrong i think the same thing is to be said about hard drugs back in the and alot of people were using hard drugs and many celebrities fell victim to it i believe that we have learned from the past and decided based on our insightful knowledge not to do such things plus marijuana use hasnt gone down because everyone who has used marijuana knows that it isnt dangerous which is why its starting to become legal in the first place edit look at the medieval days compared to now people didnt change because of schools telling kids not to burn people alive but from logical reasoning and empathy towards the human race it is through our mistakes that we discover who we are not and thus seek to change those things it was thanks to that the political leaders tried very hard to prevent another world war which caused many alliances and peace treaties to form it was thanks to that we learned that mass slaughter and nukes was completely unacceptable and consequently most of the world seeks to never cross those boundaries again except for greedy idiotic and corrupt rulers such as kim jung un
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes aside from being a bunch of sissies and fatso pokemon catchers with add i guess theyre well behaved specially because they can just silence or downvote or block whatever they dont like such as this comment back in real life of old you couldnt so you just had to deal with the bullies face on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you fucking serious kids of today are misusing freedom of speech misinterpreting secularism and fuck everything that has a hole it in pls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im gonna call bullshit take that brats phone away and youre going to see the most imbecilic short tempered fucking piece of shit that resembled a kid this side of the millennia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,useless information its not about whether they smoke or have sex its about their tiny world where they and their wants and need for instant gratification are more important than anything else they can understand if it comes down to the to stock of this nation deciding whether we feed people older than or have luxury self driving electric cars with netflix streaming old people will die
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my cents worth although i almost agree this is not accurate children today speak to their elders as if they are shit children of today doesnt know what the sun looks like because they never get outside children of today are lazy and useless children of today are narcissists and because of that believe they are better than others i am sorry but these are my observations oh and god help us if they do not get their way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol researchers epically wrong again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these kids are all brainwashed and fascinated with rappers video games starbucks and snapchat thats all they need in life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,our parents do all the fucking up for us lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also theres less lead in the air so theres that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this makes sense although the rise of things like cyber bullying is interesting i was a kid before the internet was mainstream and after so i had a childhood that existed in the old and the new with regard to the huge leap in tech we still played hide n go seek around the block and had to actually knock on the door to get a friend but there was a huge shift when things like xbox live came out and smart phones i noticed a lot of physical activities which led to mischief and doing stupid shit shifted to friends meeting online the only thing i find weird is when i went to high school most kids were chill there were cliques there was drama from time to time but for the most part everyone chilled the fuck out it was middle school that everyone was nasty i have friends and family that are both in middle school and high school and i feel like the bullying and harassment is insanely nasty with the internet its obviously easier to talk shit now and typing on your keyboard is a lot easier then talking shit to their face and i also feel with sexting and kids feeling the need to document everything it leaves major scandals and harassment wide open when i was in school you might hear that someone slept with someone else maybe someone saw at a party or the bf bragged to friends so that would get around but now nude pics and videos can get spread around so i think the dramabullying has the potential to be a lot worse today also as a woman i can tell you teenage girls gossip and talk shit like crazy i feel like in the past it was mostly word of mouth now gossiping and sniping is a lot easier as well as its documented like if a girl talks shit on someone else its just what someone else heard now people talking shit and gossiping is saved on social media or blog posts so i think the potential for toxic drama is higher today but interesting that overall people seem more well behaved i think your theory makes a lot of sense there are so many distractions and things to occupy peoples time but i still think the potential for bad behavior might be greater even if overall its down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i tend to agree with the article that its probably mostly education information about drugs cigarettes and alcohol are more readily available than ever online and real information not that ineffective scaremongering adults sometimes like to feed to teens emotionally and mentally healthy people are not selfdestructive even if they are underage and i bet a lot more things are better for teens today less bullying more acceptance better emotional support etc i think only thing that boredom leads to is being innovative and whether that innovation leads to troublemaking or not depends on these other factors
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my personal theory is that plus kids today dont really have much to rage against i mean before the teens fucking hated everything big hippie and antiestablishment movements for arguably good reasons dominated the minds of many teenagers now whats the last time you saw an honest to god protest with an actual legitimate cause ocw arguably but even that was more a something movement than a thing teens got involved in dont get me wrong kids today are still angry and have cause to be angry but in the previous few decades they were organised about it they had one or a couple big things most of them could stand against were riding the tail ends of a couple movements like feminism racial equality gay rights useless wars but theres nothing really in them to be angry about anymore its more that while theres still shitty things happening theres very little we can do about it but give it time for the next generation to come into power who we are already raising with better ideals people are kinda going with the whole transphobia thing but that seems to be having actual trouble being taken seriously by the majority of people still i mean pre i can pretty much pinpoint one thing teenagers were angry about for the previous decades but since then the biggest i can think of lately is legalising pot use and even thats not something most teens seem to be getting up in arms about my point is the teenagers today arent angry enough because they really have no organised thing to be angry at this seems to leave them mostly confused mind you i dont quite know what im saying i havent slept properly in like weeks and im drinking alcohol right now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the best time to steal a tree is years ago the second best time is now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep when i was a teen if you wanted to hang out with other teens you had to actually get together and hang out with them in person and thats when the real opportunity for real shenanigans happened now they can interact with each other even with the feeling of having a little privacy from the watchful eyes of adults online so theyre not getting up to the kind of mischief we did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kids these days have access to the collective knowledge of all of humanity i think that really sets them apart from the boomer generation as in that you can just open up google and access basically any information on any obscure thing you want
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kids these days have access to the collective knowledge of all of humanity i had high hopes for the internet as a huge library of sorts but sadly people seem to only use it consume junk and chat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikilegalizedabortionandcrimeeffect actually we did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i remember reading about that correlation in freakanomics great book
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be honest you probably anthropomorphized that bird yes animals can care about each other and humans to an extent but its not as emotional as an emotional human perceiver would make it out to be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wake up sheeple
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as compared to when punk rock and anarchism were popular amongst the youth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and teens in the and didnt kids today are much smarter than any other generation the flynn affect and misinterpreting secularism doesnt make them shit bags pretty sure there are plenty of adults misusing freedom of speech too ya know whatever the fuck that means so im not sure of thats a valid argument actually think both things you said are signs of a growing and questioning mind much rather have that then a child fearful of speaking herhis mind growing into an adult and feeling the same way also kids are more educated about sexual diseases and statistically are having less sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,take your meds grampa
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont they get some sun when they are on your lawn though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like youre enjoying life in white suburbia all right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,grandma is that you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as opposed to rockers horror movies pepsi and mtv come on gramps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rlewronggeneration
UpliftingNews,not_removed,middle school that everyone was nasty people just got too lazy to bother messing with other people ive found
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what you said is true perhaps the kids more apt to get into illicit behavior are also going more unnoticed its easier to catch kids having sex and beating each other up than it is to catch them sexting and cyber bullying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,relevant side note for the kids who do end up using drugs not the ones who party or smoke a joint every now and then kids with a drug and alcohol problem its actually becoming more and more common for them to get clean and sober while still in high school or college
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mostly s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh i give it a
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how do you know did you time travel to the smarter is a relative argument for back than they did not have the capabilities and resources we have now their cognitive development cant be any different from what we have now walking around as niche said himself the universe is ever reoccurring therefore one can state that the medium has stayed the same only the message has changed people these days are pagans bigots pigs in revolt and they try to justify it by using new vocabulary but those who like to think can see right through them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,none of those fit my categories i was raised more like books baseball blue bell and hunting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats all well and good but youre only complaining about the popular culture of the day plenty of kids are still into reading sports and hunting personally i grew up doing more fishing but plenty of kids in my highschool class of had hunting permits as soon as they could these things have just been around long enough for everyone to know exactly what they are so why waste time depicting them in popular media of course youre going to see more commercials for starbucks than a new rod and reel because everyone already knows just about everything there is to know about catching a brim starbucks is trendy everything you listed is tradition and thats fine theres room for both just like there always has been
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is one good dog
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rpupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a gallant deed indeed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,best teacher ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he lifted up a flag this is literally uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the only thing i could think of while watching this is that the assisted living facility needs to get off its ass and replace that flag its in tatters those places make so much money the head of the organization should have seen to the repair immediately barring that when this veteran showed up to hold the flagpole up on memorial day they should have run out to the local hardware store and replaced the damaged flag at least the person running that facility should be ashamed thats disrespectful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people saying he could fix it or just put it in the ground but him holding it is also a tribute to those who served and died assuming he has lost friends due to war let the guy honor them damn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i live less than miles from that nursing home and i go there a lot for work emt theres a ton of vets both living at the facility and in the community as a fellow service member this story really is uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,french guy here and first thing i thought this is so american the french media would have never reported it or maybe just laugh at or ridiculed the whole situation it is not even a government facility and sadly we also have our dead to mourn it is so strange to realize how differently the sense of duty to your nation can express itself on different sides of the atlantic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant we all just be friends at the end of the day it doesnt matter if you agree or disagree with the politics of it all or if you agree or disagree with the fact hes holding a flag what matters is that its a big deal to him and its his way of showing respect you may not like the fact that hes doing it but show some respect he and many others have given up so much to just do their jobs many of those men and women giving up their lives for that job and im sure if you asked the guy himself he would say that he wasnt just holding that flag for himself of for any of the vets in the home but for everyone especially civilians who are involved in conflict because at the end of it all no one really wants that so fair play to the guy if thats what he wants to do and if thats what he believes in more power to him and if you disagree youre completely entitled to that opinion but dont slag him off for showing that respect or doing his job because no soldier wants to go to war edit thank you kind stranger for the gift of gold greatly appreciated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did anyone else get a weirdspammy virus popup from this site i dont think its my phone doing it since all other sites seem fine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a badass great way to show his respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,til holding up a flag is a way to honor dead people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this subreddit is meant to be a place free of excessive cynicism negativity and bitterness healthy skepticism is fine under certain circumstances but toxic attitudes are not welcome here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he is not respecting the grooming standard police those mustache hairs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lesson passion and commitment transcend disability the man showed it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he needs to shave his goddamn face
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this isnt really uplifting man the us is obsessed with its military
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im guessing someone who does this must take regular breaks to go pee and hydrate right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that headline on the news report soldier holds american flag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,would he still have done it if it was in front of a long john silvers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is excellent on a side note i think a well groomed beard in uniform is also fucking excellent wish more agency policies allowed for that kind of thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while he salutes the soldiers by holding that flag i salute him thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do they not have a local hardware store or a fucking wallmart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a fine example of the miltary dont fix the problem just make a symbolic gesture
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow lots of edgy teens here with brilliant hot takes on this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how about you take to fix it and then cook them some bbq instead of something so pointless if he wanted to give back than give standing there is not honoring them its say look at me look at my meaningless sacrifice of some of my time sorry but the guy is stupid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a waste of time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not to take too much away from this because its legitimately an awesome gesture but it really irks me that he isnt holding it properly while standing at parade rest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,had it been a thunder storm it wouldve been a terrible idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jesus christ man shave your face
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like the millitary or not they still deserve our respect if they havent fought for us we would be in an hitlerian world or something like that people these days tend to forget that without the sacrifice of millions they would not have their personal computer pizza pockets and other stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a disability in my leg that makes it hard to stand for more than minutes and this guy stood for several hours big respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow the comments here are just horrible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i salute you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we lennied their website
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is this uplifting this is depressing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,perfect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a fucking cloth who the fuck cares people are too patriotic and pyscho over a damn cloth with a stick in it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,flag worship is a mental illness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,former us army here this dude seems a little stacked for just years of service several tours in iraq someone help me outcheck out in the video and tell me where the devices are on his iraq campaign medal row on the right i dont mean to be a dick i just get skeptical sometimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,couldnt just stick the flag hes holding in the ground and go enjoy his day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you just fucking quoted a book review from the christian science monitor holy shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would point you to scandinavian counties now but its pointless to argue with a brick wall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i remember a guy in my city who spent days counting every grain of sand in a playground as a tribute to the many homeless people in the area what a great soul he is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hell yeah i grew up in wilbraham its great to see it in the news for something good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the incivism is palpable watch out for all the edges people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,any redditors in that area want to coordinate a donation drop off for army specialist darren swallow andor the wingate of wilbraham rehab facility
UpliftingNews,not_removed,amazing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a stud god bless this guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is that an uplifting news someone holded a flag up oh wow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his disability must involve not shaving wtf dude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats fucking awesome kudos brother chills just watching the vid thank you immensely for your service all around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or he could have just fixed it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well done brother blue spaders
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i find this kinda corny lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nonstory patriotism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a nice gesture but its purely symbolic why not help out and fix something clean or anything tangible instead he just stands there doing nothing ill accept my downvotes now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think this may be the best tribute ive heard of for memorial day made me cry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because merica
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people sometimes do things which transcend all logic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a bunch of fucked up people in this thread
UpliftingNews,not_removed,itt alot of people with positive comments seems to be more people acting like a bunch of assholes though this was someones personal tribute to fallen american soldiers from all conflicts not a pr stunt not to call attention to the broken flagpole but to honor the dead who gave everyone in this thread the freedom to comment from either their heart or their ass people seem to quickly forget that if it wasnt for the american troops during both wws everyone would be speaking german and most likely would be executed if you arent blonde and blue eyed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you sir are awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fing hipsters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one hell of an amen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,amazing absolutely amazing that thats the news reporters real voice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is anyone else getting a virus alert visiting the link
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok obama who are you going to invite to the white house now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where did all these onions come from
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was this article written by a bot it has a very ai feel to it also who cares about this bored asshole in front of a rehab default reddits are bullshit except writing prompts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a true hero
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre brain dead sweetheart most did join to fight not for blood for patriotism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,disabled how so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill never understand the american devotion to the flag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,flags are shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i get that hes disabled but i still dont like that hes holding it in a dipped position although i guess there really isnt much of a better way to to it at rest though if hes standing there without relief for hours
UpliftingNews,not_removed,best comment in the thread
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy fucking shit youre right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my mind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he lifted up a flag this is literally uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he could have easily propped that in between the rocks to hold it up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed shameful that flag is no longer serviceable and should be burned before i catch the inevitable flak from the uniformed who will cry treason at the though of flag burning i shall direct all of you to the httpwwwlegionorgflagfaq and the httpswwwvfworgflag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those places make so much money how much would you say care facilities whether nursing homes or assisted living run profit margins of on average httpswwwpropublicaorgarticlesevenquestionstoaskwhensearchingforassistedliving in listed the industry as being the least profitable in the nation with a profit margin that year if a facility accepts medicare patients they cannot arbitrarily raise their rates they are told a set amount they can charge you could at least try to differentiate between private and nonprofit private is naturally all about filling beds beds but you cant lump nonprofit into that group
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the cynical side of me says it would end up being a chinese made flag also are there any vets that can verify this guy by uniform standards i realize the beard is because he isnt in anymore but is the rest legit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holding it is more symbolic than just fixing it for sure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,two tours in iraq im sure he knows at least one person who has passed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like facebook comments are slowely leaking into reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fixing it would be a longer lasting token of tribute then holding it for the amount of time it would take to fix it still a good guy though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holding it up in your best uniform is putting you not the flag on show he probably rang the news people too you can honour people without making it into a public display
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is he honoring them or making himself a spectacle i guess i shouldnt judge being a war veteran its impressive he hasnt killed himself yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not like he can just swallow his pride
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hell im not even a service member and this is very uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a ton of vets both living at the facility good to see people who cared for animals all their lives looked after
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh cool you probably work for either amr or the department then greetings from el
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell me where you all are and i can brin you a new american flag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know whats more uplifting than this hot air currents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think it would be more uplifting if we took care of our vets after they get home instead of sending them to unnecessary wars to kill innocent people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very true my aunt has cancer and she served almost years in the navy i wouldnt send my worst enemy to receive the care she received at the va hospitals such a shame
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a lot more frenchmen have died in wars throughout history than have us americans it only makes sense that youd see things in a different light
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah as opposed to rescued puppies and sick kids meeting celebrities which are kind of universally uplifting this highly upvoted submission is very culturespecific uplifting news ie very tied to particularities of us culture i mean in a lot of places in europe for example cause thats what im familiar with this gesture would be received in a very different way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the propaganda has been in full swing here since september and the bush years living amongst some of these people here in the us is really strange and extremely scary to say the least especially when you leave the major cities the racism is at an all time high and the tension is high evryone is angry and no one knows why just look at the overwelming support for trump the only thing i see with the blind patriotism here in the us right now is that of germany in wwii we can do no wrong and are the best in the world also we own everything and every one better get with the program kind of the same as the time of mccarthyism httpsenwikipediaorgwikimccarthyism are you aware that we hate france here there was a time when france refused to join us in the successful iraq afghanistan campaign that we in diffidence changed the food name of french fries to freedom fries in the dc capital but dont worry we hated france before that anyway hell now that i think of it the only places we love here are israel england germany v and perhaps new zealand everyone else is second and third world and basically over all can go fk themselves also dont forget without us in wwii there would be no france so you owe us forever you should see me cringe every time i see any sports where the usa is participating in where they chant usa usa its always a dick measuring event always and never ever about sportsmanship just winning i especially love how they go nuts when the womans soccer team wins the world cup an event that was made in request os the us especially when they are unaware that no other country in the world takes the womans world cup seriously and there are literally no facilities or special training for such an event in the majority of the world with an exemption to perhaps germany australia and canada just look at the cover of the game of ea fifa where the us and canada put a woman on the cover we are better then this and we have to overcome this insanity asap lets see if i get deleted for stating the obvious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the us is not all idiots but foolish patriotism and soldier worship is instilled with subtle brainwashing from a young age even smart people sometimes do it but its the idiots that shout support pur troops from the rooftops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its also completely nonpolitical to everyone except for a handful of dipshits he is a soldier holding a flag it has nothing to do with george w bush iraq obama trump or anything else
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this sub ironically has some of the most toxic comments on the entire site
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i personally think the act is a waste but to each his own i dont like the way that it was spotlighted for news though if you understand nationalism and propaganda you understand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i did as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i got it too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everybody here is up in arms about the wrong thing this mother fucker and i are in agreement flag duty there should have shaved

UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont understand he held a pole but its not about that its about him honoring his fellow vets because when you drop out of high school and you go to war for reasons you dont really understand it feels really good to know that somewhere theres a guy holding a pole for you he doesnt have to do it there are a million other ways to hold up a flagpole besides a human arm but he does it because he hopes that it gives you magic happy energy or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,would you mind explaining why you come to rupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the less time we spend doing acts such as worshiping veterans the more this country sucks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha glad im not the only one to have thought that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre going to wear your class as even if youre no longer in you are supposed to abide by regs he did a good thing but why go through all that effort to look presentable and not bother to shave
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one of the bravest acts you can do as a service member is to request a shaving waiver my balls were never that big
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was actually wondering about thatare we allowed to wear our uniform after retirement and not shave
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can understand both sides and as a civilian i dont think ive earned the right be a part of the argument i wouldnt blame vet for holding their fellow servicemen and women to the highest standard as a civilian in my eyes hes earned the right to tell his razor to go to hell if thats what makes him happy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not all of us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in your opinion why dont you just let those who want to enjoy it enjoy it this is the subreddit for uplifting things after all you sound like the kind of guy who would call out a technicality in connect four just to make a kid feel bad that he didnt actually win the game
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what country are you from that people would not find this uplifting with their own flag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh the military that saved europe during wwi and wwii and how memorial day honours the dead from all american conflicts almost all european countries celebrate or memorialize major conflicts be it victory or loss anniversary of dday liberation of holland victory in italy so many individual battles no need to be a dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,even the guards at the tomb of the unknown soldier have a latrine they can use
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its the most american thing ive seen recently
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he made the day of many many more people doing what he did rather than just fixing the flag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its possible to agree with you and also be very moved by his gesture at the same time we thank you for your comment we meaning me i of two minds shut up no you shut up lets go ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup anyone who doesnt worship the military andor a flag is an edgy teen theres no way an informed adult wouldnt worship such beautiful freedom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but then there wouldnt be a sweet propaganda pic for the internet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that and the reporter saying he was standing at attention
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hopefully there would have been lighting with that thunder storm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jesus christ take a history class or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some of us dont hate people who choose to improve themselves through the military my own grandfather enlisted because he just wanted to be able to support himself he wouldve taken a different path if he had the choice at the time however not all of us want to forcibly worship the military and demand that people recognize that recent wars somehow increased our security we civilians who recognize needless wars didnt send the soldiers to fight we didnt want them to fight and were sick of being forced to acknowledge that their sacrifices were for some greater good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if they meant several years and it just got lost in translation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty much the opposite sir i think your wrong edit sir not mam
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if hes disabled maybe hes released and therefore doesnt have to shave many guys i know grew some gnarly facial hair after getting out of the service
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems to me he was trying to make a symbolic gesture on a day that means something to him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,disabled vet who served multiple tours fuck him right nothing stands in the way of snark for you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you suggesting a one armed man should have built a new flagpole instead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but that would allow him to grandstand and draw attention to himself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why bother hes got plenty of free time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats okay you dont have to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats because you live in a shit country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,please explain yourself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,free punctuation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,writing prompts is there to get free movie ideas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its called parade rest hes doing it correctly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre so edgy woooow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we saved your ass in so say thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,comment is literally being up voted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have the feeling that this subreddit is more and more understood literally i have seen about posts of people lifting something in the last weeks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,best comment ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how are unserviceable flags destroyed the flag code suggests that when a flag has served its useful purpose it should be destroyed preferably by burning for individual citizens this should be done discreetly so the act of destruction is not perceived as a protest or desecration many american legion posts conduct disposal of unserviceable flag ceremonies on june flag day such ceremonies are particularly dignified and solemn occasions for the retirement of unserviceable flags
UpliftingNews,not_removed,used to do this each year in boy scouts it should be done respectfully and there isnt a really prescribed way of doing it and you dont have to do it if the flag brushes the ground once despite popular opinion obviously want to avoid that if you can but its after it is faded and tattered or too dirty to be presentable that it should be retired some will separate the stripes from the blue union others will do the whole flag at once sometimes like we did was separate for a big flag while explaining the ceremony for the audience and did smaller flags all at once afterwards the treason part is more in the motivation for doing it yeah its disrespectful if done in hatred but for retiring a flag its kind of like a viking funeral cremation for people can be respectful if done right same thing here we liked to fish the grommets out of the ashes and give them out to people we think would appreciate them too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok checked it out wingate is private and pretty swanky exec team could and should have attended to the poor condition of the flag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fair enough im local and its easy enough to check out i still think that if i worked there in any administration capacity id have purchased a flag with my own money its just not okay to fly a flag in that condition
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed its a way even after hes served that he can still serve his country if you know what i mean good on him though im sure a lot of older veterans would be honored to see that rather than a functional flag pole any day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,quite possibly several if hes disabled it most likely means that his unit was placed in a bad situation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im assuming that theyre not just gonna leave it broken just because hes paying tribute by holding it up for a day doesnt mean theyre not gonna fix it at some point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,isnt it better to publicly honor so people get the message youre trying to send
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or hes in uniform to honor friends and family you have died on a day dedicated to them and in honor of them he will stand there as long as possible shouldnt expect everyone is looking for minutes of fame some people are just looking to cope with losses
UpliftingNews,not_removed,guessing youve never served its a mark of respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,think about what you just said for a moment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the fact he did it for over hours at parade rest in full dress and voluntarily is what speaks volumes he could have carried on with his holiday like most of us instead he honored the vets in that assisted living facility and did something positive ps standing that long at parade rest holding a flag and in full dress is not fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who shat in your cornflakes this morning
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol not amr but another private service
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not the guy in the story i just live literally across the street its the nursing home that needs the flag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and whats more uplifting than hit air currents jet turbines
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if she has the option to move i would consider it i have had excellent va care in st louis and tucson
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikimccarthyism mccarthyism is the practice of making accusations of subversion or treason without proper regard for evidence it also means the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques especially in order to restrict dissent or political criticism the term has its origins in the period in the united states known as the second red scare lasting roughly from to and characterized by heightened political repression against communists as well as a campaign spreading fear of their influence on american institutions and of espionage by soviet agents originally coined to criticize the anticommunist pursuits of republican us senator joseph mccarthy of wisconsin mccarthyism soon took on a broader meaning describing the excesses of similar efforts the term is also now used more generally to describe reckless unsubstantiated accusations as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries during the mccarthy era thousands of americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or privateindustry panels committees and agencies the primary targets of such suspicions were government employees those in the entertainment industry educators and union activists suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence and the level of threat posed by a persons real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was often greatly exaggerated many people suffered loss of employment andor destruction of their careers some even suffered imprisonment most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned laws that were later declared unconstitutional dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable or extralegal procedures that would come into general disrepute i am a bot please contact httpswwwredditcomusergregmartinez with any questions or feedback
UpliftingNews,not_removed,word
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow we must live in different countries even though you claim to reside in the us as well your post doesnt even seem real and seems like some traipse through negative stereotypes you know that everyone uses the freedom fries thing as a joke right even in my conservative family it might be used every years as a joke no one hates france and no one takes it seriously and what sporting events do you see the usa chant done maybe there are pockets of it and im sure in some events it can happenbut its by no means something that always happens nor are international sporting events just a dick measuring event your whole post reeks of a prewritten diatribe on noncommon negative stereotypes seriously do you have one about russians being drunk and jews being moneyhungry as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pride for ones country and a sense of nationalism is not exclusive to the united states i also dont think it is a bad thing we arent witch hunting people like in the mccarthy era and we would not have our country without frances help in the revolutionary war are you ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not gonna rail about a particular political issue but you have to understand that any soldier holding any flag is inherently very political
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ummm last i checked joining the military in the us is voluntary had it been mandatory then what you are saying would make sense also the us is always at war with someone somewhere always
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obviously to find more reasons to be miserable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you gonna write the disabled vet paperwork i care more that he honored the fallen veterans by holding that flag for hours versus some reg that only applies to activeguardreserve service members
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i find it bizarre that that should even be considered a problem does it really do anything to make the act look unpresentable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,step one be black im not trying to be rude or racist but ive heard of people who got shot down because they are white also for black people ive always felt bad that shaving sucks so damn bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i a white guy got one because i have an extremely curly and thick beard that produces a lot of ingrown hairs and just generally fucks up my face if i shave every day i tried letting my beard grow for a few days always keeping my waiver in my shirt pocket when in uniform after about three days i got tired of getting nonstop shit and having to constantly pull the waiver out so i tore it up and started shaving again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nothing personal but you are incorrect even if he has a shaving profile which is next to impossible to get if you are white it must be neatly trimmed sf and seals can normally wear full beards in afghanistan and iraq but this kid aint neither one he probably isnt in the military anymore to have a beard that long or isnt at all either way he is way out of uniform which is a nogo its hard for me pat him on the ass and say way to stand there when he looks like a soggy soup sandwich
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i beat a year old in connect last weekend no technicalities needed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if someone did this in the uk theyre probably a racist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the ideology is strong with this one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,half of europe wasnt saved by the us in it was saved by the ussr which meant changing farright tyranny with years of farleft tyranny also us role in is more marginal than you probably think
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because all that wasted money could be used to fix your third world healthcare among other problems
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wouldnt he have made many days for people if the flag could continue to fly after he left
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and what do you mean just fix the flag isnt that the best case scenario here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes everyone who disagrees with you worships the military and a flag that is exactly my position well done youll do well in sociology
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes hopefully he wouldve been struck by lightning and killed because i have no idea what your motivations are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but how would you become part of the master race without soldiers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know my history what i meant by that is some people had to give their life so tyrans would not get the power over the majority of the world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who is forcing you though theres a few days out of the year where we take time to recognize the people who served in the armed forces i also dont like putting every person who served on a pedestal and trying to make them out to be a great hero and most current and exmilitary people i know dont care for it either but i would take the way we treat them now over how they were treated coming back from vietnam
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when he began people werent the spectacle was made because someone aside from this guy thought it was more noble of an act than he did initially
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was there from to pm you cuck if you would have read the article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you put the uniform on you shave your face in his case veterans must still follow the grooming standard of the time of their separation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but thats just it he did it for him i happen to have met a lot service people from being the service and all and most that i know hate these holidays because it makes them feel awkward and gives people a bs feeling like they actually did something to support troops just because they said it on facebook im also a firm believer dead dont give a shit what we do or dont do i know that will be the case for me if we really want to honor the troops i think holding the country who financed and started the whole current mess we are in responsible for their actions im looking at you saudi arabia also lets do something about those va hospitals oh yeah can we also do something about the fact it takes journey to mount doom and back just for me to possibly get a copy of my id feel real honored if all that shit happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure but part of that is him knowing that hes going to get a lot of attention for it maybe he wouldve done it if not a single person gave a shitor maybe he wouldnt have theres a lot of knee jerk rah rah murka associated with anything military whether its deserved or not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you suggesting a one armed man isnt capable of doing stuff on his own
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the whole story is absurd why wasnt the flagpole repaired if the damage occurred over the winter why is that soldiers effort not treated as a clear indicator to fix up that damn flagpole no word of any tangible consequences coming forward from his action he fought in a pointless war got crippled in the process is maimed for his life and still has the cheek to go through this essentially meaningless public stunt standing there wont solve anything i dont see the merit in it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the only problem is that he has the flag in his left hand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im fully aware what parade rest is that isnt a guidon though have you ever seen a colorguard do parade rest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh apologies from the majority of americans i promise we really arent like this person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,racist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for checking into it they could should definitely have gotten a new one they could call up the local vfw or boy scouts to help put it to rest and it would be a good way to connect with community
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree it shows a lack of concern and respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the most important thing is that the flag still represents what they think it does look up the history of carthage or byzantium and youll understand what i mean there is always another fight to find if the enemy without hasnt done you in the enemy within is almost through the landing barges at normandy needed to turn around and land in washington dc after all fdr and his cronies had basically taken everything our grandfathers had sacrificed to turn around theres a reason that fdr called stalin uncle joe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holding it if you know what i mean ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
UpliftingNews,not_removed,receiving va disability is not the same as disabled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,check the link hes not disabled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,served
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok lets see by standing in the rain the solider makes the story about himself more than the fallen comrades reflecting that is ok because a little weakness is to be expected from the other ends of a out of sort of statistic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if it was fun it wouldnt very well make headlines fellow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,national eascare
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you have one about russians being drunk and jews being moneyhungry as well you tried too hard skipped over a main point and ended with logical fallacies nice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in addition to my link i have to add that i am more about the usa then any one here that is why things like this embarrass me to hall especially the brainwashing involved i guess the biggest difference could be that i live in a large city with a diverse culture where i get to meet a variety of people and learn about a variety of cultures while perhaps you and many others like you live in rural usa where everyone and everything is just about you and the white anglo saxon america
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whilst its not exclusive to the us american exceptionalism is a well known concept
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpswwwdhsgovseesomethingsaysomething
UpliftingNews,not_removed,about the womens soccer its just that the majority of the world use universities and higher learning institutions as just that no sports are involved and hence forth no university programs promoting womans soccer or any sport really as we do here hence there is no real competition to make the sport a womans world soccer event like the world cup as we do with mens side so what i am stating is that is is an empty victory with no true competition basically winning means next to nothing in world arena
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed in we probably wouldnt have said a german veteran standing with a nazi flag was honoring his comrades
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unappreciative
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but its still an easy career option for the jocks that failed all their classes and werent good enough for sports scholarships
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is true its because many african americans will suffer from severe razor bumps from the regular shave its entirely common for them to get waivers also step two be sf
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so if you arent correctly groomed you should not put on the uniform even if you arent enlisted anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is it such a nogo you honestly believe that his facial hair is that important
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a joke i see nationalism and patriotism from other countries all the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unless its in a sporting event comon england
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well no because that wouldnt have taken discipline he was saying i will hold this flag up affixing the flag into the ground to hold it up would have been more of a government solution rather than a personal effort
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah as borders mean less and international businesses trade more we wont see as many wars peace is a symptom of economic growth not militaries i wonder if people will continue to attribute the peace in my life to soldiers fighting some war at some front line at some place we probably dont belong that said i do respect military members the majority of them surprise actually value living and dont want to fight they want to have careers support families and live like the rest of us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no one is forcing me i shouldnt have written forced i do feel pressure to not say anything against the military however as though i am somehow a fucking nut job for recognizing that lives were thrown away for literally nothing and what i said has nothing to do with slandering vietnam vets you shouldnt have brought that up in your reply
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you just get triggered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you want to be against certain wars then be against them but dont blame our servicemen and women who have no say in what our country decides to do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you are too ignorant to know that it certainly isnt the troops shaping foreign policy then i suggest you do some reading you gotta be a pretty shitty individual to see a soldier and think that its your ilk that was spitting on vietnam vets the least you could do was to empathize with a guy who wanted to serve his countryregardless of your opinion of the conflict as a whole the whole country jumped in with both feet after and a strong argument can be made for the validity of the decision to go into afghanistan but im sure you had it all figured out from the start
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think hes suggesting that blind patriotism for its own sake is unhealthy for a country way too much chest pounding and war mongering in america and posts like these contribute to that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there may be a significant jump in difficulty when it comes to installing a flagpole rather than just holding it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course not but i cant think of any way to use a post hole digger without two hands
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can honor the sacrifice our soldiers made without supporting the war as a whole maybe the fighting was ultimately wrong or unnecessary but the people and beliefs they stood for is at least deserving of some respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and if you dont see it theres no reason to continue this conversation because theres no way youll ever be reasonable about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont ugh me stuff your ughs in a sack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,against englishmen i guess yeah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you high
UpliftingNews,not_removed,army specialist darren swallow took it upon himself to stand outside the facility the veteran who is disabled following multiple tours in iraq told
UpliftingNews,not_removed,says he is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so you agree that he made a personal sacrifice to honor some veterans he likely never met and never will meet personally im proud of the guy and glad folks like him are out there in this crazy world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol probably best i dont identify myself online
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck national
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there was no real main point to his diatribe other than usa suks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i know and i remember it what im saying though is that it is an absolute shortlived joke nobody takes it seriously and its accompanied by eye rolls to even bring it up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol i interact and work with people from all over the world literally every single day typically it is by phone but occasionally in person as well i absolutely love and respect other cultures as well and honestly if i could mix and match various cultural norms i would because i am not saying the usa has the best of them by any stretch and i live in a city that has half million people so hardly a rural setting so i say all that just to show you that your assumptions probably as per usual are incorrect you sound like a teenager who has recently taken a world history class and who now considers themselves educated but mixed with plenty of angst but who knows maybe youre not but if youre driving for a point next time maybe you can actually put together something resembling a chain of related thoughts that make for a convincing argument
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whilst oh god go make me some american exceptionalism doesnt mean amerikans is better dan nebuddy else lol it means that here you have the tools and the rules to make it and be a free man it means that the way it was originally set up you can defend your life and your family with force without being prosecuted it means that federal power is distributed amongst three branches of government to provide checks and balances american exceptionalism isnt about a class race creed religion nor ethnicity its about a place where there are rules that allow a free man to live in peace or at least thats what it should have meant until fuckers started tinkering
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unappreciative of the people who allow you to be the prick you are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i get that what i dont get is how they dont understand that they most likely will be sent to a war and have their liver ripped apart ether physically or ptsd
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ba in biology here enlisted army about of the guys im here going through training with have degrees we are all enlisted several have graduate degrees i also played college sports along with or so other guys here didnt have a scholarship but many of my buddies here did so what were you basing your statement off of exactly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it bad that i wish i was sf so i could have a beard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes i am a white guy so it would have been an issue to get one although i was ce so i saw a few white dudes get the waiver they were determined as hell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,correct
UpliftingNews,not_removed,correct if you put it on you need to follow all regulations
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a civilian i could care less if shaves but i understand why those who have serviced feel they its inappropriate those who havent being in the military might see it as trivial but not kike they are pulling out rule books and looking for excuses to pick on this guy its literally one of the most basic standards so not meeting it is a big deal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,receiving an honorable discharge means hes allowed to wear his dress uniform even when no longer serving however he is still required to abide by the regulations
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre obviously not in his chain of command everybody in has multiple tours now for the most part i hate that he is disabled but that could be anything from tinnitus to sleep apnea his ability to stand still is impressive though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre right i could see this happening in north korea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,best in the world at what wasting all your money on military for no reason the us excels at nothing its a decent place to live but by no means the best places like switzerland are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your moms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,recognizing that lives were thrown away for literally nothing in war lives are almost always thrown away for nothing thats the sad truth and what i said has nothing to do with slandering vietnam vets you shouldnt have brought that up in your reply i never said you were attacking them i was simply making a connection between the atmosphere of praise for servicemen today and what it was a short time ago it wasnt meant to be a straw man argument simply pointing out that id rather over praise our servicemen than damn them for following orders as it was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im constantly triggered by morons that dont read anything and just click reply
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell that to the ss
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they do have a say in what they themselves decide to do however vietnam perhaps not but if i recall correctly thats the last time anyone was forced to go correct me if im wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,conscientious objectors is a thing aka if you have a conscience you object to things youre against yeah they dont shape foreign policy fine you still choose to serve for fucks sake you made a choice to carry out actions that you may not agree with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this has nothing to do with chest pounding youd be hard pressed to find anyone around here who thinks the war was justified what you do find is people who still find it in their hearts to feel for our injured boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe the fighting was ultimately wrong or unnecessary but the people and beliefs they stood for is at least deserving of some respect apply that same line of thinking to the fallen soldiers of isis and tell me if it still makes sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i respected them by paying taxes and getting called a traitor for voicing my opinion against the war they werent drafted so theyll get the respect that i reserve for anyone whos dead this is just another star spangled circle jerk holiday
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aah thats not fair of you to say preemptively crossing out all future chances for me ever being reasonable but does it surprise you if i can make the same claim or for that case virtually everybody who pitched in his cents in this thread ever met a person who willingly advocated or defended something unreasonable in hisher own eyes my wrong is your right and vice versa
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont ugh me stuff your ughs in a sack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope it is pretty well documented that fdr admired much of what stalin achieved he liked him and called him uncle joe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry i was totally fried yesterday thanks for correcting me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep sorry i was totally fried yesterday i was wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,personally i could do without symbolism and gestures of support that only seem to reinforce a narrative that everything is ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awe damnit guys we almost got him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey now somebodys gotta do the bariatric and dialysis transfers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no his point was that nationalism and the propaganda associated with it is as prevalent as usual in the usa noting examples of it going back to mccarthyism if you dont like the idea of nationalism via propaganda then i understand why you might read it as usa suks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im from la quite a large citycounty and i have traveled quite a bit around the world to your point putting together a chain of related thoughts would take too much time and effort and would probably be too long reddit is mostly for highlights or bullet points and such as far as my assumptions is based on the general response i got from everyone on the subject and not just yours therefore i went on the offense rather then the defense i do like your little teenager insult if you really must know i am a historian with focus on classical greek and grecoroman periods
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you honestly just attempt to call me out for using the perfectly common english word whilst baffling
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how do they allow me to be the prick i am
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its true there are tons of career options for vets you could be a garbage truck driver or a janitor or a ditch digger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oooh so your dad was in the military then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no way man if you went through all the suck they have to go through the least you should expect is to be able to grow a manly beard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for the follow up i didnt realize the grooming standards applied to wearing the uniform i guess i had assumed it was just a rule for when you were active military
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thankfully theyre getting rid of sleep apnea on the disability list this year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,didnt it say hes not in the military anymore thats probably the reason hes rocking that operator beard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry your country sucks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think he was going for finger fucking your mom asshole a comma can change everything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its just reddit getting triggered over the internet may be something you should look into getting help for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not sure but i think if they refuse they get court martialed the army spent a shit ton of money make soldiers into what they are and effectively makes them the property of the government i dont think its an option not to go i may be wrong but im pretty sure thats the case
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets try this thought exercise you are with a company right you sign a contract with them on one day some shit happens that changes the company now you can either put yourself in the group of people who didnt expect the change to happen or put yourself in the group that joined the company after the change now the company cant decide at all where it goes zero choice the heads of the company only pick who goes not where they go but instead of bitching at the people sending the company you want to complain to the it guys that you have no idea how it works arent really worth much to you and dont help you out ever the military isnt just war numb nuts look where a shit ton of medical advances of come from technology when a state of emergency is called guess who doesnt get to turn around and dip the fuck out the same people you are saying should be able to say nope when they find out they are going to war im sure thatll end well hey there is a natural disaster and they activated our national guard unit to help evacuate people and treat the injured and you want them to be able to say fuck that i dont feel like it i only like some of the perks of the military not the like risking part jesus christ
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh no seems like they chose to serve their country that is a thing being a cunt to disabled vets is also a thing conscientious objectors were against being drafted during vietnam this isnt the same thing you can have a conscience and still want to serve youre out of your depth judging by your heavy involvement in gaming youre probably a bit socially challenged which makes sense go back to your gaming subreddits
UpliftingNews,not_removed,our injured boys chose military service during a time of unjust war excluding those in service pre its actually quite understandable that many dont consider this a laudable life choice i get that some people joined because of family tradition or out of a sense of service but lets dispense with the fiction that someone is worth honoring simply because they chose to work for the government in a job that lets them kill people and blow shit up anecdote warning i personally know eight service members of those i would say that can pass as decent human beings the rest were rednecks looking to kill people legally of those decent ones only one is worthy of respect for his actions during service memorial day for me is a yearly reminder that it doesnt matter what kind of piece of shit you are so long as you are draped in an american flag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what do you want from me yes our military has made unforgivable mistakes and probably will make more yes bad people can infiltrate our military there are you satisfied do you want me to hate my country as well are you smiling if youll excuse me im going to be with my family and enjoy this beautiful weather i hope youll do the same friend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in the context im talking about us soldiers from my point of view the war was started because we decided to defend ourselves from terrorists we went into it with a protective mindset rather than a destructive one theres no honor in groups like isis they fight because theyre told to not because the situation demands it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and another remark without any sort of semblance to an argument make a point and defend it instead of sitting there and asking rhetorical questions or dont comment at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,huh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which documents should i look up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds sad and lonely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,close but no cigar im a squirrelly little bastard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how much more commonly used is whilst compared to the word while it wasnt an attempt i totally and straight up called you out for it edit while i was doing that i also called you out for being a pompous hipster blatantly context clues brah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,veterans like mr swallow here are the people who fight to make this country safe and allow you to have your freedoms that are not allowed to you in other countries you may not agree with the recent wars or the reasons we went to them but these people put their lives on the line to enable you to sleep safely in your bed and post bullshit on the internet have a little respect for what theyve done and continue to do for you instead of being an asshole
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess it depends on the branch you serve some of my family members went to the navel academy graduated as officers and finally got a job as special agents never saw any action the big thing they always mention to me was how strange it was when they would see crew men that have been in the navy or years having to salute them right after they graduated whenever they saw them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope no living family in the military
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you i like you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey i just looked at this again and was wondering were you just guessing that i went through the training or was it a general statement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre missing the point if youre going to go through the effort to wear the uniform and even though the pic is small it looks like its still setup properly then go all the way dont half ass it he doesnt need to wear the uniform at all youre right hes done enoughim not arguing that point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know i hadnt considered that either way he cant english for shit also i dont think he knows either of our moms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh stfu dont belittle me ive been on the internet longer than you have been alive maybe you should look into reading articles before you comment on them with shitty comments on a subreddit about uplifting news you wannabe troll
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they chose to join right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in the future reread your posts and make sure all your sentences make sense but for the sake of the argument lets try another thought exercise you have the option to join a company who will send you to kill people or be killed on the off chance that certain changes are made in the future are you willing to take that chance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,username reinforced
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get emmmmmm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you always make silly straw men to get worked up about no one said fuck that guy if having a flag up is so important then he should of fixed the flag pole so there will always be one up instead he stood out there to make himself feel good as a marine i can tell you this means nothing to me nor would mean anything to any marines i know this is an empty gesture which will not change anything but the feeling in this guys stomach you know those guys who drink way too much of the cooperate koolaid and always think the company is right thats how most service people feel about stuff like this there are only two truths when serving you are a commodity and you have a job to do any thing else is there to make those pills easier to swallow now please go through my comment history so you can tell others why they shouldnt listen to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems like youve been pauses to don sunglasses wicked triggered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god youre boring
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh cripes did you kill innocent people during your service if so then yeah bury your head in the sand but if not chill out and stop taking every knock on the us military as a personal attack against you and your family
UpliftingNews,not_removed,with all due respect thats an incredibly oversimplified and plain incorrect point of view on why the recent wars started goes a lot deeper than that i suggest checking out bitter lake by adam curtis to get a better understanding of the lead up to the middle eastern conflicts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not so black and white it goes further back then just we were attacked by terrorists much of the problem is how we deal with foreign policy and aside from this war what about conflicts like vietnam were they also fighting for our freedom the thing about all of this support the troops shit is that the troops do as theyre told and theyre not there to fight for our freedom theyre there to protect the power of those that have it this whole thread in general says something about the dangers of blind patriotism anyone asks why he didnt do something more practical like call someone to fix it and everyone loses their mind because you questioned the way a troop handled something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but i did make my point i expounded my original oneliner comment which might have been ambiguously phrased but i wasnt really expecting this conversation to evolve and its frankly not your place to tell me to stop posting anywhere i please
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this book might be a good place to start this cia website talks about how fdr accommodated stalin in so many respects that he ceded advantages stayed in bugged lodgings etc just look around if you really want to learn there is lots of evidence and writing on this because fdr stood in stark contrast with following us presidents and their attitude of being tough on communism as a result many historians living during the cold war period reexamined fdrs behavior and found it disturbing but at that point it wasnt clear that us and russia would enter a long period of tension and proxy wars look you seem to be a pretty reasonable person and didnt just go ballistic as soon as i criticized fdr that puts you well beyond virtually everyone else on this website i wasnt trying to be overly critical of fdr i dont believe that he was a mass murderer who never got his chance but there is lots of evidence that firmly proves the socialists of his era and likely he himself knew a good deal about the purges starvation of ukraine gulags and other soviet atrocities and liedignored them because it was inconvenient to acknowledge the results of concentrated power and human nature while at the same time they were trying to bring the us into communismlight via new deal socialist policies remember this was the era where the supreme court rightly struck down many of fdrs new deal stuff because it overreached power fdr threatened to change the makeup of the supreme court court packing plan and the four horsemen traditionallyminded justices folded and quit messing with fdr can you imagine the shitstorm that would ensue if trump or bush had mentioned doing the same thing a cornerstone of the left is hypocrisy and always will be hillary clinton would not eat dinner with the majority of the people she expects to vote for her and if youve ever been to a grocery store in the ghetto part of town and seen the armed guards walking around the parking lot you understand why i dont like them either i dont hate them but i dont trust them and carry a gun because i live in a free state and can do so without risk of the government imprisoning me for exercising my natural rights all that aside though it is no different now that it was in fdr was a rich new yorker and conned a bunch of dusk bowl country people into thinking he cared about them the president has always been blamed too much when the economy isnt good and gets too much praise when it recovers maybe a more interesting approach to this conversation would be me asking why you think fdr was a good president do you think his face should be on mt rushmore or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like this dude when the internet forgets he held a pole for a long time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope but i know him good funny guy are you a dispatcher there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whilst is used all the damn time in england you really do look a complete fool trying to call me out on that its used when the word that would follow while starts with a vowel usually and yes you did call me a hipster for using the word whilst which is patently fucking ridiculous just because you were blatant about it doesnt mean it makes any goddamn sense to be doing it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be percent clear whilst is in no way shape or form uncommon or an indication of pomposity its literally just a word people use for fucks sake
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its because of the things people do supposedly for our country that creates the problems in the first place i wonder how large a problem islamicextremists would present if the us didnt invest in distributing islamicextremist textbooks to the middle east the reason for that so people like me and you could sleep safely without fear of the russians these problems are creations of the same outfits that claim they want to solve them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,soldiers arent altruistic saints theyre poor souls who wanted to improve their own lives but were ordered to stupid shit wars and we dont need to ignore this fact by constantly assuming that their orders were executed to somehow increase our security
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that only applies to vets from and before
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like i said its a really great job for someone with otherwise no future now you can sell rifles to school shooters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so what went wrong in your life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was a general statement then after you responded i looked at your comment history and saw you posted in the seal sub ive been trying to soak up all the information i can about buds so thats why i messaged you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he has done so much he should be able to dye his hair bluewear a neck tattoo have some stylish ray ban sunglasses on and maybe even gauge his ears i meanhe earned the right to wear his uniform however the f he wants im with ya gorilla
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mr pedantic bureaucrat here who gives a shit the man has done enough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes not a very good friend of my mom considering what he suggested i do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not true and im not belittling you i just dont think its healthy to be upset as you are over an internet message board
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess killing is all the military ever does theyve never been used for relief efforts natural disasters when rioters go well beyond out of control but its fine you dont like the military there are enough volunteers that you dont have to like it but even if some horrible shit did happen i doubt you would answer the draft thats fine your personal choice if you can only view the military as a killing machine you shouldnt be in it anyways you would be deemed mentally unfit to serve i sure as hell wouldnt want someone who has the mindset that all the military does is kill watching my back while i do my medical job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually yep a couple of guys said fuck this guy and please dont go out on a limb guessing whether im worked up or not just make your point without trying to reduce mine to an emotional outburst and lastly knowing a fallacy and applying it properly are two seperate things everyone here seems to have taken half a semester of philosophy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no dude you take them off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okeydokey there you dont like it so i must be wronglying and worthless to boot thats definitely how the world works if i threw in my great uncle itd be and hed probably count towards the decent servicemen count but he died in korea before i was born i grew up in middle of fuckin nowhere pennsylvania two of my biggest tormentors during childhood were redneck pieces of shit that abused anyone on the bus smaller than them they enlisted straight out of school as did my neighbor the neighbor is a good person and joined to get away from a shitty situation at home i dont know why exactly the bullies joined but if they suddenly became worth honoring after the fact ill eat my hat which would be difficult to accomplish since i dont own a hat edit since were getting all ad hominem up in this bitch i just checked your post history who the fuck goes to porn subreddits and says terrible things to the uploaders like who appointed you grand high inquisitor of gonewild
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when the knock is made in response to things like this it is an attack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now youre getting defensive so lets go back to your original comment here what he did transcended all logic so theres no logic in wanting to memorialize your veterans theres no logic in finding out today that the flagpole is broken and wanting to remember fallen soldiers of past and possibly fallen friends to pay respects to those who lost their lives for their country but all that transcends logic more so than sitting on an online forum and shit talking the guy about what he chose to do with his time today right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everyone obviously disagrees with you here buddy sorry you have to be an asshole your whole life why dont you just block rupliftingnews cause youre not contributing anything here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont give a fuck about mt rushmore i want people to have food on their tables and clothes on their backs you fucking buffoon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think people will remember it just not nationwide whats important is he tried at a minimum we should try to improve the humanity of our fellow man anyway we can i appreciate this mans gesture and the countless others people do everyday just because
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh come now im just having a bit of fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now like i dont have any actual animosity towards you in my head though i see david tennant just throwing an absolute tantrum about the english language and some random american guy just saying hey brah theres more of us so yeah youre english is bad now it makes me feel warm youre stamping around and being short and liking terrible food just being mad about the whole thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,upvotes all around for you mate for being a good sport to be sure though it does sound a little pompous when i do it though right right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while i dont agree with a lot of the shit the commands do to say wed be safe if we just left people alone is bullshit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish more people would realize this it doesnt make you unpatriotic to fully look at things people you can still love your country and be critical of its practices
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a majority of people enlist to go fight no matter how you would like to justify it anyone enlisting after pretty much knew they were going to war also take the military away and two things happen we get overrun and a new draft is implemented so yeah these guys are protecting your ass one way or another
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why because you say so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,absolutely nothing lifes great is it possible you could just not know what youre talking about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck no the uniform is a symbol all he is doing is looking like a bag of ass and defiling that symbol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he actually does have his ears gauged though he took them out check when they do a closeup on his face
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who gives a shit plenty of folks clearly since were arguing about it on the internet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not upset i was making fun of people that use triggered as a word you are really reading like way to into this i just think its kinda bs to dog a military guy on a uplifting news subreddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hahaha holy shit just because they might do a lot more than just kill people doesnt mean you can deny the fact that they do kill people innocent civilians and unprovoked nations among those our military has killed im sorry if i tread on your heart and soul by pointing this out if people could look at our military a little more objectively perhaps they wouldnt get away with all the heinous shit they get away with and maybe its critics could spend more time recognizing it for all of these wonderful things it does
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes i most certainly hope i would be deemed unfit to serve i have zero shame in that and i dont give a flying fuck if you think i should im not going to put myself in a position where i have to kill my fellow man all because theres a different flag on his uniform thanks but no thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and please dont go out on a limb guessing whether im worked up or not just make your point without trying to reduce mine to an emotional outburst you mean like how you went out on a limb guessing that the other guy was socially challenged because hes into gaming do you not see the hypocrisy there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agree to disagree i dont know what else to say man just come off it if he actually believes what hes saying that individual soldiers cant be blamed for the us militarys decisions on a macro scale he wouldnt be offended the fact that he is apparently feeling personally convicted tells me otherwise im not trying to be high and mighty its a shame on all humanity war upon encountering other tribes of ones own species is how ants behave its what keeps us from evolving and ultimately surviving
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im getting downvoted into oblivion but dude believe it or not my karma was around twenty points lower half an hour ago when i started to clarify my point so obviously some people seem to agree or the system is simply incapable with catching up with the slew of all the new downvotes coming in per minute you see the thing is that i simply dont see anything particularly uplifting in this news piece but rather find it pretty depressing besides a sobby news article and a pat on his shoulder this soldiers action accomplished jack shit here he is having to cope with his handicap for the remainder of his life and he still steps up in his uniform now with one limb less and his attitude is like this misguided adventure in iraq might have killed hundreds of thousands might have been started on the base of an outright lie might have destabilized the entire region but somehow magically me posing here with this striped cloth will make it all better its as pointless as leaving a facebook like to a cause you support except that this guy actually got out of the house to show his determination
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in theory communism and communismlite socialism work great until they hit the cold unyielding wall of human nature and realworld implementation i want everyone to eat too from what i understand after looking at some history of countries like cuba venezuela china and the old soviet block what feeds people is a demand economy not a commissar thats just my opinion but given food prices in venezuela right now im not seeing much concrete evidence to dissuade me from the viewpoint
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what fantasy world are you living in you tried to call me out for using a word you failed i dont know why youre now bringing this weird ownership issue into things all i said was whilst is an extremely commonly used word in the uk ive never heard a single person put forward the notion that its pompous at all its just a situational word nor do i understand why youre concocting this bizarre image in your head why am i stamping why am i short and lets be fucking real here the us cant throw any stones when it comes to the quality of food ps david tennant is scottish you cretin if this is some crap attempt at trolling you need to try harder or not at all generally fucking off would do fine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good because thats not what i said
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can be critical of the countrys practices without talking down about the soldiers who are ordered to fight i consider myself very patriotic i love my country and i support our troops but i do vehemently disagree with the wars we are fighting and the reasons they began
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you probably never looked at the military from a young person applicants perspective economic downturn rising tuition job market going to pieces yeah the majority totally enlisted to fight a deadly war they dont value their lives at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some people joined for paid college tuition and a stepping stone to civilian professions not everyone has the means to up and out to another town where they can simply follow their dreams of course i dont think the military is the best path to meeting your goals but its entirely rational for an individual to take advantage of that opportunity especially if theyre being forced into paying taxes anyway and nowhere did i argue for abolishing militaries or other forms of security idiot edit also fuck you for assuming that most military members join to fight as though there are actual wars to be fought right now they arent blood thirsty idiots do you think the military would feature the gi bill and tuition assistance programs if they thought applicants didnt want an actual life beyond shooting guns and spending year after year on ships jerk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fighting dah bad guys for a living of course lifes great
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was joking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah people shouldnt be shitting on this dude he didnt do anything to them people are assholes and will look for any excuse to shit on somebody no matter what doesnt matter to them im sure they are very pleasant in real life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i know the military has done bad shit trust me im just tired of asshats like you who think all the military does is kill ever hear about the number of hospitals we built in iraq of afghanistan or how about when a bad guy shoots a kid how hard i have to work just to get the military to take said kid because the us government says we dont have to treat that kid no the military isnt the best thing in the world but it isnt some mindless killing machine that just kicks in a door and sprays down everything inside i went to a shit ton of villages in afghanistan and almost all of them loved the us i saw times village elders guys who looked like they were try and beat taliban guys we had arrested with their canes taliban likes to rule via killing and torturing but of course the news doesnt show the tears of the elders the thanks of villages after being able to live in fear ibuprofen shit we can get fucking anywhere i was doing medical care in a village and handed some out came back a week later they thought i was a fucking god running up to me screaming doctor doctor doctor some ace bandages and ibuprofen helped with recent and old injuries i dont want a fucking parade or a thank you for being in the military i did my job did the best i could do tried to save as many lives as possible all i ask is this herd mentality to stop everyone in the military is a killing machine everyone who wants bernie to win is a communist everyone who wants trump to win is a racist everyone who votes for hillary is an idiot why why deal with absolutes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats funny you have no problem with people who kill kids for going to school or dont have an issue with people who cut heads off reporters or people who use chemical weapons in roadside bombs or people who force kids to cut the heads off of innocent people your problem is with the people who go to find those people yea im willing to bet where injustice in the world exists regardless of country the most you will do is a hashtag for a few days or a week and thatll be it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i think i can live with that judgement as long as the rest sinks in everyone is a hypocrite but a bit more went into it than just the fact that he games
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it doesnt just come up if you arent subscribed or searching the subreddit purposefully also hau inglesh gud fer beeginarz
UpliftingNews,not_removed,were not just talking about how the war in iraqafghanistan started nor are we talking about politics memorial day is about those who have died and honoring them for giving their lives the fact of the matter is people have died probably some of his friends and hes doing something to respect those people thats why its uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are going to mess this young man up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh please this reeks of some tumblrina making up a story on her fb where she can be the brave progressive person against the unenlightened blech
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey men can wear tutus whenever the fuck they want a year old though i dont know
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a son who wanted his room painted hot pink when he was a bit older than that he liked the color pink to this day he wears pink shirts and owns a pair of pink pants they both make him look preppie as hell another son wanted a doll he got the doll if tutus were a thing back then the way they are now they probably would have sported them who cares did i wonder if my sons were gay who cares edit people judge others all the time shouldnt we be the ultimate authority live your life as your own best expert
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wtf dont make political statements with your children you know damned well a boy wearing a tutu is going to be ridiculed why would you subject them to that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its equivalent to munchausen by proxy but instead of poisoning their kids for attention from an er they force extreme progressive things on them in order to fish for intolerant people so they can get that sweet self righteous victim rush
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why would you subject them to that cause youre a bored fat pinkhaired housewife desperate for fb attention
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no idea what those acronyms mean or what that score is supposed to represent and the article doesnt even bother to explain it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,misleading title did she get a cgpa after dying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this article may help
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a nice guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,easier to put away that tarp than one of those silly inflatable pools in my experience
UpliftingNews,not_removed,give arredondo some gold
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seeing an rupliftingnews post with a worldstarhiphop video as the source rare af
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was pretty crazy given the circumstances the cop was incredibly calm he fought back the encroaching flames on both sides as they were getting closer to the occupant he first tries the passenger side rear door then moves to trunk then tries the busted drivers side door and pulls the dude out props
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im just amazed the cop was able to do that many cartwheels after saving the guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they should make a tv show out of stuff like this they could call it cops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its really nice to see the body cams showing the police in a good light i was really hoping that this would happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like how he has the presence of mind to kill the siren
UpliftingNews,not_removed,body cam shows cop oh no save passenger trapped in a burning suv alright worldstarhiphopcom oh no rupliftingnews hurray what a whirlwind of emotions and i havent even watched the video yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did the driver die on impact or was the guy hanging out the window the driver
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youtube link
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did this once last september the balls on this guy at that point its painful just to be feet away from that fire well done brother
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats in athens ga my town awesome to see our police doing good things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,huh this may be the first time i have seen a worldstarhiphop video actually hosted on worldstarthiphopcom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was that a small explosion right after he pulled the guy out if so that was close
UpliftingNews,not_removed,will have to watch the video when im on wifi here is a story as a child of we had a sedan filled with people max occupancy of on a cross province trip we had a rollover my older brother crawls out the rear window hears me panic and looks in and pulls me out he is calm as fuck and im bawling my eyes out and just panicking barefoot in the snow like many comments have said its easy to say you would do something different from a safe point of view the officer had to act fast and was likely trying to pick the safest vantage point if the drivers side door was busted i would likely try the passenger door as well another anecdote as a man of i witnessed an individual run a red light get clipped and flip over first thing i did was look in to turn the vehicle off and whip out my pocket knife in case the seatbelt was inaccessible most of the responders there before me didnt think of turning the vehicle off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not that it really needs saying after this video buuuut just wanted to point out that cops get a lot of shit not just a in the media either every fucking day from the people they are trying to help cops are people too some of them do terrible things some of them are fucking amazing human beings case and point related story i have severe depression and im doing much much better now i have been to the hospital after self harming i called the myself in a panic they asked me where the knife was i told them they said to put it on the coffee table when the cops arrived they asked about the knife and i told them it was on the coffee table just like they operator had instructed point of the story its also important to remember that cops have to keep their own safty in mind as well be as cooperative and calm as you can when dealing with them and you will almost always a receive whatever help you need quicker b have a much better experience with cops in general ive known people in the mental health world who talk about how they tried to fight off cops during mental health arrests while i do sympathize with the mentally ill people obviously i also understand that cops have to do their job and keep themselves safe at the same time tldr being a cop is hard be nice to cops edit just the grammatical errors that were to annoying to leavei left the rest deal with it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know there are some bad cops out there but when i hear blm insinuate that police are mostly racist thugs i think of stuff like this cops do an incredibly difficult and dangerous job and the vast majority of them are good people trying to do the best they can for their communities
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there needs to be more of this we need to expose a light onto the fact that we are currently generalizing police all policemenwomen arent racist killers some are but guess what these people exist outside of the police force these people arent always policemen theyre dads husbands teachers coworkers and thats fucking scary we cant just talk about brutality amongst the police force it has to go deeper than that we need to address this kind of behavior from a higher level find out why it happens to individuals and then address the issue focusing on police is restricting us from seeing the big picture
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cop shows are going to be so much more exciting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,see these are great make them mandatory for every cop in the us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there should be more body cam videos of cops doing good stuff in their jobsnot just all the negative crap that the media seems to focus on i bet theres way more good they do than baddespite how the media sensationalizes the badcontroversial
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a lot of cops are good people who joined up hopes to help and protect people good on this guy amazing how calm he seems i wish more people understood than you can be procop and anti police brutality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bodycams are a good idea people need to see that cops have a difficult job and they do some really good things i think it also would deter bad cops from committing crimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,came in to find anti cop and sarcastic video cam comments i wasnt disappointed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great to see this we see so many bad cop situations and dont see that them helping people more often than not wife is first responder and works with cops all day long she has nothing but good experiences with one exception one guy was just a dick thats one out of hundreds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bodycams dont only allow us to catch the villains they let us celebrate the heroes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish we could nominate this cop for a commendation i almost wanna ask about making a donation to their pension fund for this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the internet needs more of this to offset the negative publicity police officers receive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,avientame compa a la verga classic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this cop is a hero but i just have a question how did the guy get jammed in the window couldnt he have just opened the door and climbed out whats preventing him from doing this not trying to be a dick just genuinely curious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,truly this cop is amazing the situation implies that panicking can cause more harm but this cop like a superman i hope every cop in the world is like this our cops here are mostly late when accidents happen they usually arrived when everybodys dead very sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im kind of disappointed in the people who knew the guy was in the car help them cars dont blow up like they do in movies thank god that office showed up when he did any later and it could have been bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,omg this footage is all over nbc and cnn and every major station kudos nope
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hoping for the best that the driver died on impact or at least was unconscious so he didnt have to feel being burn alive speedy recovery to the passenger and kudos to the police officers who got there fast and sprang into action
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a goddamn hero this is the type of shit i like to see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah bodycams also show what good cops are up to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is why dont fuck around on the fucking roads
UpliftingNews,not_removed,say what you want about the men and women of law enforcement no one else is coming to save you if you are in that situation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its just kind of funny that they only mention races when something bad happens
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow i am sweating after watching that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy crap that guy is awesome side note now would be a good time for body cam companies to start advertising industrial mounting clips
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was fucking terrifying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the other person in the vehicle was burned to death this was lucky day for that guy and good effort by the cop though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i keep forgetting to put a fire extinguisher in my car
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how did he get him out its hard to see did he pull him from that tiny ass window space
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good on him nice to see some uplifting stuff for a change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really hope that becomes a norm we need bodycams to hold cops accountable for atrocious behavior but we could sure use them to commend cops when they are amazing toward other citizens
UpliftingNews,not_removed,body cam shows cop oh boy here we go again save passanger trapped in suv what a nice surprise always nice to hear news like this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow this was in athens ga so glad to see the local police doing such a good job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a brave officer wheres the round the clock news coverage on this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,finally a good cop video 😄
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah bodycams also show what good cops are up to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats insane the thing blew up at the end right what a legend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,check the comments on wshh thats his job now his body cam works lol jesus christ my advice is do not get a job as a police officer it isnt a shit job with everyone hating you its the shit job with everyone hating you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,git er done
UpliftingNews,not_removed,woah thats in my town never even knew about this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,less shaky than bourne
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this was stressful to watch i cant imagine actually being there as this was going down holy crap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn that police officer gone in like a baoss only with tshirt on he should get a medal for that or at least huge props
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a fucking hero if ive even seen one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey thats right by my house i knew i recognized those roads
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good thing he killed the siren all that stress and responsibility disturbed by constant noise it would have been harder
UpliftingNews,not_removed,time lucky listening for the address
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and i am over here complaining about how hot my hand gets when grilling hamburgers much respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this looks like a beautiful painting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and that is how you win cop of the year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,looks like most of the shots in the new jason bourne movie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man that has almost as much shaky cam as a bourne movie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that dude hit it out of the park
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so crash
UpliftingNews,not_removed,imagine how blm reacts to this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why did the passenger choose that window out of all of his options
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i saw that he got into his trunk for the fire extinguisher it got me wondering why dont police units carry some kind of small oxygen mask or something of the sort in the trunk as well this officer got to the fire scene well before the fire department and while this fire wasnt bad enough to warrant a mask for the officer surely there are other times when officers get to a fire scene big enough to need a mask before the fire department or no
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well yeah if he hadnt saved him he would have turned black
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hard core
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i though all white police officers were racists worldstarhiphop is a predominantly black web page and they are showing a white officer save either a hispanic black or mixed guy so much for blm just shows how ignorant that community is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we need more body cams
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they should equip larger policerescue vehicles with maybe something like efficient some places might already be doing similar things even a few seconds of foam time would probably be enough to pull people from some burning wrecks could also totally extinguish smaller fires a few burning tires etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,world star
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this this is the majority of cops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all i know is that almost every punk who pisses and moans about cops would never have the stones to run towards danger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow that was an intense watch nice work to the cop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its more amazing to me that a video on worldstar is about a cop saving someone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a cop doing something heroic and being admired for it on reddit it must be opposite day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always figured that body cams would be primarily used for police accountability but i had never considered the excellent pr machines they would end up good on this cop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,meanwhile blm is still trying to kill all cops because da white men
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but obama and hillary told us that police officers are racist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you wont hear about this on the mainstream media news outlets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was half expecting to see a half naked molotto woman twerking at the end of the video like every other world star hip hop post
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the cop is probably really a racist but who has problems of his own like an ailing dad and is really just a part of this difficult tapestry of modern life where all our stories are interconnected and meaningful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i realize the driver died but i wanted to know whether she perished by the time he arrived because she clearly looked to be in the most danger and was completely pinned against the steering wheel with closer proximity to the encroaching fire great rescue though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,body cams are going to be proof of the heroic actions officers make on a daily basis that always go unrecognized or unnoticed soon enough youll start seeing heroic acts for every misdeed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is why i subscribe to this sub this exact reason right here its so easy to forget just how much good is done every single day by police officers every group will have bad eggs and its important to address those but its equally if not more so important to recognize that the good far outweighs the bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just so everyone is aware you should not put a garden hose or any water on a fuel fire unless it is a foam the water displaces the fire out further but doesnt remove the oxygen so makes it harder to fight and most likely more dangerous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,see people dont care about the of cops that do the right thing they only care about the tiny few that do the wrong thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a cop saving an african american but how are we suppose to cry racism now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for posting this op as exle myself especially these days people need to see this to know that there are good cops out there who will risk life and limb to protect you because they believe in what they are doing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats pretty awesome i wish there was a show on tv that was nothing but this kind of stuff where cops firefighters and paramedics went around saving peoples lives there are dramas sure but nothing real at least nothing that i can find everyone please remember that theres like bad cops out there and good cops dont let the faux news agencies try to convince you otherwise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this must be fake since cops just shoots people point blank s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is there a subreddit for cop bodycams
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dad a
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this blue and orange contrast looks like a sci fi movie poster
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dan whitney larry the life saving guy git er out of the suv
UpliftingNews,not_removed,relevant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck this sub youre a bunch of cunts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone posted a video awhile back of the cops actually shooting and killing a guy who tried to pull a gun on them outside of an applebees reddit rallied behind those cops body cameras are good and lethal force is fine if it can proved that it was necessary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so the theory here you blamed the entire police force because a few bad cops whats the different people profiling the blacks for automatically gang banger same concept
UpliftingNews,not_removed,save yourself the lurking reddit is not what it used to be it has become a forum for ill writing closed minded users who have no facts and purely project their opinions on subjects like these i miss the fact slinging debate reddit posts once were
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so how did he pull him out too much camera shake it looked like he smashed the window but i dont know about the slide back in part
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well done copper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hell yeah props to the bravery and temerity of that officer thinking quick on his feet and tackling the situation i hope these cameras keep becoming more prevalent so we can bear witness to more heroics a news article is nice but a picture is worth a thousand words
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is reverse worldstar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good cop doing a good job could have left the flashlight behind though im pretty sure the brightly burning car provided enough light
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there goes my herowatch him as he goes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lmao worldstar link
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpwwwwspwagovaboutdocsmeritawardpdf i found that list looking for a specific incident i remember when a state trooper and a local deputy found a drunk driver pinned in his burning vehicle early in the morning they couldnt get him out and so they held a piece of sheet metal across the windshield shielding him for the fire in the engine compartment until the fire department could arrive eventually the firewall gave way and the man burned alive both cops received second and third degree burns past their elbows as well as burns on their faces and necks but they didnt let go until the passenger compartment was fully engulfed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,body cams are going to show more hero cops than bad ones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just goes to show that cops are heroes bless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,looks like neil degrasse tyson
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we need a rherocops to share the polices good deeds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,am i free to go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh yea cops are the problem people need to get a fucking grip
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that made me cry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant be the only one that saw and clicked the mia khalifa twerk video that showed up that uplifted something for sure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awesome dude is based my question though is why this guy does this heroic deed and it involves a fiery car crash and his camera records it all and is fine but when a cop does something terrible in much better environmental conditions their camera always happens to break or the footage is lost s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,may be a silly opinion but i was really happy that he didnt change his haste of actions after the guy made it apparent he was a nonenglish speaker removed man from fire replaced with racism and the crooked cop persona
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you mean a youtube video why did i have to give worldstar my eyeballs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my thoughts exactly fam
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i look forward to every officer wearing a body camera so we can get more videos of officers acting heroically
UpliftingNews,not_removed,given the circumstances the cop was incredibly calm a sign of good training
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well he was happy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea those body cameras really do have a hard time staying on someone needs to rethink the clip that holds them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,learned it from the somersault cop from texas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there actually was a show like cops that was called police pov and all the cops had body cams it was pretty cool not sure if its still airing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,once hes recovered please ask him to do an ama good publicity in the current environment for le is tough to come by
UpliftingNews,not_removed,buy him a beer for us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you guys in athens that looked like north ave at the beginning of the video
UpliftingNews,not_removed,please highfive him for us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,guy sounds pretty awesome i know if i did it id be bragging about it for months the fact that hes humble about it too gets him some bonus points
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell your buddy hes hard as nails
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the article says that the driver died in the accident but it looks as though the only occupant was the person that was saved could you clarify if you dont mind more importantly a big thanks to him and yourself as well for putting his life on the line
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope he never forgets that hes a hero
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup body cams will show heroes for heroes and crooks for crooks love it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats the beauty of the body cam not only does it help prevent misconduct but also lets us capture any cool funny or heartwarming moments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its really nice to see the body cams showing the police in a good light on worldstar no less
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there should be a subreddit for that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its always nice to see cops going beyond the call of duty to help people but then again this is what most people expect of police officers when a police officer abuses hisher power is definitely a lot more news worthy imo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think body cameras are going to end up helping the police more and making citizens look like the assholes that they truly are mandatory body cameras are going to make bad cops behave better but i have a feeling the armed populace will still be a bunch of turds look at this video these are people that day and day out run up to disastrous accident scenes people burning alive dead children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its actually nice to see the body cams showing the police in any light and not malfunctioning
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the vast majority of bodycam videos will show cops using great judgement and ethical behaviorunless they are cherry picked for political reasons the fact your first thought was that it may show a cop in a negative light proves that the propaganda has been effective that being said we still have a long way to go before policing society is deemed fair for all but until certain groups stop being adversarial and non helpful to police especially in neighborhoods with high crimes rates that wont happen anytime soon the onus of change lies in the hands of the oppressed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the firelight really was a nice light
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are part of the problem you eat up media so much that youre primed to expect piles of negative footage in reality cops that blatantly behave illegally that it would be shown on body cams are part of an extreme minority you hoped this would happen but a majority of all body cam footage will show cops in a good light not the other way around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh look another person with a play on the word faux hello friend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dunno the lighting was kinda bad the fire was too bright and everything else was too dark
UpliftingNews,not_removed,imagine trying to save a body over that loud ass noise he ended up yelling to a neighbor for a hose or fire extinguisher
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as an emt trust me you make the mistake of leaving the siren on at a scene maybe once or twice it only takes those few times to realize why you need to shut that shit off asap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,description says driver burned to death horrible way to go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,driver burned to death cop then saved this passenger from also burning to death
UpliftingNews,not_removed,driver died passenger lived heat could be felt from away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for a proper link
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his fingers probably have degree burns
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah that was a surreal experience as i recognized north ave from the video
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice im moving to ga next week i hope the cops are as good where ill be living
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was wondering where this was then heard the address and saw him going down north ave past my old apartment and was likehuh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,worldstar use to do a lot more hosting until they got in trouble for blatantly ripping off videos from youtube and other sites and reuploading them to their video playerservers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,according to it was a small explosion under the hood and the backseat was engulfed minutes later
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the impact of the accident had bent the frame and all the doors were jammed shut so whitney bent the door frame back enough to pull the man through the small rear window as he was doing this an explosion from under the hood knocked off his hat and bodyworn camera
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think that was the sound of the mic hitting the ground as he pulled the guy out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,int if the drivers side door was busted i would likely try the passenger door as well ill have to remember that one i live on a dark country highwaylong lonesome and east of omaha techically and have had occasions where i needed to help out in accidents of those the car was still running but my first thought wasnt to turn off the cars also maybe should put a knife in my car as that would have helped in the rollover incident shit a flashlight too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rgoodcopfreedonut
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rprotectandserve is a decent one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the heat was unbearable from feet away wow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hero stories dont sell in the news thats the main reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,literally less then of police ever even kill anyone any giving year of cops plus go there whole careers with out having to use a gun on duty but lets categorize all cops in with the s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when you do your job right it isnt noticed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there doesnt need to be more of this nice cops that do their job are not a problem society needs to correct nor does anyone think all cops are evil a single cop in each department who treats black or latino people differently is a problem that needs addressing what problem does this seeing more nice cops solve white fragility
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and make it impossible to disable the camera or have the footage somehow become unrecoverable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jajajaja am i doing this right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hahaha as soon as i heard that i kinda laugh a little mexicans have such a way with words lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think youre being a dick im wondering the same thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,door was probably jammed had a friend in hs whos car got a couple dings the first one caused the driver door and back to not open and after the last one non of his doors opened and had to use the sunroof
UpliftingNews,not_removed,um firefighters literally do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont blame you i work with him and i didnt find out until it was on fox five news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that would require them to get out from behind their keyboard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but like how do you think the firefighters put it out given its more water its still going to help for the time needed to get the guy out source i is firefighter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not all of that is gas and oil though its a lot of burning plastic as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,water would be fine there while there may be oilgas it will disburse heavily if a hose hits it since the car isnt running the gas pump should be off already and not adding fuel to the fire when i was our local fire department had a fire fighting course where we learned about fires and how to deal with preventing fighting fires on the last day of the course they lighted up this oilgas mixture floating on a water tank and made us put it out using one of the smaller hoses on the firetruck using a fine spray almost mist but not quite i managed to put out the fire which had prob feet high flames in under a minute using only water yes it was more fun than i imagined it would be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i see what you did there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,considering the progress of the flames and smoke the driver was likely already dead possibly from the crash itself but more likely knocked unconscious and then died due to asphyxiation the man in the back only escaped asphyxiation by getting his head out the window enough to breathe he would definitely have died from being burned as he could still breathe which is awful being cooked is a horrendous fate fires are usually merciful in that they smother you long before that can happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well yeah the misdeeds only take place when the cams dont work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah rbodycam
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont like uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if bodycamera footage legislation passes nationally requiring police to hand over data in all cases such transparency will inevitably restore the publics faith in police the more transparency the better as it is bodycams guncams are being embraced by police departments across the country even without legislation requiring them as they act as a great alibi and keep our best officers from being wrongly prosecuted when they carry out their duty though it should be pointed out that with more cops wearing bodycameras the statistical trend is actually that those with cameras are more likely to engage in fatal shootings in fact those with cameras are three times more likely to shoot an armed suspect which is good frankly having armed criminals running around is a bad thing the more armed criminals which get shot the better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,too much camera shake well the cameraman was ablaze
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he busted the window and then bent the entire door frame
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets just celebrate this for what it is a good moment in humanity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,first time ive seen a bodycam in its entirety because you arent looking literally just youtube police body cam and youll find plenty of examples
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can you please provide a video where the officers body camera fell off and there was not a physical altercation i want to see a video where the officers used a taser or shoots somebody and the camera just magically falls off as you are suggesting i have rode with cops as i did a ride in and i witnessed first hand how easily those things fall off while the bad guy is resisting arrest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this comment irks me the cop is a good guy yet we have to bring some shit into it he is an amazing human being simply that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty sure that was a hispanic man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just wish the news would play these instead of shitting all over them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i expect a lot more mundane footage of routine traffic stops and that jazz
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or possibly a person who handles emergencies well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed and from what i hear some officers are beginning to become fearful of acting on certain situations out of fear that if it goes badly that they will be the next cop on the news that people are hating on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wooorllld starrrrr
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought it did a pretty good job of staying on the officer was able to break a window with the fire extinguisher and attempt to rip a door off its hinges without the camera being moved out of position
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the way they are in utah is they get put on the inside of the shirt and have the lens replace a button or they have a faceglasses mounted camera
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think the point is that the clips are not good you dont want to be held back by your body camera when you need to run after someone better have it get ripped of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think he goes by barrel roll cop from texas but lets not split hairs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no they mysteriously lost all the remaining footage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,spend your money and give random internet strangers credit lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,will do thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hmm ive been told there was more than one person its that or he died in the hospital im off these next couple of days and cant get to the report to verify im sure by the time i work again you wont be as interested sorry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and thats why real cops arent against them they drastically reduced complaints against police in one case study too it really is a winwin when done properly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now we just need our politicians to wear body cams to find out of them are crooks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are there times when breaking the rules is the right thing to do is it possible that a good cop might occasionally do something that if caught on camera would result in disciplinary action would you volunteer to wear a body cam at your job does that mean youre a bad employee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh i think its tough on the cops you are really only going to be punished for bodycam video the best outcome of this video is a public service medal or something for the cop involved maybe a commendation the worst outcome is he loses his job and livelihood its still somewhat of a raw deal for the cop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not cops but rreverseanimalrescue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its easy to get the country riled up over a dozen cops fucking up around black people rather than comparing them to the thousands upon thousands of cops that do their jobs with no problems edit tried to phrase it better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the onus of change lies in the hands of the oppressed this is absolute fucking horse shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love how you admit cops are oppressing people and yet still blame the victims for being oppressed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,certain groups stop being adversarial he onus of change lies in the hands of the oppressed the cognitive dissonance here is strong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe if oppressed people were cooperative with their oppressors they wouldnt be oppressed get the fuck out of here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or just imagine listening to a video with a constant siren
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its also scientifically proven that humans think better with less noise imagine your driving in a car bumping some music but you cant find the address youre looking for what do you do turn down the music its instinctual and he probably just did it without thinking twice a high stress situation like that calls for those sirens to be off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,imagine being the other guy trapped watching your friend burn knowing that if you dont get out it is you next
UpliftingNews,not_removed,deleted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i heard the passenger scream papa man i cant imagine the pain i would be in if i lost my dad like that like fuck man or the ine time i got in an accident if my dad responded to a call where i was dead man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fire is the worst way to go even if you survive it is usually not fun for the rest of your life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a post is not worthy of rupliftingnews if it doesnt involve death cancer or a sick or dead animal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,worth it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,super nice if you say yes sir or maam youll never have a problem i am white but i have many black friends in the area and i havent heard anything bad shit a year ago in atlanta a homeless guy pulled a knife on an apd officer and she shot him in the leg atlanta and the areas around it are too busy to hate i regularly see police changing tires and rolling through my apt complex to make sure everything is okay shit after someone broke in my house i had a cop in my apartmentthat reeked of weed calmly take down my info and then to top if off they caught the fucker
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats nuts man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a youtube video embedded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was actually an explosion in the engine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,always have a basic car kit knife flashlight wool blanket duct tape jumper cables first aid kit granola bars spare tire and jack my family got stuck in a snowstorm once and used a flashlight to signal to another car
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because we like being angry over being happy especially when its something we think affects us negatively like politics vs something positive that doesnt this vid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,close be sure to add the upside down ¿ ¿lo estoy aciendo bien
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hahah even under those circumstances his way with words didnt make it seem like he knew the danger he was in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,completely agree ive read of road accidents are human error
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what you describe reminds me of a terribly tragic fire that occurred in chicago back in the most of the children that perished probably suffocated from the smoke long before they were consumed by the intense flames httpsenwikipediaorgwikiourladyoftheangelsschoolfire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats why the leos should not be able to disable them or have any access to the storage of that footage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for those interested heres an example of one of several sources for the conclusion drawn by op in the latter part of their statement here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn thats awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,after breaking the window he bent the window frame separating the small window where the passenger is stuck and the main window still an awesome act of heroism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,either way lets show this to colin kaepernick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know why you think they havent shown this on the news a quick google search shows that and have the video and an article on it on their sites im sure they broadcast it on cable too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,both are vital
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because the news is forcing cops to be dickheads right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they can easily censor that information before releasing the videos ive seen one where the inside of the home of a neighbor was visible and they simply censored it when it came into view there are people paid fulltime to listen to all your tv shows and make sure no one says fuck or shit in them surely they can find someone to censor personal information from body cams
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is a ridiculous reason likely used as a scapegoat for other reasons cost fear of more shootings recorded change the government collects tons of sensitive information that is confidential but has a duty to disclose under freedom of information act requests but redacts this sensitive information the same exact thing happened when there was a push to put cameras in every cop car and now it is just standard and they are always recording
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bullshit find me one department that isnt giving officers discretion in these cases
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why not both
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you mean the opposite of the guy on the phone that just kept yelling oh man looks like its gonna explode things gonna explode i think theres someone in it but im not getting near that thing its gonna explode
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i drive around i domy best to think of when then scenarios if x happens then i will do y it lays a blue print out in your head so when it happens youll have something to work off of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea but as soon as he hit the ground it came off that is exactly what would happen if he was taking down a perp see alton sterling body cams
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fair enough they get a lot of criticism thoughbasically people insinuating that the cops purposely remove them when there is a confrontation i remember when the alton sterling shooting happened the pd said there wasnt much on the cameras because they fell off people were calling it a cover up even though you could clearly see from the cell phone footage that they did in fact fall off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah and it was crazy because it was only footage from departments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was he injured from the fire i watched the video and couldnt tell if he got hurt or not if so hope he gets well soon and we all owe him a beer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there just needs to be a universally applied federal law for all state police to comply with body camera requirements cops should not be allowed to shut them off or tamper with them in any way or face criminal prosecution that would keep the good ones looking good and the crooks in the soup kitchen badgeless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there was a post in rbestof a few months ago where a cop outlined the potential negative side of mandatory body cams they remove officers discretion from the equation ever been let off with a warning been ticketed for less than the amount you were actually speeding if a supervisor reviews body cam footage and sees that happening the officer could be facing suspension or termination
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they drastically reduced complaints against police in one case study too and ill bet that has everything to do with the fact that the cops know they are being recorded funny how that works
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the best is what ny does keep the video a secret from the claimants lawyers until they invest significant time and effort in a false suit then drop the bombshell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now this is something i can get behind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we need body cams to know that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive always liked the idea of them having to wear sponsor logos on their suits like nascar does then at least wed know whos buying them off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wonderful idea id like to hear how often they all say fuck the constitution in private and then make speeches about the oath they swore too bad the only people who could make that law are politicians
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have seen some cops who have said that wearing body cameras will make it more difficult for them to let people off with a warning that is probably true but in my opinion cameras are still worth it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you argument doesnt hold water police officers are provided with lethal weapons and the legal authority to use them therefore they must behave at a higher standard than your average desk jockey given the numerous almost endless accounts of police officers abusing their power body cameras are a pretty logical result the way the system is designed now there is a lot of pressure to protect bad cops if every police officer has a body camera you can simply use the footage to remove people who are not fit to serve i really dont see why anyone would object to this if we want more effective more honest law enforcement body cameras are a pretty clear path to improving things it wont solve all of our problems but it is at least a step in the right direction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the thing is cops have a special role they can change peoples lives that power demands accountability cameras are a good thing cops with good intent will welcome them bad cops wont simple as
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good you shouldnt take the job unless youre willing to uphold the law if you think not upholding the law shouldnt wind up with you getting a raw deal well then youre basically a criminal if youre doing the job like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a dozen cops fucking up around black people you think its only a dozen cops oo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then with luck these body cams will show much more of cops not being dicks and help regain public trust
UpliftingNews,not_removed,using justified force on black people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,almost a million cops interacting all day every day we have hundreds of millions of interactions with cops and of those at most are at best controversial though l grant that the south carolina killing of scott was a murder by a police officer and the minnesota killing of castille was a travesty one that i sincerely believe was due to panic but that i cannot prove
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about the dozen cops killed by a single black lives matter activist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its easy to get the country riled up over a dozen cops fucking up a dozen really if it were only a dozen wed be fine the problem is that the cops a product of the culture and training of their department fuck up and then their departments defend their actions there are far too many dozens of examples of police officers fucking up but for every fuck up there are of police officers who contribute to rather than try to combat the very culture which fosters the fuckups
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the issue is one of accountability and responsibility when a regular individuala butcher saycommits a crime only that individual is responsible for said crime but a police officer is an agent of the state paid and empowered by said state to enforce its laws therefore a crime committed by a police officer in the line of duty is necessarily a crime committed by the state thats why its right and justified for the citizenry to get riled up over a dozen cops fucking up around black people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when doing their jobs means violently enforcing nonviolent crimes we have a problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the last line is accurate its the sentence before it that is complete and utter horse shit apparently the issue with police violence is that the communities most often brutalized victimized and killed by police need to be more helpful to the police because said brutalizations victimization and murder has really done wonders for building trust thats about as sound an argument as if he didnt want to get shot by the police he shouldnt have run awaywalked awaydone what the officer asked himreached for his wallet when asked to give his id
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well it certainly isnt going to be the oppressors that will change a system thats favorable for them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not actually that insane its not like the so called oppressors are going to enact spontaneous change by themselves it requires a complete change of attitude both inside and outside the system for any marked progress to be made just one or the other will not do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,way worse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was thinking of us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always turn down the music when im approaching my destination and start looking for parking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what nightmares are made of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my first instinct would probably be to try to get out through the smallest window i could find
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more than likely tires or glass popping this explorer more than likely has a fuel cut off switch my old ass toyota didnt and it still didnt explode when it was fully engulfed explosions are from movies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it entirely depends on the city where i grew up you got a position as a cop if you decided not to go to college and were popular enough they spent their nights harassing the girls driving around and taking peoples beer and sending them on their way compare that to when i lived in mnpls mn im sure more than a fair share of them have had guns pointed at them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hysterical strength can do crazy shit cop probably hurt like hell the next day but hey worth it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont mention it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think he means more of this type of news instead of the violence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,local news lets get the mega news corporations on board with some positivity eh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure but will they be playing it for the next two weeks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes probably referring to national media
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how many good apples does it take to save the bunch you will never ever have no bad apples never across any industry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ehhh your missing the point once its captured on video and recorded to a hard drive the violation of a patients rights has already occurred imagine if you asked a doctor for information about a patient and they gave you their medical history with a sharpie and said just sharpie out the parts that cant be shared someone has to do the editing and its not gonna be a doctor that means someone would see patients private info that makes it illegal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they can easily censor that information before releasing the videos i absolutely agree with everyone here about the body cameras and how they shouldnt be able to shut them off then shoot some guy in the neck but you dont understand the amount of work it takes to review videos pretend you are doing it at speed you would need half as many more people than there are police officers reviewing videos for as long as the cameras are on a department of cops with cameras on hours a day would need people reviewing videos hours every single day there is a true administrative cost there and it is a legitimate concern for police departments that they have brought up but i say they need to figure it out hell these days you can just use the gps coordinates and mark out red zones if a cop enters a red zone hospital then thats the video that gets double checked and censored while other videos go through a more cursory cheaper solution
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hipaa is nothing like a foil request
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why not have street cams like in london
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when the dog attacks then you shove your arm down its throat before it can bite you and suffocate it to death
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is some value to this if you run over in your head how youll react in a given situation enough it will create pathways in your brain that make that reaction more likely in the moment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the occupant yes the cameras arent the best i think theyre lower than so its hard to tell im not sure the extent of his injuries but id imagine broken bones laceractions and possible burns regardless the occupant went to the hospital
UpliftingNews,not_removed,amen should be mandatory
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in denver we activate and deactivate based on our own judgementaccording to rules and regs activating stores the last seconds prior to activating minus audio if someone complains and ia finds out you didnt have it activated you get punished i think this tends to work best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then set up rules that only allow the footage to be played in a criminal investigation or with the officers permission how does it work with vehicle cameras as i understand it all cop cars have them and if they let someone off with a warning its also on that camera
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah thats such a crap argument though just about every cop lets people off with warnings officer discretion is built into the job i have never once heard of an officer being disciplined for letting the odd speeder off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they remove officers discretion from the equation ever been let off with a warning been ticketed for less than the amount you were actually speeding if a supervisor reviews body cam footage and sees that happening the officer could be facing suspension or termination thats a good thing officer discretion is one of the many ways institutionalized racism manifests itself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no ones reviewing routine traffic stop footage unless it becomes an unroutine stop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everytime ive interacted with the police they told me in advance they were going to be recording not that i could deny them the right theyre copsbut then again i know i dont have anything to worry about as long as im not the one fuckin up and i do as they say of course not saying they have the right to abuse the fact that theyre cops and beat ppl but would u back talk ya mom they same way some ppl talk to cops shit not me my mom raised me better than thatas for others idk as far as the video shownprops to the officer not all cops are crap most get a bad rap some are dicks and get over but not all we have no right to single out an entire group as a whole bc of the actions caused by few
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you argument doesnt hold water it kind of does though i moved on from being a cop to greener pastures before body cams were as prevalent as they are becoming now i would have been happy to wear one as my useofforce incidents were legit but a lot more people wouldve gone downtown for possession charges also id be far less likely to just throw out a personaluse amount of weed or trash someones crush kit if i know the footage has the potential to end up on the morning news by the book law enforcement is great for using and escalating force but it removes a leos ability to use discretion to avoid ruining an addicts life more than it already is im not saying the cams are a bad idea i just dont think they should be picked apart unless theres a complaint
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt make an argument i only asked a few questions i agree with most of your response im only trying to make the point that sometimes there are gray areas and that just because cops arent jumping in line for these cameras doesnt mean that they are bad cops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ijs i can certainly make a lethal weapon out of just about everything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry but blm has essentially proven that cops are getting a raw deal even when they are upholding the law good luck convincing thousands of these amazing people to join the police force when you make it harder to do their jobs and still get paid peanuts considering they went through an academy to get there you can do a helluva lot better and still uphold the law without the public criticizing your every move in another job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how so these things are not bringing in views or clicks so they will never make the headlines people are not interested in good things happening or about the kind of things cops are exposed to and do everyday across the entire world they want to see cops fuck up they want to see that awful human being in a uniform to be able to project their hate onto a target to be able to vent their frustration from all the speeding tickets they got and be able to say hah i knew it im a good person and they are all awful thats why they punish me this will change nothing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the local government should settle any and all wrongful losses of life and police should be held more accountable but calling the entire group of individuals that enforce the law racist because an unnamed cop shot a person who happened to be black without any details is irresponsible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,apparently the issue with police violence is that the communities most often brutalized victimized and killed by police need to be more helpful to the police thats not what it said and you know it because said brutalizations victimization and murder has really done wonders for building trust so has brutilizations rape murder thug culture and aint seen nothing culture has done wonders for building trust
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can somewhat see what they mean but its worded poorly turn of the century new york police oppressed the hell out of the irish irish gangs all over the place police still to this day calling it a paddy wagon from a practice of rounding up drunk irish bastards fast forward to just after world war and the stereotype of a cop is an irishman rather than fight the police they took the police over they applied for police positions harder than anyone else then once they got in started hiring more irish ahead of other folks a racist practice but besides the point if youre tired of being oppressed by the police take them over apply for being the cops get connections use those connections to make your friends cops dont oppress your own people and in so doing you just stopped your oppression
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in a socalled civilised society any group being oppressed shouldnt even be a thing so in that context its very much the onus of those with the means to enact change to make it happen and that isnt the oppressed if the description of oppressed is accurate it doesnt matter what that group does if it doesnt have the means to change things the oppressor will always just laugh at them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,imagine if all bodycams recorded vertically
UpliftingNews,not_removed,speaking from experience you are correct its something you never forget and often relive on a daily basis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not sure if accurate but this news article says
UpliftingNews,not_removed,surprisingly this was a city cop from a medium sized city with a not so great reputation edithes the chief of the local uni pd now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,something bad may have happened tune in to find out edit it did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but in most industries the good apples root out the bad apples they dont cover for them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well if the good apples decide the blue line of silence doesnt apply to the bad apples then they will selfgovern much more effectively keeping quiet letting bad behavior slide getting shit from other good apples for reporting abuse to superiors thats why even good apples arent always proactively good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,technically that already happens even if the encounter isnt videotaped
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then they shouldnt just leave that information just lying around an alternative is circularly polarise the lens and stick a transparent sheet of oppositely polarised material over the information the people present can read it if necessary but it isnt recorded to camera the other alternative is the good ol folder body cams have proven themselves necessary this one tiny issue shouldnt get in the way when its a simple engineering problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont deal with hipaa but correct me if i am wrong hipaa only applies to healthcare providers and certain government programs that provide healthcare services my understanding is police would be excluded from hipaa regulation and even if they werent why would body cam footage be shared in a way for hipaa to apply
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly then you swing your dog glove at additional threats
UpliftingNews,not_removed,visualization is a good training tool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i thought we were talking about the officer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id prefer local municipalities decide how to do this and if its needed that is a great way to make sure that the places that really need body cams never get them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the same people who pay for the cameras that we already require in every police car you the taxpayer its needed period i dont think thats a question anymore if you were in the situation they were in the police would you rather the video that comes out be full and complete or partial and from a cell phone its the same reason that you dont answer questions without your attorney present context matters completeness matters partial statements and videos generally are biased towards one side or the other rather than plainly presenting the facts of what happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that will probably happen on its own as the liability insurance providers for police departments will no doubt require them sometime soon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would imagine the drop in law suits and time saved on cut and dry cases would pay for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how does it work with vehicle cameras as i understand it all cop cars have them and if they let someone off with a warning its also on that camera i think it dependsi know their dash cameras turn on when the sirenslights are activated but not sure if it continues to record if the lights are turned off i imagine it stays on but if not there is still the possibility that it doesnt pick up audio
UpliftingNews,not_removed,either that or just make officer discretion an official thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think thats true but ive seen three points raised it might be something more serious than a traffic stop eg a teenager in possession of marijuana an otherwise routine incident might get seen when a supervisor is reviewing an incident from the same day a cop might let one person off with a warning but ticket another for the same offense later the ticketed person could subpeona the cops body cam footage and make a claim that the law is not being enforced fairly on the one hand i think there is value in office discretion but on the other hand i dont think officers are always egalitarian when it comes to handing out warnings vs punishments edit here is an showing biases in tickets vs warnings the most interesting thing to me is there is a very strong positive correlation between age and the chance of getting a warning this seems backwards to me since the older driver has obviously had more time on the road to learn the rules
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure not everything needs to be handled with the nuclear option with prosecution in court you can use education to correct correctable actions but somethings like corruption should be a one time job ender
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you say this on a front page post
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre lumping people into a group as well though cant you see your hypocrisy using the word they that many times cant be good you want a target for your hate this video has upvotes on reddit so your first statement is just plain wrong try having a nuanced opinion instead of blaming others for painting with a broad brush then grabbing it out of their hands and dipping it in your ink
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you still try evil wins when good people do nothing and whatnot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,calling the entire group of individuals that enforce the law racist because an unnamed cop shot a person who happened to be black without any details is irresponsible normally this would not be an unreasonable statement if doj reports from cities and did not indicate that systemic racial issues are deeply embedded in many police departments edit that said i didnt mention racism at all just merely pointing out how conflating the individual and the institution can be justified when that individual is empowered and paid by the stateinstitution purportedly working in said stateinstitutions interests
UpliftingNews,not_removed,word for word no but it may as well have and its the job of the police to enforce the law fairly and equitably without victimizing those they are supposed to protect yes the things you mention are not unique to any single community and yet certain communities are cited s being the sole exhibitors of that behavior its a bullshit argument there are plenty of groups of citizens nonprofits churches etc working in highcrime areas to improve the community but continue with the brought it upon themselves narrative if you want
UpliftingNews,not_removed,liveleak would be pretty fucking angry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre speaking for yourself i am so incredibly sorry that you experienced something like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah eyeballs or a camera it doesnt matter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i could envision potential liability suits against the providerhospital ie you knew there was a camera in the room etc however it would in theory be easy to blur out sensitive information prior to public release i truly hope this doesnt become an issue when it comes to body cams
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my understanding is hipaa applies to any organization that collects or has any medical information in its possession im a police dispatcher i dont handle any kind of fire or ems calls unless police presence is requestedrequired but we do handle certain medical information example girlfriend calls because boyfriend just beat her up while gathering information she discloses that boyfriend has hepatitis c we can put that information into the computer because its a highly secured system but we arent allowed to say the name of the disease over the air because people could be listening to our broadcasts on a scanner and it would constitute a release of confidential medical information instead well say something like caution use universal precautions which is essentially code for look at your computer and find out what the person has before contacting them oh and wear gloves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mr brainfarts has a good post but to add a few more cents hipaa is just a giant pain in the ass a hospital cant even acknowledge that someone is a patient regardless of reason why they are there without their permission nor can they share information with the police without a warrant or the patients permission but i do wonder how it is a hospital is able to hold a news conference hours after a notable event such as a mass shooting and they sometimes give the name of a patient along with a basic status update
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hipaa applies to everyone unless consent is given wether expressed or implied those in direct patient care are allowed access nurse dr emt etc but are not allowed to disclose to anyone also not involved in patient care or on a consent list parent heath care proxy etc only a judge can make a call to release records the law cannot just walk into a hospital er and start rifling through charts to gain information just like they cannot search your vehicle without cause or permission capturing patient information on any device should technically not be shared or released you could blur it but it would defeat the purposefor example someone has to pull and review that tape take notice of phi protected health information if they notice then someone needs to doctor that tape and blur the phi that could in theory mean that many people who are not privy to that information see it the likelihood that a cam is going to pick up that brain scan of your grandmas massive brain bleed with her name dob and ssn and that someone might know her back at the station in internal affairs and blab about it to whomeverslim to none but its still a privacy right i hope that explains a bit side note i have experience in the field in public safety for medical calls for example the police officer assigned to the call only gets a name and dob thats it in my state edit a word
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but do we have a right to dog arms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait when did i ask if it were needed i just said i dont want federal government doing it its needed though like education is needed if my community feels as if there is no need then i can leave or accept it i cant do that with a federal mandate and they will take my money too most communities agree education is needed but most communities also agree the federal government is bad at education i want to decide what my police force does why should someone in washington do that they dont live here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well a cops lights are always left on when they park behind someones car after pulling them over
UpliftingNews,not_removed,absolutely crooked cops should be fired and prosecuted but should a good cop have his record filled with negative paperwork because someone was analyzing his every move documenting his mistakes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh reddit is mainstream media suddenly or known to the larger public
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not world star videos tho
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it happened a long time ago while the memory of it is still clear the pain has dulled over the years thank you for your kind words
UpliftingNews,not_removed,glad to hear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously ask anyone when the last time they had a good interaction with a cop was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the majority of people wont be physically assaulted by police ill give you that but never have a negative interaction thats absurd
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre primarily used to warn traffic so im sure you can imagine some scenarios where that might not be necessary depends on the situation really
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think you can answer that for yourself assuming we all believe in a certain amount of reasonableness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it has over twenty million unique visitors a month thats pretty mainstream
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well yeah its the most popular website in the world httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofmostpopularwebsites
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think it then becomes an issue of something that the hospital needs to keep confidential would need to be edited by someone who works at the police department either way though im sure those people already have ndas or something similar for the identities that theyre censoring before going public with the video
UpliftingNews,not_removed,imo it is not a good study as the information was self reported
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean thats a lot but look at twitter and facebook twitter has nearly million unique users a day and facebook blows both out of the water with over billion unique users per day it will be seen by many on reddit and will likely be shared by many on other outlets but i wouldnt say reddit is mainstream
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as i said a massive network website far from a news page
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i too work for a fire department for those curious most places where the fire department is very busy are places of low income resulting in low taxes resulting in the fire department not having the best equipment complete opposite in wealthier areas they are not as busy due to a more educated population who dont call as their primary care givers also usually have newer construction homes that help prevent fires and are more fire educated more income means more taxes means better equipment you get the picture source i have worked in both areas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dunno where you said massive network website you said mainstream media which it obviously is but whatevz
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pussy or penis your rights should be the same
UpliftingNews,not_removed,however it ruled that a transgender person carrying visible signs of both genders or intersex may not marry anyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is something amazing and i hope they continue down that path
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a small step in the right direction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone here is shadowbanned
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sure this will go over well i can almost read the next headline
UpliftingNews,not_removed,still fine to kill them though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,meh i highly doubt this article is true and if it was not like pakistan has a thriving transsexual population most lgbtq people are regularly persecuted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha well put
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pakistan trounces unification church record for largest wedding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and untrue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they kill gays not trans
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that wouldnt be surprising
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same difference
UpliftingNews,not_removed,red flags
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i see this posted in rrising every day can we give it a week please
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hmmm if its true this is the absolute first thing trumps done thats useful and positive since the inauguration i hope its just one step in a series of actions he could take that benefit people who arent rich

UpliftingNews,not_removed,my mom used to keep the entire trunk of our oldsmobile laden with an indexed boxes of coupons wed be in the grocery store parking lot and she would open that trunk up like it was filled with high priced merchandise and get to work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shit and i just let my food items parish i need to donate more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats with all the people hanging out behind the news desk is that a thing now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly how extreme couponing should be used lots of people that i know that do this do it for the thrill not sure what kind of thrill you get from getting stuff for free using coupons i also know some that give away the stuff they dont want to their church but this woman sets a great example
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats amazing i only see coupons for hair coloring dog food and heartburn medicine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aww thats what we need more of in this world right now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she also makes me feel rich is what you should think student debts and all that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not hard to imagine the thrill take whatever your interested in lets say pc gaming with focus to the pc for this say theres always some kind of deal from the store on the components you want for your pc any of them even accessories you think are cool but would never spend the money onk so theres all these deals going on all the time and then you find out that intel or corsair has manufactuer coupons in addition to those sales so for purposes of this hypothetical imagine now that you can then purchase all these components in a way that utilizes deals with other deals all of a sudden your getting free fans no you didnt need them but they look cool and are now free you just got your for a fraction of the price and when its all said and done you still get towards your next purchase your gonna want to do that again suddenly your console bros are like you got that monster for how much so then you team up with them use your credit plus your experienced saavy and voila you just participated in extreme couponing it was time consuming but now youve got a bag full of thermal compound and a rocket fast set up and thats just your first time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i do know its illegal in some states to feed the poor which to me is a ridiculous law i am sure if some certain politicians were on the other end of things it would be alot different

UpliftingNews,not_removed,wouldnt this kid be able to supply teddy bears a year for charity much more efficiently if he got a paper route and an alibaba account hes wasting a lot of his time with rote stitching that could be used for personal development or studying or something useful so that he doesnt eventually become a charity case himself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,twelveyearold boys mom

UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read it as twelveyearold boy screws teddy bears a year for charity twelveyearold me couldve raised a ton of money for charity if that was the case

UpliftingNews,not_removed,not a similar situation but i married my wife less than three weeks before she died from cancer we had lived together for a decade and basically considered ourselves commonlaw married but i thought she deserved better than that and so wanted to do it properly before the end i should have done it long before that because thats what she deserved but there you go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,apparently im not worthy of watching this video because im in australia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we need to have a separate subreddit for this shit this is bittersweet its not goddamn uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i actually know these two i was a senior when they were juniors if you could see the type of love they have for each other youd understand this decision
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill likely be crucified for this but i think this is horrifying that girl is going to be ruined for the rest of her life nothing like a decision you make when youre to effect the rest of the years you have even if the guy survives what kind of relationship would it end up basically a woman resenting a man for trapping her into a marriage with a terminal disease i guarantee it its weird to me that things like this are celebrated edit holy shit this comment blew up over the weekend i wasnt expecting for the majority of people to agree but the masses have spoken thanks to everyone that participated in the healthy debate it was awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know why these death bed marriages are posted in r uplifting news i cant be the only one that just finds this depressing af
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uplifting they got married in the hospital cause hes probably gonna die this is some fault in our stars shit op
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does that mean if he passes away god forbid that she is responsible for the medical expenses
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good for them fuck cancer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,had cancer about a year ago fully expected my boyfriend to leave me but he didnt i know how happy he is brings me to mixed tears
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats like the opposite of uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was diagnosed at age with ewings it took me a year and a half to finish chemo and recover from surgery that removedreplaced my knee femur and hip with metal bones long story short having ewings is pretty shitty and the chemo is even shittier but depending on the location of the tumor how far it has metastasized and a few other factors he has a decent chance of recovering anyone who has fought cancer will tell you your attitude makes all the difference between winning and losing and it seems like he is stronger and happier than ever before after this when i was in chemo the greatest moments that kept me striving to get better were when every other month my girlfriend was able to get away from college and life for a weekend to come see me those visits kept me determined to make it back to normal life again when otherwise i really cant say if id been able to keep my head up i think a lot of redditors concern over this is justified this couple is young it was a spurofthemoment decision and who knows what the future holds but like the visits from my girlfriend moments like this can define your battle with cancer and become the driving force behind your will to survive recover and lead a normal life again heres hoping this wedding will lead to the latter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminds oh hospice by the antlers great album
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats like a reverse walk to remember so very sweet i truly hope the best for this couple
UpliftingNews,not_removed,put him in overwatch because hes widowmaker im horrible kill me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people saying theyre too young for marriage well yeah but hes also too young to die
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not really sure whats uplifting here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,already had an emotional week at work now reddit has me choking up on a saturday night damn you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,doesnt this depress anyone else im not left feeling uplifted but depressed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i was in his shoes and this is just me btw if it was me id probably just look at her and say find someone else and be happy im just glad we had the time together and that it went a lot move on now if i die then you will not be weighed down by me then again i feel like i bother most people these days perhaps it would be different if i was in the hospital and only wanted to be loved
UpliftingNews,not_removed,around seven months ago i proposed to my fiance two weeks before she was diagnosed with a rare form of aml leukemia she gets a drug from bayer to suppress her protein mutation to stay in remission her stem cell transplant was last friday but shell need to take the drug for a minimum of two years and the second we get married no more free drug i earn too much and insurance refuses to pay for it its a shitty spot to be in to be with the person you want to marry but be unable to because it will break the charitable gift from bayer thats keeping her in remission
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what the hell yahoo if you want people to read your uplifting news article you might want to make the video not not available in your area sorry or not this is a good way to make yourself irrelevant even faster
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everyone has different opinions on it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reddit is full of painfully self righteous and sophomoric attitudes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is he gonna make it or is this like a get married so he can have a happy memory before he dies kinda thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont really battle bone cancer it just takes you after months of destroying you from the inside
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for some reason bone cancer scares me as fuck i remember when i saw on rcreepy a picture of a human bone deteriorated by bone cancer and its so scary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not the only thing hes got goin through his bone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the ad playing before the video in the article was a nexium ad it featured a guy tearing into ribs at what looked like was a cook off poor ad much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wondering how much of this decision was influenced by pity from the healthy person and again how much it was influenced by not wanting to be perceived as a scumbag for turning down the proposal of someone with cancer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a few questions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,op you have a weird concept of uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a terrible thought though does this leave her libel for his hospital bill if he dies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shes beautiful just had to say it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,smart way to get in on the inheritance this kid is going places
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a really horrible situation and i hope he is able to pull through but honestly i think getting married was not the best idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love when i read comments on reddit it goes from terminal cancer patient marries his high school sweetheart to bear fucking ladies and gentlemen i give you reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good luck you crazy kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is selfish on the part of the patient that poor girl is going to be a widow before she turns
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they shouldnt do this its not fair on the person who lives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this might sound wrong but he did really well in personality and looks there are so many women out there that wouldnt go near a guy in this unfortunate situation let alone marry him congrats to both
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my uncle passed away of brain cancer many years ago he and his wife married not long before he passed he was very sick at his wedding i was a flower girl his wife remarried and had kids but still remains part of the family she owns his grave plot still
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh this is so sweet wishing them the best it just kinda feels like this would be a really good movie too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yahoo news links should be banned unless people enjoy seeing ads before being able to view the story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone make an rupliftingbadideas for stories that make you go awwwwww gets teary eyed oh wait thats a terrible idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats pretty fucking cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cancer is getting fucked tonight
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how only regret was that he had boneitis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i went to high school with swift and abbi kids in our class were diagnosed with cancer and he unfortunately is the only one still in the midst of it all he has been in and out of remission since grade hes truly one of the strongest kids i know cool thing to see this story on reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god bless both of their souls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously fuck bone cancer having seen the picture of it before of what it looks like in your skull creeps me the fuck out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its going to be really awkward for her if he doesnt die
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awww thats not gonna last
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a walk to remember rip off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope he gets the help he needs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder what her reaction will be if he actually lives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sadly this is mostly likely a very misguided and rushed thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this story really hit home for me jesus i havent cried this much for an article before people with cancer really are brave people we can learn a lot from them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,geez must suck having boner cancer on your wedding night
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the pittty relationships i hope shes doing it for the right reasons and sincerely loves him even if it is pitty it doesnt make her a bad person or anything just young inexperienced and scared i guess it depends on whether she met him and started dating before he got sick or after plus either way it takes major commitment to give that much of yourself to another person hospital guest chairs are fucking terrible even the nice ones did they register anywhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shes gonna leave him later shes doing this right now just for the attention and probably some money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,guys meet the next dr cameron
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hopefully it isnt a similar situation in what happened in downton abbey
UpliftingNews,not_removed,downton abbey did it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good story but man yahoo is awful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,goldenrod and the stone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,solid humbleboast
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a lot like that movie where that happens
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,both of my exes married guys who died of cancer not too long after the second one he died so soon she doesnt even get social security for him just was stuck with his bills first one got a great kid out of it and has remarried and had more kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats some cameron stuff over there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a mixed bag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unfortunately bone cancer story video is not good for my region
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his only regret is that he has boneitus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more of a sad like many things here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,autoplay music popup blacking out the screen and asking me to change my search provider to yahoothink i figured out why theyre failing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,child marriage so sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,perfect marriage not only is she free to marry people in the future but he is going to get thinner the longer the marriage goes on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant imagine having to constantly worry wether your fiancé will live another day or not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it terminal or do you think he will pull through
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i hope its a long ceremony cause its gonna be a short honeymoon dark helmet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn onions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not to be grimbut wouldnt she inherit his hospital bills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i somehow find this very depressing but then again i always do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wth nobody else is annoyed by ops stupid and unnecessary capitalizations
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats really cool that they got married bone cancer is creepy af httpiimgurcomenqdwjpg
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really hate cancer it is my mortal enemy good for them look that awful disease in the eye and spit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know the situation theyre in is unlike any other kids their age theyre already growing too fast for fuck sakes this young boy has already matured so much just by facing death at such a young age the fact that people talk shit is so disgusting she is the love of his life because its the only love he has in what could be his very short life people just need to shut up sometimes and let them be happy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shes going to inherit some huge debt wewlad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes child the name of the hospital is st francis childrens hospital is still an adolescent year most pediatricians treat up to years of age its legal but its still child marriage imo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anyone still reading this swift passed away tonight in the midst of multiple shows of love for him at football games throughout the city his wife says that he only wanted people to say that he won against cancer for the seventh time even in death he conquered people may not find this uplifting but he brought together two schools that are typically in a heated rivalry tonight he united so many people inspired so many people and while his loved ones hearts are broken those whom he impacted know that theyll be okay because there is no way a community that has been this committed to seeing one child through his battle will let him down now thats pretty damn uplifting in the suburbs of a city that is currently torn apart by the terrence crutcher shooting please if its your thing pray for abbi and swift for the myers for sand springs and for tulsa i have never seen so many people pull together for one person swift helped me believe in the good in the world and i know im not the only one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my husband and i were when we married and celebrated our year last month due to the timing of our marriage and birthdays were turning this year too lol he isnt just joining the navy we were positive we wanted to be together and were planning it before then too people are surprised sometimes but then they see how we are towards each other and they always understand immediately its because we truly are each others other halves i would do exactly the same if i were in her shoes you dont date someone just to date them there is a chance however small that youre marrying this person she believed she would marry him truly and wholeheartedly and this was exactly the right thing to do im happy for them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i had a dollar for every shitty negative comment on this post i could afford to buy this couple a nice gift seriously why cant there be some kind of rule about asshole comments on this sub people who know the couple are reading this thread and making fun of the decisions of a couple working through a horrible situation is beyond awful fuck you guys this couple is sweet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its like a real like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,look at her facial expression where she appears in profile whats your read of what shes feeling
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well of marriages end in divorce so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he said will you be my wife and weve always joked about so i just kind of laughed abbi told abc news today the next day he said you know i was being serious right see you in rpussypassdenied in less than hours
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can they smash like have sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did he get to consummate the wedding did he smash
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eww yahoo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so did they consummate the marriage on the hospital bed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just started to tear up reading this there is nothing fair in this world why is this happening to so many people around the world and im over here living a good life and can barely seem to find the will to live there is nothing fucking fair about this world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a grown fucking man and this story is overwhelming me with feels
UpliftingNews,not_removed,happy story i really hope the guy ended up getting laid too downvote me all you want but if he didnt that would really make this story kind of sad all the same no
UpliftingNews,not_removed,saddest thing is she knows he is going to die so she gets that sweet sweet moneyh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hate to be brutal but im being honest what do you think the chances are of her only agreeing to it one way or another because she knew hed be dying in not too long
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if she put out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,vicar till death do you part her friday yeh sure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oooooh call me names instead of providing statistics to back up your argument makes you look pretty cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought it said boner cancer im fucking retarded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,impatient golddigger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,think he smashed it after the ceremony
UpliftingNews,not_removed,slightly different but my mum knew a man who was ill from a cancer and he was dying he liked her and would have been happy with her but my mum didnt like him back and felt that it would have been wrong to have gone into a relationship with someone out of pity i completely understand why the woman in the article did this and it made the man happy and if thats what they both wanted them thats completely fine but it does pose a potentially large amount more grief if the man were to die not many people would be able to cope with this well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,story good and heartwarming story being hosted by yahoocom annoying and stupid with a stupid popup asking me to change my homepage to see search differently which also happens to block the article until i reload and hit stop to prevent it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is this good like ok they got married because he might die is that the gist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he better get her to sign a prenup
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hows she gonna pay those child support checks now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you go man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre a strong person happy to know there are people like you alive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how the fuck do you deal with that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,already was crying after reading that article now im crying more im so very sorry for your loss
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sorry about your loss as someone whos had cancer during a relatively new relationship i know how shitty it is but i know having someone there for me made all the difference for me dont be so hard on yourself just sticking around is a feat in itself and the fact that you married her is awesome you are amazing truly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i teared up a little
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not crying i am just allergic to emotions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im really sorry for your loss ❤️
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so you got the infection from a bear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well hello there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know much about skin infections but i do know one thing this guy fucks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a i feel your pain b regarding your username are they as bad as those bnestrong peeps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,vpn is the answer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cunt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if this is true it makes it alot more acceptable to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whether or not she marries him if he dies which is very likely given the type of cancer this issurvival rates for a recurrence like this are crap and ive seen people die in the worst ways with this shell be very traumatized for life anyways im not sure the marriage is the best idea but to be honest it doesnt really make this any worse or better unless as you say he survives and turns out to not be right for her which is unfortunately actually very unlikely to happen one of my best friends died of a chronic illness and it leaves a big mark on her boyfriend at the time whos now married and has kids i think he dealt with it as well as he could have and even named one of his kids after her honestly its not the getting married part thats going to traumatize her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my personal stance and why i posted it is because i think its endearing chances are yah she married him because he was dying but its made him very happy and is helping with his treatment call me optimistic but i would do the same thing just to give my sweetheart something he wouldnt otherwise realistically be able to have hes going to die and when he does its going to crush her its going to crush her just as much as him dying as her boyfriend as it would him as her husband why not make it a little better and give someone you love the gift of marriage not like that piece of paper will make it any harder or less hard for her when he does pass on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,huhwhenever i see stories like this i just assume that everyone knows the patient is a goner and hasnt got long to live so they try to make the persons last few days on this rock enjoyable and take a bit of the pain away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not to mention things like the passing of any assets power of attorney for healthcare to make decisions when he cant life insurance policies the kid may have on his life health insurance status can change if married etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not sure why it seems that everyone feels like this is some type of orwellian teenage drama where the blushing bride is ruined for eternity i see similar situations in the hospital on a regular basis with terminal patients sometimes its for love sometimes its for friendship and sometimes as hard as it is to believe its similar to a business transaction for all we know this young man may love this young lady dearly and he wants her to be well cared for after he goes odds of his family having a decently sized life insurance policy on a sick child are rather high maybe he wants her to go to the best schools or maybe she just did it because she loves him tremendously just because theyre young doesnt mean theyre dumb theyve been in a relationship for multiple years and hes been sick before recently for a while im sure theyre both pretty conscious of the situation and its consequences ive seen lots of young people do quite a few hastily arranged things during long medical treatments and sometimes it works out excessively well for all involved it just takes a level of maturity that comes from dealing with the circumstances and has little or nothing to do with age ive also met and know many adolescent oncology patients that id consider much more mature than some adults i know
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its fine with me because they were already dating for two years mind you i have no idea how their relationship was before but she was fine with it being a real wedding and so was her dad so who the fuck are we to judge at that point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i understand where youre coming from but you cant push your feelings onto her everyone has different opinions and feelings on marriage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this seems to me like a dick move to ask someone to marry you when youre dying she didnt even say yes the first time he said will you be my wife and weve always joked about so i just kind of laughed abbi told abc news today the next day he said you know i was being serious right welp hopefully he pulls through and theyre happily ever after
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i met my now wife when i was years old years ago the only difference between him and me is he made the comitment at instead of in his they could be the happiest couple for decades if he pulls through or it could be a horrible marriage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well they have known each other since grade im sure they are very much in love and while i see where youre coming from there is probably a good chance they would have been married without the cancer too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how can you consider this to be ruining for her he asked her to marry him but its much deeper than that and you are missing it completely he knows he wont be escaping this he asked his best friend to be the one who shepherds him from this life to whatever is next theres no greater honor than that hes entrusting his very soul and being into her care to share this transition and she is ruined oh you mean in learning how fleeting life can be ruined by now knowing how important today really is and that nothing goes on forever she will have a perspective that very few will have at her age and she will be better for it ive been in that bed and felt what he is feeling nothing comforts you like true support and his wife is offering hers dying is really bleak guys its terrifying and lonely and sad if she chooses to help him then lets support them both and not shit all over her fantastically good deed here realistically this is over in short order anyway im sorry dude i really am and her life will go back to what it was she wont though shell be all the more human
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my first reaction too just so many ways this could end terribly for her and not many it could end well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cancer really isnt a disease that traps you into lifelong suffering you either beat it or you die and once youre at stage you really dont have much time left if he survives he is likely to live a mostly healthy life unless the cancer comes back and if it comes back hes much less likely to beat it again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah this isnt uplifting at all a kid is dying and only sees happiness for him in the form of a marriage with a girl who probably really cares for him but also probably wouldnt have married him if he werent dying now if he lives they will be married and have to deal with the decision they made at and under duress if he dies that poor girl is going to be miserable or maybe its true love not impossible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,personally i think its a perfectly fine starter marriage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not like anyone is forcing her to do this she had a choice and she made a noble decision instead of bolting when things got tough she stuck by him and that says something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you cant guarantee that thats incredibly naive to think that you can guarantee that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and who gets saddled with the remaining medical bills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its oklahoma people eat this kind of schlock up there because the lord works in mysterious ways
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shes in love with and has spent two years with someone who is dying of cancer her life is already irrevocably changed because of this she is experiencing something most people never do they understand the brevity of life on a different level and are both coping with it the best they can they have decided they want to be married when he dies this is not uncommon when couples face terminal illness i hope you never experience this and have to find out what it is like try not to judge or project your own insecurities on two young people who are facing profound terror together
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah this is pretty selfish of the dude tbh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah thats actually exactly what i thought when i read this if he survives she will live a very unfulfilling life but imagine how hard it must have been for her when he proposed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i usually find stories like this to be sweet but yeah something about the storymaybe their age maybe how quickly they followed through maybe the way shes half smiling in the picture makes me feel like maybe they should have waited a bit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it clearly isnt something that just anyone would do thats why its a story in the first place but you seem to have a pretty strong opinion about a situation that in all likelihood you cannot empathize with whatsoever with people involved that you know practically nothing about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a terrible hasty childish teenage decision just for show but upliftingnews peddles so much garbage on reddit its expected
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty much shes married him with the expectation that hes gonna die soon god knows what kind of legal mess could erupt if this kid racks up massive hospital debts which i expect he already has romantic gesture and all but i agree this is a great way to make a bad situation even worse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that girl is going to be ruined for the rest of her life are you a year old girl because this is the most overdramatic thing i have read all day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if everyone could rewind the decisions they made at what makes you think it would change anything marriage isnt about sticking it when things are rough its sticking on when things are not yeah maybe he did trap the girl into marrying him or maybe the girl wants him for herself because she cant see herself loving anyone else i dont know i just know that dude knows that death is a coming and he wants to feel loved i dont blame him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,on the plus side shes going to be getting amazing tax benefits for being a qualifying widower if he lives more than a year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is more for him than her i think
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i totally get where youre coming from and i think its a valid concern its definitely not the only outcome however if he gets better theres nothing to say that their marriage cant work out cancer is a horrific thing but from personal experience it can also bring out the best in people if he succumbs the marriage has brought two families together not just in grief but in joy for the happiness the couple shared if however brief theyll hopefully find peace in this and be there for one another more than if the two hadnt gotten married all that being said are we even sure this was a real marriage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminds me of that episode of house where the woman agrees to donate kidney i think to her girlfriend even though she knows her girlfriend was planning on breaking up with her so that she could trap the girlfriend into a relationship built on guilt i dont think this is nearly as sinister but this girl would have been crucified for saying no to his proposal i dont think anybody should get married at you just arent ready and what is the point its nice to symbolize your love but i really could see this ending up that this girl has a whole lot of legal issues and potentially medical debt piled on her in her late teensearly twenties
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah is not when you should decide to get married basically a woman resenting a man for trapping her into a marriage with a terminal disease i guarantee it i mean hes probably just going to die so im not sure this will happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i came to say the same thing its a sweet story but really
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no one is being trapped its their own mistake
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was extremely selfish of him to ask it was extremely stupid for her to say yes i dont necessarily blame them because theyre years old and year olds are really stupid but their parents should have parented and said no
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yah things like this are celebrated on garbage daytime tv its on gma being sold to stay at home moms and old people watch cry inside someting something marriage toss in some jesus cry on the outside a little because dude is basically dead in a few years something something that cancer movie stars something money in reality this is just two stupid kids getting married really young because one of the stupid kids is going to die
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think that the point was that hes almost definitely going to die soon shell be a young widow with the rest of her life still ahead of her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,remindme one month check up on this news story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why would she be any more ruined just for being married if he dies she will suffer the same loss of the same partner regardless of whether they are married the marriage only serves to show the rest of the world what their relationship meant to each other which i guess means she cant so easily hide that but i dont see why she should want to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my thoughts exactly i was hospitalized frequently in high school due to chronic disease i still battle i dated two guys during this period and both ran for the hills im glad they did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my parents were married at and they are still together i dont think the age is a huge deal i get what youre saying about the possibility she will resent this and feel trapped but if i was in her situation and my girlfriend had cancer i wouldnt think twice about marrying her as much as it would hurt to watch her go i think it would hurt more to know we could have been husband and wife but i chickened out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think its beautiful but my anxiety ridden mind instantly thought will she inherit his medical bills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree with you though my high school girlfriend and i were madly in love too and i could see us being dumb and doing something like this in a similar situation but now that i am an adult it would seem fucking insane for something like that to happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow i didnt even think of the emotional part just the shared debt from getting married haunting her for her whole life am i an unfeeling robot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is something called love you know she may love him deeply
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cancer is not a terminal disease i for one hope the guy kicks its ass and they have a long happy and healthy life together i had osteosarcoma at and thankfully survived and am able to downvote your ignorant comment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you act like divorce does not excist if things are really wrong you can never be certain things truly well when you marry you know and you know nothing ohene these peoples relationships it used to be normal for yong people get married but now people think teens like they are still little kids and late like they are teens still in maturity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have several very severe chronic illnesses including one that means id be unlikely to make it through the next years at the most my husband married me because he loves me not because he feels sorry for me or because he wants to help with medical bills were brits or for any other patronising reason our love and our bond as partners has survived more relationship minefields than most people face in lifetimes and it has never been shaken do i not deserve love because i dont get a full lifetime am i deemed merely a burden to my husband or anyone else
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why the fuck is this the top comment jesus man let people have some peace and solidarity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i understand this feeling but i think it shows true love and purpose my mom married a man at and he got sick just after their marriage she went in not knowing the cancer obviously but dealt with it for two years leading up to his death she later married my dad and had my siblings and i but she looks back at it and knows that she married him for a reason not the typical spend life together and have a fsmily but rather as a partner to help him thru his fight and be with him in death she doesnt regret it one bit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i completly agree was going to mention something similar im glad this is top comment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its really ironic that people think these teens are too stupid to know what theyre getting into or what the most likely outcome of this situation will be and that all parentsfamilies involved would allow them to ruin themselves financially or emotionally its ironic because it makes you all look even more stupid because youre all just making dumb assumptions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ya pretty fucking far from uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought about that as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his parents are probably paying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he could have some hardcore insurance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do people seriously have to pay for stuff like this shouldnt it be mostly covered by insurance the government what if you cant pay and you tell them you cant pay do they just kick you out and not give you treatment what the hell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shout out to boosie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,isnt it the best feeling when they dont quit on you during that whole shitstorm makes you admire them on a whole new level
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reddit is really strange sometimesbut i value the insight youve brought to the conversation since you seem to know them a lot of people here are quick to judge without widening their perspective i almost regret posting this on the offchance this couple sees this and all this negativity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anyone who has fought cancer will tell you your attitude makes all the difference between winning and losing no absolutely not the thing that makes the difference between winning and losing are the physical things for example how spread is your tumor how well do your cells react to the treatment are you getting resistant to the treatment are you getting any blood clots as a result of the disease none of those things are affected by your attitude i think its greatly inappropriate unhelpful and plain wrong to claim that attitude is the difference between winlose because it suggests that those who dont survive their cancer didnt try hard enough didnt want it enough werent able to be positive or strong enough or went about things the wrong way and thats just not the case in fact even people with a great attitude and tons of willpower die from cancer attitude will do jack squat to cure you if the physical requirements to get better are not there in fact claiming that its all about attitude puts a great pressure and blame on the people who have to deal with the pain of seeing their disease get increasingly worse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously my parents got married around that age and are still together something around years later sometimes you just know that early
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also you never know dont know why so many feel the need to push judge bet on two people as young as they are especially when one is going through something so horrible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it could be symbolic so no bills for her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would assume or hope they signed a prenup or something that makes his debt his and hers hers or perhaps hes debt free you just dont know ive lived in a hospital for about years and im debt free i happen to have outstanding health insurance and am lucky enough to be able to afford all additional medical costs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no a person is not automatically responsible for any debts of their spouse she would need to affirmatively cosign or guarantee his medical expenses which i cant imagine she would do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,might not seem uplifting but if hell likely die may as well make their time together the very best it can be right shell be equally devastated if he dies regardless of if theyre married or not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive been surreptitiously honking into a tissue whenever so is out of the room haha no way i am not crying about something on reddit nope
UpliftingNews,not_removed,surprisingly that doesnt actually convince anyone at least in my case it didnt during chemo all that conversation with my girlfriend earned me was a lot of tears a severe scolding and a promise to never ask that again because she wasnt going anywhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for your contribution
UpliftingNews,not_removed,off topic happy cakeday in case no one else has wished you one yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have seen that spiky skull pic too had to bleach the shit outta my eyesstill can not unsee it😐😐😐😐😐
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminds me of freezerburnt ice cream
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or creepy girl that uses the terminal wing as her dating pool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,child theyre both
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seek help from a local professional
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they were together for years before he was even diagnosed she would be destroyed by his death whether or not they were officially married
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope they just graduated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they were together a few years before the cancer from what ive read
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you think an year old is worth a lot of money im more concerned that she felt a bit guilted in to doing it honestly i hope not and hope they can enjoy the time they have together
UpliftingNews,not_removed,username checks out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude you forgot to reply to the comment and accidentally started a new comment thread
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes a bedridden year old is worth so much money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no there were plenty of times i thought about ending it and on occasion the thought still crosses my mind but our two kids need at least one parent even if its the worse of the two
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one day at a time i compare it to falling down a well right to the bottom at the bottom you look up and its almost completely black with a speck of light at the top you climbtime passes and the light gets bigger and the darkness gets smaller its not a perfect metaphor but it does somewhat accurately describe how it was at least in the beginning right after i was actively thinking about not wanting to go on without her and the darkness was everywhere as time passed the darkness retreated little by little the darkness and the pain and the hurt is still down there and sometimes ill let myself access it for brief periods and have a good cry or something like that especially if i seehear something that reminds me of her but it doesnt control me the way it used to i wouldnt say im over it though and i dont think i ever will be but i still miss her so much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im definitely quietly sobbing right now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,never trust a bear even when she says its her first time edit and my gold cherry is popped from talking about bear fucking cheers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is that an obscure house reference edit found it season one episode httphousewikiacomwikimaternity tldr sick baby baby dies of virus revealed baby got virus because hospital volunteer sneezed on teddy bear and gave teddy bear to babies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he must have done it bearback
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he thought she was a maiden fair turns out she was all covered in hair
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpiimgurcomoehavgifv
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its afghanistanimation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what part of it were you struggling to accept
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh you mean they actually love each other i guess that makes it acceptable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im pretty optimistic when it comes to cancer and it would make me so excited if he survived but bone cancer is such a grey area when it comes to treatment because its nothing like the other more common types of cancer its such a cruelty and its so unfair for anyone to suffer from it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is he doing are his chances good for recovery
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this was exactly me and my ex he was in the hospital awaiting a heart and kidney transplant and we were all preparing for him to pass before he received the new organs it was fucking rough i doubt ill ever deal with something so soul crushing again i was and he was months into his hospitalization we got engaged we considered getting married while he was still in the hospital but opted to wait until he was healthy and out of the hospital we hoped for the best he was in that damn hospital for a year and a half and i almost lost him more times than i can count i was holding his hand one day and he coded i had to watch through the glass door of his cvicu room as the doctors brought him back the engagement started out sweetly enough we had been through a lot and wanted to make our time count we were confident if he survived that we would have a happy marriage after the engagement his mood was a lot better he didnt need to see his therapist as much he let me wheel him outside more but over time the situation became more and more grim and i wanted out it was too heartbreaking to take care of him stand by his side and wait for him to likely die an awful death but i couldnt leave how could i leave someone in his situation i began to resent him quietly at first and then i began lashing out the guilt ate at me i was his high school sweetheart everyone was rooting for us i couldnt leave my dying fiancé in the end he got his transplant hes as far as i know still doing well but after he got home instead of planning a wedding we just fought all the time he ultimately told me he hadnt loved me in a long time he kept me around because i was good at taking care of him situations like this especially when youre young can lead to rash decision making this kind of adversity can change people usually not for the better i wish these two the best but i cant help but worry when i read stories like this i too stayed by his side and barely slept and barely left the building i did it because i was riddled with guilt not out of love
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honest question how did his wife feel about their child being named after his ex i know its a sad situation but i dont feel like many people would be comfortable with that i wouldnt be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my niece had cancer and died at she also had a ceremony and married her long time boyfriend however they didnt file any paperwork this was mostly so steve would not be saddled with massive debt from her bills they might have just had a nice service and a special day without filing their legal paperwork
UpliftingNews,not_removed,would it not be possible for her to be forced to bear his remaining medical financial burden thats been one of my worries seeing these
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow i was kinda thinking the same thing as the original comment although doing crazy things young can be stupid this is probably the best thing thats happened to this young man in his life he has to come to the fact he has this lethal disease and i bet it is hard especially so young this is the type of thing that will be special even if he passes soon and the young lady lives to this is something that can bring hope into a persons life thats nearing the end its probably a good distraction for him as well she will always live with this special thing for the rest of her life and even if she marries someone else after hes gone this is the type of thing that can bring fulfillment to her life plus id rather see news like this as opposed to another terrorist attack or some stupid political propaganda
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she married him because she wanted to she did it right now because hes dying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are a few reasons why not but i dont want to piss on your sentiment toward the story i appreciate the content i just think this particular type of instance is relatively popular and i personally think its fucked up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly how exactly is this going to ruin the rest of her life if he survives how could it lead to resentment she agreed to it she clearly loves the guy and if he doesnt what effect could it have on the rest of her life so have you ever been married before yeah i married my high school boyfriend on his deathbed aw thats sweet any dude that makes a big deal out of that is a jerk she doesnt want anyway i just dont see how this is anything but a good thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,losing loved ones can sometimes have unseen soul crushing consequences i am not sure its possible to predict how youll react to death even if you know its coming
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i definitely dont want to sound like an ass but this story reminds me of part of downton abbey a young maid marries a soldier who is dying because he loves her but she cant handle the guilt of deceiving him and being called this hero after his death
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rn working in oncology pharmaceutical research the poor guy does not have long
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well said
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im totally cool with marriage i have lots of married friends the issue i have is marriage with stipulations its fucked up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he likely never joked about it once a dying man got no time for jokes regarding love and life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats my thought too i met my now wife at and started dating then we didnt marry for more years but in reality had it been at or wed still be the happy couple we are now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im happy for them but they are still young i have known many couples who knew each other as they grew up but as they matured they grew apart our wants and needs change this includes the things we look for in a partner i honestly hope that they make something of it however
UpliftingNews,not_removed,less than of people end up actually marrying their high school sweetheart and the ones that do end up divorced within years more than half the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre giving her a little too much credit shes going to be there for him whether they get married or not presumably its probably just him wanting to have an adult milestone under his belt before he dies so he can feel like he got to accomplish one big thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cancer really isnt a disease that traps you into lifelong suffering a lot of current treatments that can cure can also leave you with lifelong sideeffects like neuropathy fatigue chemo brain heart damage and more and those are just the ones i can list off the top of my head for my specific chemo regimen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like a motorcycle start with the kind of fucked up one so youre not kicking yourself when you drop it hahahhaha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes but shes a teen she probably did not think it through in the slightest and if she did refuse then would probably be painted as a villain by everyone she knows
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is this selfish of the dude marriage is an agreement between two people you cant push the blame on one person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what kind of monster would her peers perceive her as seriously it was extremely selfish and immature of him to propose like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets hope they dont sign the official legal papers that they are married until he is healthy again because god forbid he does die those debts would be a terrible burden to live with for the rest of your life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but if they couldnt or refused then legally she would be held responsible right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like you should know the answer to this already by being on reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hahaha you arent from the us are you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah man its a sort of love not many people get to feel people like her deserve so much respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had leukemia and marrow transplant less than a year ago and i can say to you it depends there is probably a genetical predisposition to how someone reacts to the cures and this is the greatest factor in recovery and ultimately surviving i have seen many people that wanted to live with iron will many died others survived but there is in these situations and many times not only i have seen it but i have felt it that the your mental state influences the general state of health if youre depressed you wont eat you cant move you cant shake your body from the pain and thus it heals worse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i assume you know this from experience because sausagefestivities seems to have experience in this area and it would be a shame for you to be saying hes wrong if you have literally no idea what youre talking about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do you live in a hospital
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup and now she gets to be saddled with all of his medical debts until the day she dies good times good times
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boy it must feel nice to feel that loved
UpliftingNews,not_removed,graduated with the two and can confirm this theyve been a couple for a few years now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably so she doesnt get saddled with hospital debt if there is any at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gentle hugs im so sorry for the loss of your wife and mother of your children what you are going through is devastating i wish you and your children never knew this loss you are being strong for them and that is really courageous of you i know that you have said that you feel that are the worse of the two but your babies need you and they are built from your late wife i hope that next time that you are holding them tightly before bedtime that you can feel her presence in their eyes and smiles and smell of their hair and i hope that it brings you happiness and even a tiny bit of peace i know that you dont know me but im here for you if you need a friend hugs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my little sister and i lost our father to cancer he died too soon and though we are stuck with the worse of the two my sister and i still love our mother more than anything and always will she grieves in a different way than us since its a different type of relationship and seems to have moved on quickly or maybe i havent moved on soon enough i dont know but my sister and i are cut from the same cloth ad our father we have similar tendencies anger happiness gestures and oh man the stories we tell about him if you ever miss her try talking to the children and see what amazing stories theyll tell you of what they remember or even just watch them and see the things that remind you of her generally its not all sadness towards the end if you ever need to talk ill be here to listen im so very sorry for your loss
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right in the feels man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not in the same situation but husband has metastatic cancer we have been together for years married for five we have a little child i would marry him all over again knowing how his health would change hopefully he beats it but if he doesnt i know the only reason i wont end it is because of our child people tell me im strong but im not im just a mother who loves her child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is probably a shitty question and you can ignore it if youd like but i wonder very often do you feel like it was harder knowing she was dying or did it help you find closure knowing roughly how much time you had left
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpsiimgurcommpnmhfigifv
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know what else you were expecting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its ok to be a bear fucker if youre not also a bare fucker
UpliftingNews,not_removed,har
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tormund
UpliftingNews,not_removed,found turmond
UpliftingNews,not_removed,attentionbear fucker do you need assistance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my gold cherry was talking about jacking offright there with ya man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you need assistance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how has this gif not been posted yet from super troopers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,currently watching house it certainly sounds like one now that you brought it up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my first reaction as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wowyou uhdont really kid around with the whole bear thing huh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for me it was teenagers getting married part of me thought this was sweet part of me worried that this young couple could still face the problems of many young completely healthy couples who commit too early plus theres the added challenges of spouses coping with a chronic illness it was too hard for nineteen year old me to be there for my boyfriend of two years when he had a mysterious illness i stuck around too long out of guilt im hoping that this couple is so in love and so mature more than i was that they dont regret the decision even though hard times will be inevitable edit its actually not the couples decision that bothers me the most though they seem happy and i wish them continued happiness its the media and many commenters framing this situation as cute romantic and right that bothers me there will be other young couples facing this situation marriage like this will not be the best decision for all of them romanticizing an act with complicated consequences does not help them why the hell is a very individual somewhat depressing story in ruplifitingnews anyways
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hi im not the original poster but for me is difficult to accept this kind of stories without questioning if this is opportunism and even abuse back to basics is not because he is dying i need to understand that they were really in love or whatnot feel better when someone else confirms the story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he passed away tonight or as his wife says he won his battle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know how tor react to something as gutwrenching as this and i hope i never do but wow sharing this story must not have been easy thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish it wasnt true but my best friend had a girlfriend during his four year battle with cancer purely because she was such a good care taker his death ruined her emotionally and i still to this day think about how unnecessary it was she was a mutual friend of ours and we both knew she had a massive crush on him he had told me that was gay months before he asked her out it was just a couple months after his initial diagnosis and it was super obvious how one sided the relationship was it ruined her friendship with his twin and she drinks like mad its fucking sad to see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy hell that just hit me in the feels im curious about more of this story how are you now how long if at all did it take to come to terms with that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was dating this girl and i was about to undergo major surgery so we basically decided to make our relationship official and move in together well the surgery was a disaster and not only was i in serious crippling pain for over a year after but i became deeply depressed just as you began to resent your partner because of the hardship of bearing witness to someone you care about suffering for months on end so too did my partner begin to resent me it didnt help that months into my recovery she developed firbomyagia and i couldnt be there for her emotionally or physically ultimately they started cheating on me so i broke up with them persistent trauma especially the medical kind is incredibly difficult for people to deal with in relationships it isnt really a rational thing it is just an instinctual response being around somebody who is miserable all the time especially one you care about saps the joy out of life it is a matter of self preservation that people resent the victim over years later i am still dealing with my surgery results and have lost everyone in my life except my parents these kind of situations are really very tragic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think this is more common than we are led to believe everyone wants to believe in the weve been through so much but in reality sometimes thats easier to get through theres something to take your attention then when its over you wake up and notice you dont actually want to be with that person then of course theres your situation which is also very difficult
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for sharing its really difficult for loved ones to admit or even acknowledge their own conflicted feelings about caring for someone with a terminal or serious disease i definitely struggled with similar guilt when my brother died i hope youve found some peace in your life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i began to resent him quietly at first and then i began lashing out he ultimately told me he hadnt loved me in a long time he kept me around because i was good at taking care of him the truth of the human condition is so rough i wish people would get more education on this subject we are just seeing this candy coloured tv life and think that evernyone is either good or bad when in reality good and bad exist in all if us at the same time i congratulate you that you put this into words so well have an upvote

UpliftingNews,not_removed,im going to feel bad if i mixed you up with another glitter wrist but didnt you say you were a lesbian in another thread in the last hours
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy shit im sorry you are a great person i hope youre doing well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uh i would probably guess that most relationships back in the day werent exactly healthy relationships by our standards spousal abuse used to be just a thing that happened its not until recently that beating your wife wasnt seen as an acceptable thing to do not to mention arranged marriages and child marriages used to be commonstill are in some places people learned to live with it sometimes fell in love because they had to but none of that is a good basis for a healthy relationship people didnt get divorced back then because you just didnt divorcethey stayed angrily married to people they hated thats not a healthy relationship i mean im totally down for people finding their true loves early on in life thats great the thing is we now know that peoples brains arent fully formed until their midtwenties or so people change all throughout their lives sure but the most rapid change usually occurs during your younger years and due to their stillforming brains teenagers arent really well equipped to make informed decisions for those reasons its generally a bad idea to get married that young its not so much about sleeping around its about knowing what you want from your partner and making sure the person youve found can fulfill that for the next fifty years or so divorces are messy expensive and a pain in the ass to go throughyou might be saving yourself a headache if you just leave the ring out of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive no problem with young people falling in love its the idea that it has to be forever that i find stupid the person you fell in love with in your teens is not likely to be the same person or years down the line sometimes thats ok and youll love what theyve grown into sometimes you wont so by all means fall head over heels for your highschool sweetheart just maybe hold off on the lifelong commitments until youre older and maybe a little wiser
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for thousands and thousands of years humans have been mating and pairing in their teenage years and its been completely normal and produced healthy relationships and children let me correct you on one minor point for thousands and thousands of years girls were getting married in their teenage years to adult men who were probably in their or it was an arranged marriage and it was considered a healthy marriage because the women didnt complain too much because if they did they would be stoned to death a few thousand years later we progressed very far so instead of being stoned they were locked away in empty rooms alone for three months i dont think anyone is missing out so much as teenagers are stupid i say that with affection as i was once a stupid teenager and am now a marginally less stupid adult if i had married of the girls i said i loved in high school i would be so incredibly miserable right now because in hind sight they were not very awesome people then again a friend in high school married her high school sweetheart shortly after graduating and theyre still wonderfully in love i think most teenagers dont really understand what a relationship means and how to do it correctly so taking a few years to figure that out is a good idea but when youve got stage cancer as a teenager youre going to do a lot of growing up really really fast and if shes already that loyal and supportive now shes clearly pretty mature for her age so i do agree with you that these two should go for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but one minor difference medical science is whats keeping this guy alive the thousands and thousands of years prior peoples life expectancy was much much lower and didnt spend lifetime visiting doctors for terminal treatment they just died
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if relationships were so wonderful and healthy back in the day how come when it became acceptable to get divorced for the most part half of marriages ended with divorce its come down since then but only because a lot of people actually wait until theyre not naive dumb kids to get married now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for thousands of years year old guys married and fucked year olds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the problem is the economy isnt structured to support people doing that in a sane world there should be no problem with someone getting married at and finding a solid job to support the family but things are fucked these days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and you used to be able to work hours a week and support a family holy shit man get your head out of your ass i could poke holes in your whimsical gosh shucks back in the the day bullshit but i dont enjoy explaining simple shit to dummies thats why i choose not to have kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for thousands and thousands of years humans have been mating and pairing in their teenage years and its been completely normal and produced healthy relationships and children forced teenage marriages in a time where peoples life expectancy was like years old arent my definition of healthy relationships
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was my main worry with this article as happy as i am for these two i really hope it was just a ceremonial thing and they arent legally married in the eyes of the state im not sure if the debt would be passed to her but even if it wasnt theres a bunch of legal bullshit shed have to deal with if he ends up passing which it sounds like he willpoor guy on a side note im so sorry about your niece is far far too young to die im glad she still got a bit of happiness near the end however brief i hope her boyfriendhusband has fared well in life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can inherit medical debt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,considering it was less than days from the proposal to the wedding there most likely wasnt paperwork at least not beforehand most states require at least a waiting period between applying for a marriage license and performing the ceremonysigning the license
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i am not sure how they would have gotten a marriage license and all that within that short a time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at hes probably on his parents insurance which could well be good my concern would be if getting married would make him ineligible to stay on insurance as a dependent but i imagine his parents investigated that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can appreciate that i guess we just have different opinions on it there are always going to be pros and cons to each and every situation perhaps they made a bad decision perhaps they didnt only time will tell sounds to me like it helped his treatment and for me thats the biggest thing not to mention they seem to have gotten an outpouring of love and support from their community which when dealing with difficult illnesses i know first hand is important
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is she going to be any less emotionally scarred by his passing if shes only his girlfriend when he dies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly although i tend to think is a little young to marry in modern society i dont see the issue here it isnt like they just met they knew eachother for two years i also fail to see how anyone is trapped
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes dying whether or not theyre married shell be crushed in some shape or form being married doesnt make death harder or easier its still soul crushing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stipulations to you may not be stipulations to her this all comes back to opinions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read the article but whats the stipulation two people in love got married get over it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are young i met my husband when i was he was we married when i was and i was a mother at we had a second child yrs later been married for years now and still in love it can and does happen love can and does sustain a life long relationship not always sadly but it can and does happen for some fortunate people like us for instance i wish them well i hope he will be able to heal i hope their love sustains them to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health until death do they part
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats really fucking dark but i laughed so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im dying laughing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can call him selfish and still lay blame on both of them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,only if its in a community property state and that danger can usually be mitigated though a prenuptial agreement in most states including oklahoma where the story is debts incurred by one spouse arent owed by the other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that sucks that people have to be so judgemental about two people they dont know just because it isnt right for the person reading the story doesnt mean it isnt right for the people in the story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont actually live in one but spent the better part of four years in one due to chronic pancreatitis mainly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha and even if he survives chances are shell grow to resent him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i was laughing at something else great idea though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my daughter reminds me of her so much its not even funny she is the spitting image of my wife and my sister combined she even has some of her mannerisms perhaps your mother has bottled it up or believes she needs to outwardly project strength for you at the time i would try to be strong for our children but after they had gone to bed and were sleeping id to go the back of the house and cry like it was going out of fashion i guess it helped since im still here dont judge her too harshly its a difficult thing to lose the person you loved and chose out of everyone else in the world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i deluded myself into thinking she would get better i was certain that she would beat it and actively passed on this delusion to her when she would say she didnt want to go to chemo this week or she wasnt feeling good i knew she would beat it when the first chemo failed and they moved her to another combination i knew that would work and she would be completely fine one day i was with her in her hospital room and i found a note on her desk presumably written by a doctor or nurse it simply said hospice on it i saw it and it was kinda one of those moments where the world stops around you and you zoom in and out at the same time at that moment i realised that things were not working out and she was not going to win she was gone within a month
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man what fucking movie is that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres my risky click of the day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,risky click of the day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats disgusting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,guess you werent so lucky this time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well chances are this wont be a very long commitment im just saying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its been over a year since i left my ex and its absolutely still hard to think about for those who didnt catch the comment i replied to they were describing the dedication of the young girl in the op saying her selflessness in her now husbands time of need shows her true love for him her acts of devotion paralleled mine closely and i wanted to share a different perspective
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats absolutely horrible if i may ask why didnt anyone say anything if they knew the relationship was onesided i wouldve done anything for someone to drag me out of the hospital for my own good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tldr im okay but im not even close to coming to terms with it i lived in the hospital when my ex was a patient then moved into his parents place to work as his caregiver after his release from the hospital didnt have anywhere else to go after the breakup that was substantial from the start of living in the hospital to now ive been homeless i slept on my parents couch for a while then after i met my current partner i stayed more nights at his place then his family offered a spare room but they could only afford to pay for my foodutilities for so long now ive been living in a shelter for a bit over a month work has been spotty but im finally settling down with a decent food service job training to be a manager which is tough it pays well though and when i leave my shelter program next year i should be able to support myself still paying off medical debt my ex said he would cover it was for therapy sessions mental health wise eh got diagnosed with severe depression chronic anxiety and ptsd im kind of a mess sometimes lately ive been plagued with nightmares and my memory hasnt been worth much working with my therapist to get me on medication which i definitely need current romantic partner and i have been together for almost a year now i snapped into another relationship fast after my ex and i broke things off but it turned out just fine him and his family have been nothing but welcoming and generous i think ill turn out okay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im so sorry to hear how things turned out for you my heart goes out to you it really does
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sometimes its hard to recognize that going through so much can lead to burn out absolutely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have found a lot of peace im with someone new and im working on living a balanced life and taking care of myself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i nearly asked my highschool sweetheart to marry me and holy shit am i glad i didnt and years later were still friends and i love her to death but damn im so glad we broke up then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this wasnt the case for most of recorded history typically you worked on the family farm or basically as sharecropper maybe in a guildapprenticeship the period of time when you got married at and got a well paying job was very brief the average marrying age even in colonial us was a lot higher if youre angry about this be angry at at will work states
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you she was a good kid and gone too soon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when my grandfather died i know that my family kept getting calls from bill collectors about his debts but we just ignored them and eventually they stopped
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well a person or their estate is responsible for all debts in most cases they take out the debts from the estate and if anything is left over it goes to the heirs if the debt is bigger than the estate then typically the matter just ends but in situations in which the deceased was receiving government medical benefits the government can and has sought repayment from relatives beyond whatever estate the deceased left httpsenwikipediaorgwikifilialresponsibilitylaws
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is exactly what i was thinking there was another post recently that was talking about not wanting to marry their fiancé due to the fact they would assume their debt after death maybe just have the ceremony and not the legal marriage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a spouse can not another family member
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think this is true the estate of the deceased owns the debt if you have shared assetsdebts housemortgage then of course you have to worry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre married it depends on the state
UpliftingNews,not_removed,only from a spouse or child not from a parent or otherwise next of kin you can also choose to pay their medical bills while they are alive which would stick you with the bill afterwards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if state law allows for necessaries to become the obligation of the spouse where there is no payment and attempts have been fruitless yes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh yeah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i also feel like any insurance agency that booted him would immediately feel fire from hell climbing up their legs sure theres probably an automated system that would flag it and send a message you just got married etc but i would sincerely hope that all it would take is one phone call from the parents hes dying of cancer and married his sweetheart because hes dying of cancer please kindly continue to let our insurance cover him or please kindly go fuck yourself with a broken lightbulb make sure its still plugged in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she didnt even mention the sex hes married so he gets hospital sex that would put me in remission too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it makes the journey of the one passing away a little sweeter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,met my wife when we were both married at we celebrate years of marriage in december we have four biological kids and two adopted children true love doesnt fade
UpliftingNews,not_removed,started dating my wife who was when i was now im and just celebrated my anniversary everyone online thinks they know better than everyone else they should all just fuck off and live their own lives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,married at the same ages with out being a mother yet and we are going on years you are absolutely right with the right mature view of marriage it can work out and has
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i met my hubby when i was and he was we were married a year later years later were still married weve had ups and downs but thats part of growing up and you never stop doing that theres no magical point in time when you can say yep ok im old enough to get married im about as mature as im ever going to be and my personality is fixed like a rock i can make a lifelong commitment with absolute certainty yay married at married at whatever same difference years from now you will be different people no matter what age you are when you say i do good on you for your years heres to manymanymany more years of happiness for you two
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you arent wrong as i said i want them to make something of it and succeed but its a very hard position for them to be in all the best to them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i want this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fair enough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yah lol i got the joke too i just felt like pointing it out anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre more than welcome and i meant what i wrote you even if its just to vent or if one of your babies is a daughter and you have a question about puberty or whatever girl stuff feel free message me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats hamlet with kenneth branagh heres the actual scene
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hamlet but thats not the original text obviously its but less common than the navy seal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,remindme days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,birds of a feather i guess do you also have a skin infection
UpliftingNews,not_removed,something about nuts or whatever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah who would fuck an anim wait
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh i agree and hate that i also thought well maybe there wont be that set of long term consequences at least
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think with young couples especially young women its important to learn the difference between devotion and codependency being there isnt healthy for either party she needs to continue to experience life and grow while hes in the hospital even if it seems unloving her identity shouldnt revolve around him and his situation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks a lot i totally agree people really push this love stories a little bit too much hope you will feel relieved soon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow i totally feel you on the medical debt when my partner developed fibromyalgia while i was recovering from major surgery gone wrong i payed for all of their treatment and other needs they promised they would pay me back but then they were fired over their medical issues then we broke up im still recovering from the surgery i had over years ago and am preparing to undergo another surgery in a few months and im now unemployed living in a spare room at my parents house all told i am saddled with about in debt that i cant repay as a direct result of my ex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this might not be of any comfort to you but your shitty ex will get what he deserves i fully believe in karma because i have witnessed it in my own life enough times in situations like this my father had a saying that went something along the lines of wait and itll fall in your lap your ex was a coldhearted user and that kind of person eventually gets back what they gave to the world youll get your life together start excelling and enjoy a fulfilling relationship and his life at some point will just fall apart around him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,debts dont get passed down through generations in the vast majority of circumstances but are shared in a marriage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,once a company finds out their customer has passed on or they see a notice in the paper they will want to enter their debt into the estate so they can be paid through probate that would be my guess as to why you were receiving calls i believe a spouse inheriting debt depends on the state laws
UpliftingNews,not_removed,debt collectors will try to collect even if they dont have legal grounds for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fascinating ill follow that link when i get home thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay that made me laugh thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if hes so sick that he cant stand up to get married i doubt his dick can get hard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,remission emissions the nutsack story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh my you have a big family congratulations you are correct true love doesnt fade well said i wish you all long lives health happiness and much love take care nana internet hug
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great perspective i wish you both long lives health happiness and of course ongoing devotion and love nana internet hug

UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree throws rose petals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope you find it its the best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not op but youre an awesome individual no matter what please dont change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jesus thats a fucked up copy pasta
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of days to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hamlet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,squirrels are the only ones who enjoy my nuts just ask your mother
UpliftingNews,not_removed,absolutely i had such a hard time leaving the hospital building even for just half an hour to grab some quick food with a friend i felt like if i left i wouldnt look like a caring partner or god forbid the moment i left would be when something bad would happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wouldve told her she shouldnt be taking care of him if he needed someone to care for him that much theres always caregivers and in home nurses theres no reason to ruin someone for the sake of convenience
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shit man im so sorry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can i ask what kind of medical treatment your ex was receiving for fibromyalgia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for what its worth i dont think he was shitty or cold hearted id bet a decent chunk of money on that he was dealing with the same issue i was how to break off a now awful relationship after crossing what seemed like a point of no return getting engaged there was an unbearable amount of pressure on us to throw an engagement party to get the local news involved have a gorgeous beach wedding the works not to mention i didnt have anywhere to live if i didnt stay with him it was messy and we both kept the relationship going far longer than we should have
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i recall reading somewhere that only new debts established after marriage are shared was that incorrect or is it a perstate thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really i remember when my grandad had a heart attack in fl and had to be flown to a hospital near us in canada after he died my aunt and mom were hit with crazy medical bills from the states when his insurance wouldnt cover it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do you have to shit on my happy fucking ending
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks so much and to you as well the overwhelming cynicism around here gets depressing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,welp glad yall are in the loop because i have no idea what just happened here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats such a kind thing to say thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and you call yourself a bear fucker and have never even heard of it you disgust me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats the case in community property states arizona california idaho louisiana nevada new mexico texas washington and wisconsin in common law states the debt is the responsibility of the person who incurred it regardless of marital status except if the debt is from a joint account so if theyre in a community property state its a bad idea to legally get married if its a terminal diagnosis even if theyre not expected to live more than a few days a day in the hospital with a terminal illness tends to be super expensive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did they take advice about if they actually had to pay them thats different generation and country it would seem unenforceable at a guess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some folks are going through rough patches im doing okay so i might as well be positive than not a better man than i once said dont worry be happy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he wasnt kidding not only op but your comment as well made my eyes water thats coming from someone who doesnt often shed a tear you and op are really awesome people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i disgust myself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the fact that he felt this was needed is the opposite of uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its incredible what he has done but it is kind of sad at same time that someone his age built something to protect himself and his friends rather than being able to be free and play
UpliftingNews,not_removed,about goddamn time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if they were donated erectile dysfunctional drugs it would save many endangered species the belief that certain animal parts make men randy has led to the demise of vast herds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because they cant stop cold turkey gotta wean themselves off of it give me a break
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they arent gonna stop shit are you kidding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tiger penises ox penises bear paws fermented snake baijiu liquor yeah chinese herbal medicine is weird
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that dude at the end with the dog who steps to the cop would have gotten shot in the us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,give him a free vacation to the us and let him try again edit also this isnt uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the cynical part of me thinks this was obviously carried out with an eye on getting recognition for it the practical part of me is like homeless people can actually be bad for business and cause various other inconveniences to business owners they arent responsible for taking care of the homeless it might be nice if they did but you shouldnt force them to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,with all that effort she should have invited the homeless to her home
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this mom is not a hero the businesses have a right to do what they wanted w their property how would she feel if they set up signs in lieu of the spikes that said food and lodging available at
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not sure how many are aware but it fucking rains in manchester relentlessly about as much use as an ashtray on a motorbike
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah lets see her set one of those up outside her house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whoever owns the building is gonna end this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the next generation antihomeless spikes will be super heated to melt away any cushions or homeless we apologize to our shareholders for the defect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its definitely more symbolic than practical theres a huge homeless problem in manchester and its nice for them to feel like everybody isnt against them when the council is putting up spikes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not talking about this story specifically since i dont have all the details what i learned from living in the city is most homeless people sleep by businesses only at night after business hours also business owners can easily get them arrested if they sleep on their properties homeless people normally dont sleep on business properties business owners just lobby the city to install the spikes or get a permit to do so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe she did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe she did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never had vegemite before how is it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you clearly didnt research the subject or looked at statistics in america alone at least homeless veterans million children homeless dont use drugs and most of started taking drugs after homelessness or forced to yes some gangs force disadvantaged people to take drugs to get people addicted medical bills are the biggest cause of us bankruptcies most adult homeless had full time jobs and lost it not by choice health reasons layoffs mental illness major accidents disability domestic violence fire hurricane not finding jobhousing after having a permanent record of a minor crime housing crisis corporate scams divorce stupid judgeslandlord foreclosure real estate scams one advice stop being ignorant and stop being an asshole assumptions are your worse enemy and karma is a bitch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i live in manchester so im aware of how deep the problem goes and that it cant be solved by putting cushions on street corners but the homeless community here is quite marginalised and they feel like theyre quite discriminated against source is the ark manchester so its uplifting to me that a member of the public made this visible gesture of humanity toward them especiallly in face of the quite cold and dehumanising imo way of treating them the same way we treat pigeons roosting in inconvenient places
UpliftingNews,not_removed,covering the spikes is a solidarity gesture its a meaningful one installing the spikes shows a terrible understanding of the problem it does nothing to resolve it and in fact represents spending money on a nonresolution that also dehumanizes those suffering in already inhuman conditions the money for the spikes could have housed a few people for a few days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so any charity you do you post it on fb twitter instagram and on the news and how do you know her fb twitter and instagram to know this much about her either you are a creep or you have personal problem with her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,covering the spikes is a solidarity gesture its a meaningful one that is easy to say in your warm home behind your nice safe computer if youre out in the cold world faced with literal concrete reality it is an entirely different world they face mental illness depression violence and poverty that keeps some homeless for decades they dont need empty gestures they need homes healthcare and actual help if these people cared as much as they say the first step is a soup kitchen donating toiletries including toilet paper and tampons to shelters and everything that doesnt get news attention the people that put up the spikes are no more responsible for homelessness than you are they are just disproportionately impacted by the effects such as public defecation making them an easy target for online shaming you get hyperbolic statements like the money for the spikes could have housed a few people for a few days tldr until we all accept personal direct responsibility for the problem there is no hope of solving it keyboard warriors and solidarity gestures wont solve it by shaming businesses it requires actual hard work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,internet stranger i realize you mean well but you havent got the faintest foggiest idea what i do when im not safely behind my keyboard dont presume to know thanks i have debrided way way too many urine soaked foot wounds to listen to someone who thinks i dont know anything about homelessness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow great story id let her zap me with it to if it brought a smile to her face
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not what i expected just going off the title i was surprised the teen even survived but its actually a nice story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,clickbait spam from the wittyfeedcom spammers dont waste your time is a spam report
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in the article it looks like they are saying its increasing not really a good thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant imagine this being uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,misleading title since they arent her emails
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant imagine where the upcoming leaks will come from wikileaks or the fbi
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they came from her top aide weiner but seriously feds get your shit together
UpliftingNews,not_removed,perfect timing for crooked hillary because when she wins the election she will be immune to all charges httpsenwikipediaorgwikiexecutiveprivilege
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it may be time to make mandatory execution sentences for corrupt politicians and law enforcement and amend a way for popular vote to superceed the authority of the existing branches
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree that it needs to happen but i guess uplifting means something different to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,from the mainstreaming of electricity to the wide spread use of the internet from horses to space ships from billion people to billion from farms to skyscrapers emma morano you have seen it all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can only hope that ill look that good at more likely ill be half decomposed by then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she has earned the title spartan now ok in all seriousness that is amazing she has lived through the most world changing century ever excluding when the meteors hit earth and killed the dinosaurs it must be amazing to have seen this she has lived though some amazing horrible and interesting times both world wars people on the moon cars and electricity everywhere think about it she is old enough to have been in the wild west and going into space if she wanted to thats wild
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i give my employees water no bread just water dont want to spoil the proletariat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,americans made me a rich man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah we were all sad when he was dronei mean done
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he had no where to go but upso of course hes a better man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unfortunately the same cant be said for the nation as a whole if it was trump never would have been elected
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wasnt the use of drones the alternative to troops on the ground would you have preferred sending thousands of troops into these countries honest question
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres something about tribalism that is very powerful most republicans will vote for whomever is representing them and the same for democrats no matter who
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes drone are much more efficient at bombing an entire wedding party and making sure every last child is dead thanks obama
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good point drones made it much more cost efficient to bomb doctors without borders
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i just find it funny and ironic that he has a nobel peace prize
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you want joe biden in this thread because this is how you get joe biden in this thread also joe wants some thanks too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,none of the congressmen live along the mississippi river of course they dont care if its dirtytoxichas bodies floating around seriously though this guy is awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httplivinglandsandwatersorgaboutusmeetchad we need to get mr trash wheel and this guy together httpbaltimorewaterfrontcomhealthyharborwaterwheel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a fucking legend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why why why do so many people throw tires into the rivers it makes absolutely no sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,congrats too bad someone rolled back regulations so companies can dump their waste right back in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course not i wonder if we called on congress to pollute the mississippi would they then clean it up since they usually do the opposite of the right thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for real i was thinking the same thing that way the community can get the stuff that the wheels cant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is not the breed of dog i expected the picture to be of either its a secret road warrior or it was significantly helped with its travel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is great cant imagine being without our pets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant see the picture when i click on the article can someone post a link please
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems like a pretty good idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is excellent many young people are too selfconscious to seek out help for a problem they dont understand if the help comes to them it could be very effective good for ireland
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats wonderful so many people suffer not just from mental illness but lacking coping skills this is definitely a need in the usa not just ireland
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how in the heck are they going to fit in hours thats insane kids already dont have enough free time to enjoy while i agree that it sounds good i dont see how they can possibly accomplish this without it being an unreasonable burden
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thatd drive me nuts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,skip the class and give em a pint
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we have a really bad issue with suicide here in ireland so yes long overdue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,totally agree its hard to even recognise you have a problem let alone be brave enough to ask for help really proud of our little island for launching this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we need to prepare these people for work not for triggering and safe spaces 🤦‍♂️ i dont hold much hope for the next generation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as an irish student this isnt going to do much classes like this cspe sphe religon arent taking seriously anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im just unclear on how they plan to fit it in its still another course that students have to take i actually read through a few articles and im not entirely clear on it because they keep saying hours during their teens but give age groups outside that range this would be great if they could find another class to replace it with and i hope they keep that in mind when trying to roll this out if they really want to help with mental health for people still in primary education they need to cut down the stress caused by school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah good magachoochoos comment got deleted what is with the trump lovers who go into the nice forums and try to ruin it i may be a dick but i respect the subs that are for being nicer to one another i just dont get what the trump lovers get out of being shitty to people who are only being nice to one another and i say that as someone who is a dick much of the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sometimes you dont realise the imprint of a class for example i didnt realise when i was studying irish how it would impact later in life it wasnt of value necessarily ie it didnt help me get a job but as i travelled the world i realised how precious it was to have a language try keep an open mind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats trump got to do with anything this is an open discussion about over or under use of support systems or so i thought
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well put in addition the benefits of education of all types often are overlooked during the period of study in some cases we can go our most of our lives without realizing the beneifts whether it be the use and ease of applying simple mathematics proper use of language and in the case of mental health being aware of your own state of mind and that of those around you education is a funny thing in that way it is easy to tell when someone is lacking much harder to gauge how much it has improved their quality of life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the discourse here is helping no one can we all just let each other be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think reddit can help link to httpswwwfacebookcomdanawrightkmbz and full story posted on top of local radio hosts facebook
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i made it without the help of others he will be stronger when he gets older being independent and not worrying about others helps make you a go getter and not a slap dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i made it without the help of others he will be stronger when he gets older being independent and not worrying about others helps make you a go getter and not a slap dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this title is so clickbaitey
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am a wedding photographer and i do not have pictures of our wedding the irony right we moved from the us to germany and had the pictures on photobucket the account got hacked and we lost our pictures since we had no guests at the weeding just me and my wife and a clerk we got noting from that day but we have each other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is also a great example of how connected the global community is love is able to touch everyone who sees it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aww thats touching but i like the part where u said you have each other thats more important and by the way it seems a lot of photographers usually dont take care of their own photographs and thats if they even remember to take photographs of themselves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,said it were €
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in cash in the bank account booksmoney in the bank
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks i should have read the article before complaining
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uplifting news for us but terrrible news for anyone in indianapolis that wanted to adopt a pet but couldnt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not the only animal shelter in indianapolis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his religions pros returning money to its rightful owner cons
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fake pro refugee propaganda after brexit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hot cop and cute pup
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it mean to point out that the pup was returned to her owner so she could be sold not that there is anything wrong with that but its not like she was a beloved family pet she was more like stolen merchandise still good job finding and arresting the robbers and returning the mans property
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they wanted to sell that cute thing off on craigslist the side facts on this subreddit is sometimes not so uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i misread the title at first i thought a recover puppy that worked for the police department was stolen whew like a puppy being trained for recovery stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cop looks like seth mcfarlane
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that pup has seen some shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,keanu true life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so keanu
UpliftingNews,not_removed,john wick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry but dumbass running a puppy mill out of his house had it coming these breeders do nothing but bring pain to the world please adopt from a shelter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like uplifting news as long as you dont read into the violent robbery part we recovered the dog and will be returning it to its owners as soon as we find the next of kin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a hottie the cop id play with his baton any day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lolz ikr i live in the areaeveryone there be making me feel ugly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is totally something wrong with selling animals especially via craigslist unless youre selling huskies as working dogs i dont really see the point in breeding more dogs when theres thousands dying in shelters to want a dogs like that just because it looks cool or you like the personality is dumb af
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea that definitely ruined the story for me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree im glad the dudes were both arrested and the owner is ok but hes just gonna turn around and sell that puppy to someone else its not like he was reunited with a beloved family pet i dont necessarily have it out for breeders but i do think that intentional breedingselling of animals on craigslist is a huge problem you know the owner called that an adoption fee again not blaming him at all for the robbery i just think whoever wrote this article from the perspective of a reunion is seeing it through rose colored glasses
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly fuck that guy and his shitty puppy mill
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uh the owner survived the attack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,saaaaaaame one of the things i hate about visiting home
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everyone in san jose is hot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because people are obsessed with the look of huskies and its becoming horrible for the breed people who should never own them buy them because they are cute and omg they look like a wolf dont i look so tough with my cute wolf theyre not fucking accessories theyre very intelligent working dogs as you mentioned and need a very specific and patient owner or they will misbehave as adults abandoned and eventually euthanized because no one wants a dog thats never been socialized is aggressive even out of pure fear or chews on everything because their previous owner fucked them up during their most important learning stage puppy on top of that this person was literally about to sell this poor puppy to someone that has no problem with smashing another person with a blunt object and tazering them this dog would have been severely abused in their care but who who gives a shit the owner would have gotten money right who cares about screening or finding the right home when its all about the mighty dollar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no lol source my fam lives there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hahahahahahahaha holy shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that picture makes it look like the little girl is the man who had the heart attack oddly enough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,weird title
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is this uplifting this is terrible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that garage sale sign though seems like someone didnt get the memo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am all for people being happy but i just dont understand it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you actually read the article though this person went though a lot of gender confusion both mentally and physically in their life the article explains her odd circumstances very well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when you have no real issues in your life you have to makeup things that are wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you understand thats its ok for you not to understand where is it written that you have to understand every choice every person in existence chooses see if we were all the same it would be boring its our difference that makes our individual choices unique blessings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you should look into intersex issues there are some interesting bloggers and youtubers out there who explain the problems intersex people face and why an intersex birth certificate is so important
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we humanity are expanding into the idea the truth that we are more than our bodies we are actually spirits having a human experience spirits have no gender so a masculine spirit can incarnate into a female body so now we reask the question is this male in a female body male or female we see that we had only boxes but the universes is unlimited it has infinite boxes humanity only had see so now in our expanded awareness we see that we need another box for those that are ready for this other box see you can still check whatever box you choose to does not change you blessings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i did read the article her circumstances makes sense seems like there was lots of funny business i read in babies are born with ambiguous genitalia seems like if it was some common and such an issue you hear about it all the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she couldnt achieve puberty naturally because her body didnt produce the nessicary hormones and had to get surgery at for it that would be a pretty real issue for anyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,understand every choice every person in existence chooses you sound delusional and i dont think you fully grasp the content of the article let me summarize it for you sara kelly keenan was born with sexual characteristics of both genders male chromosomes female external genitalia both male and femal internal reproductive organs and finally got a certificate that states that i am glad it happened as i think its the right thing to do this has nothing to do with malcom x gandhi reincarnation expanded universe lifestyle choices and the like its a certificate stating what was the status at birth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i thought it only important if i understood it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who is the best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant help but notice how insane this sounds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think you fully understand what the article is about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sexing the body is a great book about this issue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think i got this question mixed up with another question so i believe you are correct
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the difference between profound and insane belief malcolmn x was insane to those that did not believe same with ghandi and martin luther king imagine a skinny indian man standing up to the british empire the military governor said to ghandi what do you expect to gain from this do you believe the british army and all its might is just going to march out of india because you say so and ghandi said yes that is exactly what i believe years later the british army and all its might marched out of india now i ask you was ghandis statement profound or insane when he said it it all depends on the belief does it not time will tell but please note that people are being issued bcs with options some say insane non believers or judgment givers and others say profound allowers blessings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think i got this question mixed up with another question so you may be right remember we just get a notification of a response in our mailboxes and we can not see the original question so accidents happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,np apologies for sounding like a ahole
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats awesome

UpliftingNews,not_removed,poor dog
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the rarest pupper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is sad to see all the dislikes this already has the amount of hate and vitriol that has been stirred up is terrifying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read it as protestors protest muslim immigrants holding prayers at dia and wondered why this was in rupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a crosspost from rnottheonion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,from the article vauxhall has said it is considering renaming the colour of the yellow corsa to maddox yellow in support of the pensioner thatd be the uplifting frosting on the cake
UpliftingNews,not_removed,were those onion flowers she brought her making my eyes water something fierce
UpliftingNews,not_removed,such a beautiful story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow years of birthday presents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he prepared a lot for that really cares about what hes doing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love how one of the students gets up and walks out of the way through well since we arent doing maths today
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that girl who packs up and leaves before the end wtf
UpliftingNews,not_removed,link to the video
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is this a legitimate news source because they wrote threw instead of through like a year old
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his previous april first videos are pretty hilarious too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is amazing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,please summarize as i dont want to fill out a survey to read this article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do the british pluralize math
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was never good at maths maths
UpliftingNews,not_removed,brilliant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats actually really cool good on him for enjoying what he does and wanting to make his class interesting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im so glad i watched this wow how creative and fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this site requires filling out a survey or some such idiocy to read the content
UpliftingNews,not_removed,should stop teaching math and start teaching video editing and graphic design
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that title is so click baity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this guy is great
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this was uplifting thanks for sharing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt learn much math there did i miss something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youll never guess why
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel bs who has class on saturdays
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someones been watching gertie the dinosaur and jurassic park well hello there john
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what did the englishes and histories teachers provide didnt they thoreau globseses and bookseses precious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did i see a girl stood up and left in middle of this ungrateful bitch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,math teacher named matthew
UpliftingNews,not_removed,remindme year april fools
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is uplifting news uh k
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a tenure must be like cake and candy everyday
UpliftingNews,not_removed,another poorly written article the light saber was thrown through the screen not threw
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can someone save me a click
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it wasnt most genius at all you buzzfeed titlewritibg asshole
UpliftingNews,not_removed,american accent makes him a math teacher
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant decide if im downvoting this for the clickbait title or the april stupidity but im downvoting it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this prankjoke has been done a bunch of times by other professors he put in some effort but is still a hack and ripping off older material
UpliftingNews,not_removed,iirc this teacher is pretty famous for doing something similarly brilliant for april fools every year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that made me irrationally angry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she probably has work or another class right after this one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably its because its at least the time hes done this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol maths
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe he was going over time and she had places to be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe they got some bad news right before class didnt want to miss class but wasnt in the right head space to be around jovial people recognizing this they removed themselves from the situation rather than lash out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his previous april first videos are pretty hilarious too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im guessinghoping nonnative speaker based on the other errors
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was able to read it without any hassle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mathematics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,british ie reeeeeee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in greek the word is mathematica in greek if a word had a at the end then it would generally be plural kinda like how we have s at the end of words to signify plurals so we translate it as mathematics and shorten to maths but you know american exceptionalism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,with the s it also fits with stats which is short for statistics on both sides of the pond that said i really cant stand it and i wish theyd stop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is no plural of maths maths is short for mathematics which is also not plural why do americans remove letters for no reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it does i was able to read it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maths please dont insult the integrity of this redditor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of year april fools to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dfpmjen dont forget to add the time options after the of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he threw it thru the screen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,teacher brought in fake protractors made everyone draw barack obama with boobies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man dont ruin our uplifting news buzz youre such a killjoy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats one way to get students signed up for your class and ensure theyre there for at least one day out of the yearsemester whats he do when april falls on a saturday or sunday kind of sad to think there wont be a joke from him next year just because its the weekend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe sitting in on a irrational numbers lecture might help
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know i was like is this bitch serious right now ungrateful cunt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know mathematics the plural of mathematic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get out of here with your reason and empathy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a high school teacher the kind of students who dont appreciate fun thingseffort put in by the teacher are the same ones failing she probably doesnt like the professor because she blames him for her poor grade and is not willing to allow her perception of him to change by having a positive experience
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bingcom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,weird summary but okay thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy shit im an idiot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that still doesnt dont make sense mathematics isnt plural you know how you know that even brits say maths is not maths are and both say mathematics is heres a linguist talking about it httpsyoutubesbzcecvoata
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what other words are abbreviated by arbitrarily taking the inner parts of the spelling out it would be like spelling he word recap recapitulate to recapate or recape theres no logical or linguistic reason to keep the s on math from mathematics when truncating the word
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpwwwdailywritingtipscompluralbutsingularinconstruction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,none of what you mentioned makes the word mathematics plural i fail to see how this is american exceptionalism its just a few people wondering why english breaks yet another rule
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we are just more efficient why remove just letters when you can remove s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpwwwdailywritingtipscompluralbutsingularinconstruction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,april fools hahahaha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damnit i finally watched this and thats not at all what happened bamboozled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats he do when april falls on a saturday did you see the video because thats what he did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its saturday rn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre at about an right now and im gonna need you to take it back to about a take a couple of deep breaths
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i went to uni with a girl who would always leave in the middle of lectures sometimes at the coolest most interesting most inspirational bits everyone thought she was a snob and thought she was better than everyone else she even just stopped turning up at all eventually turns out she had ulcerative colitis and is scheduled to have her intestine removed she was reay sick and embarrassed aboutit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its called math not maths or mathematic goddamn brits we defeated your country in fair battle and now we have the right to determine proper pluralizations edit downvote me all you want it still wont unlose the revolutionary war for you usa usa usa usa
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a lot of assumptions youre making mate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you sound like you kind of suck as a high school teacher if youre making assumptions about students without knowing their home life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love you too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah i didnt get the correlation for a long time myself then again maybe were both idiots 🤔
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its okay my friend had told my why revive is abbreviated to rez in games and i still cant remember
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that still doesnt dont make sense are you sure youre one to talk about stuff making sense p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,news united states data httpwwwdailywritingtipscompluralbutsingularinconstruction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpwwwdailywritingtipscompluralbutsingularinconstruction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know this is a pretty old comment and youve all probably moved on but the way i understand it is as such mathematics is short for the study of mathematics ie multiple rules of numbers hence the plural however in normal conversation we are referring to the the study of maths ie one school of study hence the singular however this is just one reason and as much as some people might not like it language evolves with how people speak it and not exact rules or definitions i dont think either is right but it is an interesting study in the development of language
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i get the case for pronunciation being confusing with the root word lpronounce but ths as in paths
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not all the way and i really havent slept since thursday so after i woke up from what sleep i got early this morning i was thinking today was now sunday because everyone who gets april before us does all their fools and jokes earlier its a confusing time okay and i feel like a sleep deprived idiot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so the maths shows up in the comments i cant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he could be an australian
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not a plural maths is singular its just a field like physics or as americans would say physic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe if americans cut down on the supersized fast food instead of the s in maths
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah seriously a lot of these comments seem to be from people who have never been to university people leave lectures early all the time whether its because they have another class on a different campus or maybe a medical condition that requires unpredictable toilet stops its just something that happens nobody cares or makes a fuss the point being its a shame to see all these commenters getting so worked up about a girl leaving instead of just enjoying the light hearted prank as intended i bet the lecturer didnt give it a second thought
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its no more than anyone else is making mine however is based off of experience having been both to university and working as a teacher myself im not saying im correct but is an absolutely valid possibility
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually i know the situation of almost every one of my students its a point we emphasize at our school lets also recognize youre making assumptions about my ability without knowing any information about me edit thanks for the down votes on caring and knowing my students
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fair point fortunately i provided a reference so my own credibility isnt relevant p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is that relevant that doesnt mean everything they collectively decide is by definition logical like every language english has certain rules and a whole lot of exceptions which dont follow the internal logic of the language maths is an example that doesnt follow their own logic the argument in favor of maths is that it is logical because mathematics is plural and so the abbreviation should be plural but mathematics isnt plural according to its modern for the last years usage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the th in paths is vocalized for my american accent but i hear maths with an un vocalized th fwiw
UpliftingNews,not_removed,april fools its actually april
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh boy ive had it up to here with you snarky biscuit munchers america invented math and english we will do what we please
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe if you cut down on your being a stupid pie e of shit people wouldnt think so lowly of you fuck you pussy keep chasing the dollat you stupid fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol because were fat we will sit on you damn redcoats
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuuuuuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you really vocalize the th in math im canadian and say math out if habit but ive never heard the th vocalized
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had to not only double check my computers calendar i turned on the tv to check the date the guide says it is thanks haha everyone needs a little gas lighting every now and then right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey its you again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that everything they decide is by definition illogical youre losing me here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i dont which was my point i wasnt clear about what i meant but because i vocalize the th in paths but often hear brits australians say maths with an unvocalized th it isnt the same sound in fact if i were to say maths i would probably not vocalize the th
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hows it been
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i see i was trying actually and i find it difficult to vocalize the th in paths even when consciously trying i just end up extending the vocalized a speaking is fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty good mate hbu
UpliftingNews,not_removed,been good been good are you still a stupid dumbfuck bitch yhese days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah more or less my dude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for being a good sport have a nice remainder of your weekend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you too pal dont be too much of a kickass this sunday
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this happened in one of my classes it was really distracting and no one got any work done people who didnt belong in the room were coming in just to see the baby another student had requested the same thing the semester before and was denied which led to her dropping out so the decision caused a lot of unnecessary drama and resentment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as long as she removes her baby when they cry i would have zero problem with this ive got two right now under
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is this actually uplifting news i think it sounds like a bad idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in a world of distractions with smartphones and employees having to work in small cubicles side by side the teacher is just preparing everyone for the reality of their future
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i literally just saw the same thing last week but the teacher was black and the post said lets pretend this teacher is white and give him the same fame he would get if he was white lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the biggest thing as long as its not hampering the ability of the other students to learn theres no problem when it starts to get in the way of the other students learning experience is the only time id have a problem with something like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you seem like that one person everyone cant wait to work with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats one of the things i liked about the story it sounds like the mom has brought the baby only a few times and that he hasnt been disruptive so not only what the teacher did was cool the mom has been thoughtful by not taking advantage of the teachers kindness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is what we need way more of i wish we saw more of this this story made me happy and hopeful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,amen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but who gets his job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow makes you think about judging people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the ghost janitor of course
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what if that fails and we have another million infected insects
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the topic was discussed at latest the wan show by linus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they cant afford drugs while living at their millennial parents parents house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what you said parents twice and forgot an apostrophe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he may or may not be stoned i dunno just a guess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know about you but i gotthard just looking at it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it your mom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont kid yourself you wouldnt touch the sides

UpliftingNews,not_removed,in years hell be telling his kids who want a car that he walked hours to work when he was their age and theyll think hes exaggerating
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that bike will make all the difference to that lad kudoes to the folks who saw the need and filled it with something meaningful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,black man ✓ bike✓ police stop✓ yep he definitely wont be walking to work any more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aw right bpd local boys done good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why didnt they just pay for his car to be fixed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awesome stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great gesture from the police
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like a good kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh cool end but he still got stopped for no reason rudeinvasive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and this is how you end bigotted views of your race well played good hard working sir
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is a hint there that he got stopped for being a lone black male perhaps all the praise and the bike are overcompensation for the white cops guilt but hey it all counts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and this is how you end bigoted views of your profession
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bullshit that the state profits off this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sure that people who arent rich would appreciate it paying a fine can be a nightmare if youre poor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,definitely the actress from divergent that got arrested there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually most succeed when many different socioeconomic groups find themselves allied and communicate for a greater cause than just their own class
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it actually is good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but this shows that someone cared enough to donate million to free these people it also gives their cause more attention plus no one with any brain is going to expect someone to bail them out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if people expect it theyre idiots
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this allows people to keep protesting if they so choose it also gets people back to their homes to their families and back to their jobs jail time is damaging if you cant get out and while i dont know specifics of the people in jail i think it was an act of kindness the motive would be unclear to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but still a great fucking story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shes being too hard on herself and the other executives theyre not massive hacks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,chicago did this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont support general blanket bans for plastic bags because theres nothing special about them compared to other trash if trash collection works and there is enough natural growth to bury litter like this but in rocky deserts once a plastic bag is thrown on the ground its not going anywhere in the canaries theres a stretch of desert where the whole floor is littered with plastic bags thrown by wind from a nearby city so a ban makes sense for a place like morocco
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mom i just got blown up ive never heard anything as casual as that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ohhh thats how you get a girlfriend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hollywood movie incoming
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy shit that is an amazing how i met your mother story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and thats how i met your mother
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if they are thankful the bombing happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think this is now the fourth engagementwedding that happened as a direct result of the boston bombings as disgusting and terrible as the events were it gives me a little happiness that those two jackass brothers set out to cause so much destruction and death but through the turmoil people found love there will likely be children born who will go on to have children for generations and generations and maybe some of them will go on to do incredible things children that wouldnt have been born if this never happened and will have this crazy legacy and story of how their ancestors met
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not a conspiracy nut but maybe he orchestrated the bombing just to get a girl
UpliftingNews,not_removed,beautiful story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jack shepard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dat romance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a little florence nightingale syndrome for the win
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a beautiful love story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not sure if thats a good idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mom i just got blown up made me laugh and choke up at the same time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i only had a flesh wound
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep it definitely happens like this story from a couple of years ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah thats where the baby boomers got there name soldiers saving girls lives and then getting married and having kids then but its been slow for the last couple of years but starting to pick back up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lemonade
UpliftingNews,not_removed,interesting theory i saw a lot of steel crowd control fences that were bent and twisted and i am pretty sure its been proven that a pressure cooker bomb cant bend steel fences
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for sharing so youre saying all i have to do is become a paramedic or chase ambulances to get a girlfriend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it we are lucky a war will break out and we can get some girlfriends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill be the fat guy that dies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a great story but the header image theyre using made me think for a second i was looking at a meme
UpliftingNews,not_removed,courage of the ppl around us similar story here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man ruins faces with his adopted son who has cerebral palsyabsolutely beautiful story wot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,taking on a multicultural burden somebody give this man a round of applause because to be completely honest i cant be bothered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his mum most be hot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because i was a little afraid to click through the animals have since then been adopted and named panda and lucy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well from what i read in an another article it was called in and they told the em theyve seen the dogs on the tracks for two days kinda like the bystander effect you see some dogs chilling on the tracks thing nothing of it seem em there for two days same spot everyday everytime you pass by well somethings not right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so someone watched for two days before helping
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this always makes me think of that gandhi quote the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cannot aaaawww enough at this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wtf is this bullshit how do we know they were there for days why didnt the photographer at least move the dog off the tracks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not crying there is just something in my eye
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is cool though i doubt the days part
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont get how this sub works how is this uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and the humans just walk and ride past disgusting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sooooboth dogs were saved right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,came here to point this out thanks scumbag cameraman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a repost from another subreddit there was an article that addressed these questions the photographer took pictures for two days it is dangerous to approach an injured dog and another dog guarding it they may attack why take pictures then to show someone with professional experience who can approach dogs in such situations
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as uflannanlight states yes they were adopted after that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they answered this in the original thread the other dog was aggressive and making it impossible for them to approach the injured one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not who you were snarking on but just to offer perspective i cant stand stories of animal suffering i usually read past the headline but in this case i can understand people hesitating and just wanting to know the hopefully happy outcome without the details
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its we dont have time to read things give me everything i want to know in the smallest amount of time also if you can do slideshows with titles that i cant ignore i like that too so i dont even have to think about what i want to look at
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and everyone in the vicinity forgot that animal controlrescue is a thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh sorry i was not aware of the other thread thanks for filling me in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol this sounds like a terrible idea theyre just using this poor man for positive publicity it cost them almost nothing and then they can send him backing back to his heart breakingly depression and hopeless life except now hes had a glimpse of what hes missing cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those damn luxury days your family could be targeted by them next
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck capitalism sometimes the almighty dollar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean thats how its written
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh i hope this works out for the kid thats a big risk hes taking i checked out the website and itsnot fantasticto say the least fingers crossed he makes a succes out of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,would love to try his videogame
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very bad decision the five million is speculation him saying its already worth five million is ridiculous its not someone is willing to speculate that it is worth a risk of five million but that doesnt mean that it is actually worth that im also very curious what is meant by algorithm here he has an algorithm for getting real time price quotes id only call a calculation an algorithm this sounds like he just integrated with something to get data in real time thats not an algorithm thats just software

UpliftingNews,not_removed,is on the road and asked me to declare the winner while he was away so without further ado congratulations uloccolibroccolli on the landslide victory i can only give one gold per comment so ill be venturing into your history to dole out the rest of your windfall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriouslythe rules were so easy so easy and i have a feeling this will be a vicious cycle as even more people comment instead of upvoting further burying the original comments best of luck in counting these ken you have more patience than i do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well played i can work with this ill just have to count them by hand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but comments arent visible enough so were having a mess with lots of people commenting and upvoting left and right i upvoted all the
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it does i work in fossil fuels but i recognize the need for more renewable energy sources the environment needs to be protected
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the rare case where runexpectedfactorial doesnt change the result
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wasnt actually a good year for politics i would have gone with the peace deal with farc if the referendum didnt shoot it down and the new proposed peace deal would have come too late to fall under
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah ken is a pretty rad dude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,watch hillary show httpsyoutubeuxhldloicy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,watch hillary show httpsyoutubeuxhldloicy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,could you elaborate on the reasons behind the fatalities
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stray dogs get blankets manatees no longer endangered soccer team suffers tragedy and continues playing anyway youre right super liberal vet politically focused
UpliftingNews,not_removed,would have gone with but i couldnt help but be reminded of how inefficient panda support efforts are on the bright side some of those resources can now be redirected to other species who are more critical to their ecosystems easier to save andor more in danger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so am i allowed to make my own comment in that case i would say too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the plane ran out of fuel it just shut off and hit a mountain no official report has been given yet ive picked at different articles and they all state that it was a small airplane considering the amount of people onboard plus the direct nonstop flight they should have stopped to refuel but did not its a big risk its negligence in my opinion there are survivors which is impressive but twisted for the people who have to live with the constant why me while they remember their deceased friendscoworkers life is cruel in a way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,might as well everyone else did i guess ill have to count them by hand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry if you need help id volunteer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no big deal i can do it will i watch cartoons
UpliftingNews,not_removed,never been to a muslim country but every american muslim i know is kind and decent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so i sacrificed and worked hard to pay off my student loans and now i get to pay off other peoples student loans too how is this uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,personally i would be pissed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a story she will tell when shes or
UpliftingNews,not_removed,me too im basically allergic to all that an icecream cone includes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love him or hate him as a president you have to admit hes very charismatic and is a fun head of state
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i bet obama gives out full sized candy bars
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he then sang darling nikki and things quickly got weird
UpliftingNews,not_removed,were going to wake from the hangover of this election and the sober realization of what we have lost will set in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obama is so freaking good with kids im going to miss having a president with charisma and personality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the pumpkins are secret service agents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can we just give him a third term
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks obama no really thank you for your time as president well miss it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why does obama have to go 😥😥😥
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish we could keep him for another years i might not like everything hes done but i like him as a president i trust him to not fuck things up royally he is great with kids and comes off so fucking good on camera he doesnt embarrass the country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope he does a cover for when doves cry after the election results are in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my eggs dropped so hard cute kidsexy dad obama is just giving me the baby rabies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in all seriousness how do you get to go to these thing do they just invite some random locals i know some may be diplomats children and such but not everyone looks diplomatic or fancy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as an englishman can we take over your country again and make barry in charge permanantly i know michelle wouldnt like it but you need him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not a kid and have seen some administrations come and go usually at the end of a term its good to move on not so now irrespective of the other candidates i want this man as my president for life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is my president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if these kids even realize what a big deal it is that the president of the united states is giving them candy id be freaking out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the first tune that jumped to my head was chocolate rain oops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obama for president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,let me ask you one question could you see donald trump doing this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont see hillary or donald doing this tbh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obama is cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh and in another few months this guy will no longer be in office gonna miss the last years not a supporter of everything he has done but i do believe he made this country a better place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dammit im gonna miss you obama
UpliftingNews,not_removed,say what you want about obama but neither clinton or trump show the humanistic characteristics that a president should as a person aside from a few of his decisions i feel that president obama is the embodiment of what every citizen should want in a president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,going from obama to trumphillary oh dear god what have we done
UpliftingNews,not_removed,purple rain the best country song of all time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man how do you get to be a kid that does halloween at the white house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,video reenactment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always curtsy for princesses and say your royal highness and act inordinately afraid of scary costumes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for anyone who needs more proof that obamas a really cool guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,best president ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wether or not you like obama you have to admit that hes a pretty chill dude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i miss him already
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks obama
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its nice to see something cute and fun for once during this election cycle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one more term
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sorry but its impossible not to like this guy the fact that his term is ending has so clearly been a weight off his shoulders its like hes human again for the first time in years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i genuinely dont think americans realise just how lucky they are to have obama i think itll hit home when one of these two absolute clowns gets into office
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rey from star wars voice dont go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the song by future
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was hoping obama would be like too soon manway too soon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i tried to remember purple rain went but all i could come up with was theyre pretty much the same song right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish we could keep him as a president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be honest though i cant see hillary doing it either
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at first i thought this was on rnottheonion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont sleep on barryo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought this kid was dressed as a jojo character at first glance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah thats awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like he can sing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so going to miss that guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im betting when obama hits he sounds just like grandad from the boondocks when he sings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im going to miss him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aww how sweet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes going to be the most fun expresident of them all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think the kids ever heard the song
UpliftingNews,not_removed,coolest president ever whether you love him or hate him there is no arguing that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obamas such a chill dude ill miss him d
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wanna see him in a costume
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope once hes retired and out of office he puts out an album of covers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my god i love this man i dont think people realize what we had here he is he ranked president as of now but given more years im sure he would make the top he would already be there if it wasnt for the shit bag republicans working against him to the obama haters remember this a year from now when the us is burning you wanted this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,any way we can elect him a third term
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id love to jam with this dudehe is sooooooo fuckin cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for those who have seen comedians in cars getting coffee can you imagine either of the current candidates on that show obamas episode was so great
UpliftingNews,not_removed,such a good president slow and steady the nation really was able to get to work under obama with none of the bullshit distractions from the previous years obama anyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive spent the last week in an ongoing state of nostalgia rewatching obamas correspondents dinner speeches and different white house videos of obama being a goof as much as ill miss him as president im excited to see what hell get done postpresidency
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and now im sad again remembering were going from this guy to one of the uhpeople currently running in just a couple months
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not a fan of his but i do love this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god damm his singing voice is great anymore videos of him singing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kennedy and obama the two most charismatic presidents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all i can imagine in my head is obama singing chocolate rain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man this guy is out of things to do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a sweet serial drone bomber
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his greatest achievement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what sort of candy do you give prince nose
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this might replace what i associate purple rain with the clermont lounge set the bar pretty high though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i accidentally read that as choclate rain i lost it for a second there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just need my giiiirlfriend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what is this halloweeaster they seem to be celebrating
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i want to go trickortreating at the white house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish this could have been a few years earlier so we could see princes illadvised attempt to sue obama
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plot twist he sings purple rain by future instead of princes purple rain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for one glorious moment i read that as chocolate rain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why am i tearing up i never really listened to prince besides his little red corvette song
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obama seems like the kind of guy i would really like to have a beer and shoot the shit with anyone else see the kid dressed up as a lame duck lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im at unc chapel hill waiting for obama right now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does he still president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obama has been notorious for living this song and its actually based on lsd i cant help but get mildly angry at the hypocrisy of locking people up longer than murderers and rapists for having lsd and the obama administration has done absolutely nothing to change drug laws which disproportionally effect minorities at a disgusting rate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obama seriously won the prize for coolest stateleader
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hope he does that when he comes to my school tomorrow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if the secret service agents also dressed in costumes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the most charismatic man ive ever seen no wonder hes president honestly dont like his stances on a lot of thingseverything but he is such a fun guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im from the uk so dont really have the knowledge to talk about the mans politics however i feel this world is going to be much worse off for not having that man as leader of the united states i just hope he has the successful film career i am wishing for after he has retired
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the little kid really wanted to be prince he picked that costume all on his own
UpliftingNews,not_removed,would have been way cooler if it was purple reign
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im gonna miss my uncle barack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trump or hillary will be the most annoying presidencyi will just drop out for years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some get wet and others feel the pain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill miss him when hes gone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very nice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lolawesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes leaving in style
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh hes like years old and dressed as prince i bet he cant name of princes unreleased vaulted albums
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah if donald were president theres no way he would be comfortable on the big stage as a television personality right reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im really going to miss obama sure he didnt do much to get big money out of politics and he royally screwed up in iraq and syria but considering the mess he inherited and the blind opposition hes faced from conservatives hes done amazingly well by the usa
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not putin so its cool right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yaaaayy so obama can waste his time singing to children but not even address the dakota access pipeline
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about the kids he has killed with drone strikes sing it to them bastard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aw cute the kid is dressed up as the guy who died of an opiate overdose during the obama administrations httpswwwcdcgovdrugoverdoseepidemic adorable if more people died that way wed have more halloween costume options
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obama when was the last time you did anything related to your job thanks the american people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is sad that obama is going to be followed by either a women who is going to steal everything or the next hitler who ever it is america is going to go through hell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man i wish he out as much effort into presiding as he does into his bullshit photo ops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if he ever thinks how many children that age have died thanks to drone strikes that he ordered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as long as he is a cool dude thats all the vast majority cares about smh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if hillary wins will bill have to f her again at least once to celebrate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god i hate this president he probably complained about this after it was over
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while obama may be a charismatic president he has had some pretty horrible failures so we shouldnt associate being cool with being effective
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its so annoying that this is news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,propaganda
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who gives a shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i absolutely agree im not necessarily a fan of his politics but i truly think he is a cool dude whoever wins next week wont have nearly the impact on the young people that bo has
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude seems to thats awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes such a dad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its been a good stretch of years under obama
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah you can hate his actions as president as much as you want but you cant refute the fact that president obama is a cool dude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought the same thing about bush too although to a lesser degree on a personal level he seemed like a dude i wouldnt mind having a beer with the dude was smiling after someone tried throwing shoes at him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have many family members that would have you know his charisma is purely the manipulation of the antichrist spirit within him sigh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think hes been the coolest president weve had in a long time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill admit it did not vote for him either time and i havent been able to pinpoint it until now but for me this is the problem with both of our front running canidates i cannot see hillary or donald handing out treats to kids and enjoying it like he does this act exemplifys why i am having a difficult time choosing a candidate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes i have been told this every single thread he does something charismatic i believe you guys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like youre misunderestimating the people who deeply hate him vs the people who disagree with his policies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,our political landscape is crumbling around us but yay so fun what a cooool dude a
UpliftingNews,not_removed,undoubtedly as a person hes definitely a lighthearted guy and probably fun to be around i signed on to this idea after the comedians in cars segment with jerry on the other hand i do think he set the stage for a very nervewracking years to come
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really like a lot of the things hes done and i like him as a person he strikes me as a great dad and a principled man whose principles include the drone programme which is indiscriminate destruction at its best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,absolutely i think he is one of the most personable politicians weve had in a long time he is quick witted and doesnt take himself too seriously
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but he always has that slight hint of something that makes him seem not right like a psychopath
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except for the leaks that suggest him he was emailing clinton in her famous private server
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he truly seems be enjoying his final stretch as potus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he is going to make a fantastic former president he will have credibility nostalgia and humor all on his side he could accomplish quite a bit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes i am a republican who wont be voting for trump but dang obama is an incredibly intelligent nice guy who loves his family
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what do you think got him elected
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow just what im looking for in a president entertainment value
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a trump supporter i very much agree
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in months time people are going to realise just how good a president he really was and how much we will miss him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes all the civilian drone victims must be spinning with joy in their graves what a guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im going to miss him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honestly after this election i think were going to miss him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is it uplifting the man is going to jail and this is distraction this is evil news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i bet obama has a full sized chocolate candy bar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,purple rain some stay dry and others feel the pain purple rain i move a way from the mic to breath in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,including first spousesmichelle obama is so much awesomer than bill or melania or barack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well never see hillary or trump do some of the charismatic things obama did and it saddens me to think that our mic dropping suave president will be gone in january term plz
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well just a reminder term limits were only introduced to force fdr out because he was so popular i think this situation may justify the opposite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a feeling were gonna see a lot more of o
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same and who seems to put so much time in with the kids events at the white house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,george come take your colonies washington disagrees with you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jfk banging marilyn monroe is worth about mfs megafonzies and averting nuclear war about gotta be close anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually the pumpkin is the republican candidate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a nonamerican i must say that obama may be the best president you guys have had in decades sure not all his policies might be agreed upon by some but as far as i have seenheardfollowed the news about his politics he hasnt done anything wrong just trying to fix the shit bush left for him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is that a thing people say ive never heard that before
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mostly the kids of congressional staffwhite house most senatorsrepresentatives are too old to have little kids but their chiefs of staff usually dosame with people who work in the various white house offices there was some clip of obama being silly with josh earnests white house press secretary kid dressed as superman and i bet they invite a number of local kids too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a kid i went to one of these my dad worked at state dept at the time and got to tour the whitehouse with my kindergarden class because we had a daughter of a senator or congressman in the grade its basically just kids of people who work for the government in some way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or singing to them has that ever even happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i only wanted to see you laughing in chocolate rain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my first thought was the obama mixed up the songs and sang chocolate rain instead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like your style
UpliftingNews,not_removed,halloween i do the best halloween yuuuge halloween all that healthy candy crooked hillarys friend michelle obama tries to force on kids full of chemicals disgusting trying to kill our children and mexican candy disgusting wed have the best candy the best american candy like in the old days kids would need more bigly sacks to carry all the candy trust me youll see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really want to see hillary singing purple rain now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,listen kid i like your spark but youre fired get out of here next child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes just not very well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i could see him stealing the kids candy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not without making a few of the kids cry no
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you replace sings by grabs and the child withpussy totally yeah edit i realized the title would be donald trump grabs purple rain to little pussy dressed as prince
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is halloween isnt it supposed to scare people donald trump will do that a thousand times better than obama could ever do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres gotta be at least one white house sexy halloween party though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can the kids all cry tho
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the less air time the next president gets the better its just going to be so cringe worthy the us is about to go full berlusconi whoever wins
UpliftingNews,not_removed,blue eyes crying in the purple rain was my favorite willie nelson prince duet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,prince is an amazing folk musician
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you will have a hard time convincing all the good old boys that obama did anything but ruin their country but that was going to be the case no matter what he actually did in office of the southern trump supporters are from his clever use of racism to get their support most of them are too blind to see it and i am not entirely sure trump even truly thinks like that but does understand its an easy way to gain support and he used it perfectly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,president trump sees your kid on halloween sniffs loudly that costume is worth onequarter portion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hillary would sing it would be awkward and in that brief moment everyone would contemplate about how the universe is indifferent to our suffering
UpliftingNews,not_removed,michelle cause bo is done i am afraid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont think you live in the us to make that comment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell him ujpguitfiddler said hi
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the down votes shows the age of reddit crazy to think no one recognizes one of the biggest videos of the early
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah donald is good at being a television personality have to give you that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if only being on tv made you qualified to run one of the most powerful nations on the planet we would be electing peter dinklagebut it doesnt so we shouldnt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we all know who our twitter president would beugh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,geez buzzkill
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont sign your bullshit to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe if the gop would stop blocking everything the president did you wouldnt be saying that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he hands out candy to kids and you still get mad how obtuse see here to answer your question httppleasecutthecrapcomobamaaccomplishments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more likely the next berlusconi
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a woman who is going to steal everything thats a new one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably at the same time thinking of all the kids that age he saved from the actual targets of the drone strikes killed that were then not allowed to take child brides and prostitutes or simply killing them in front of their parents for effect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,every election big and small is a popularity contest at heart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not really but it doesnt hurt no one likes a complete asshole well unless you are a republican then its a birds of a feather kind of thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre thinking of trump this halloween was rigged obama seems like a pretty cool guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the president along with everything else gets lumped with being a major role model for the entire nation and sort of even overseas too as the head of the worlds remaining superpower no matter what you think about his political achievements or nonacheivments i think most people can agree that obama has been a great role model for how a good adult behaves he is friendly and respectful he is thoughtful while still having moments of relaxation and playfulness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,go to rdataisbeautiful and you will see that you are wrong he adopted bushs economic trouble and is the economy better now than then yes it is he did a good job with what he was given google the stats the numbers dont lie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cuck wtf are you a gimp what a stupid fucking thing to saybut i guess really edgy for an year old
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh god its next week
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree body odor profoundly affected my life as a young person terrible politics too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think hes done a good job at making people forget that his initials are bo thanks for reminding us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and i agree also came here to say this also no matter how one feels about how well or poorly he has done politically he has set a fine example of humanity to our next generation of aspiring presidents the entire family has done really well for being on public display in the white house for years i think they will be remembered positively
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when trump appeared on the wwe ring he was fun as hell though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plus he really can carry a tune
UpliftingNews,not_removed,impact on young people like ℅ black unemployment race riots and serial murdering of police officers fun times
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not a fan of his politics but seems to be a very common comment on reddit does anyone on reddit actually know his politics he wants whats best he just sucks at implementing any of it properly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bho
UpliftingNews,not_removed,impact on the young people that bo has body odor impacts all of us pal keep your micro aggressions to yourself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh that dog of mine canned laugh track
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bo knows
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean its a well behaved doggo and awfully cute when it was a pupper but whats so memorable about bo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,flotus in converse love it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the way he starts singing purple rain out of nowhere so cringetastically daddish
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes so natural youd almost think hes had kids of his own
UpliftingNews,not_removed,amend that fucker lets do this shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this he doesnt nearly get the credit he deserves i think after a couple of years of hillary or heaven forbid trump people will reflect on obama more favourably hes charismatic stately and definitely the leader that america needed when the country was going through a major economic shitstorm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously honestly i wish we could just elect to keep him in office another term as an emergency alternative until we are able to find a more suitable candidate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can you imagine where wed be if he was able to govern the way he wanted ive seen a lot of presidents and hes so much a cut above than anything thats come before and im pretty certain what will follow in the next few decades
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think you can say this about every president since ford well i suppose carter and the first bush would be considered classy dudes and not cool but close enough reality is if you take partisanship aside people tend to be pretty cool in general
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course he was smiling dude was rightfully proud of his dodging skills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that man has some seriously impressive reflexes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trump isnt an antichrist though hes just an opinionated white man that is a little bit selfish and exploitative
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like a rough family
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im gonna miss him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hillary would not enjoy it she would do it because she has to but it would be cold and shed rather being doing something else trump of course would use taxpayer funds to buy trump brand candy bars at a bar and let the little girls know how sexy their costumes are as they pass not the fat ones though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so youre a have a beer with kinda voter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you see the video of obama showing off his erection through his pants to his staffers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes the president its actually king size
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whoa whoa whoano one is more awesome than bill sax man clinton
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tbh im not really digging michelle obama shes so obviously fake too hypocritical the white house feels like home to raise my children in a year later ive had to deal with living in this house built by slaves hillary cant run her own marriage and household how can she run the country years later i love you president hillary sit on my face s obviously but you get the point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,michelle should have run
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cooler than bill woah hold on there cowboy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im really interested to see what he does after leaving office
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she doesnt want to be president but id vote for michelle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and thomas then we will fight in the shade jefferson
UpliftingNews,not_removed,come at me bro george washington
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but he got shot on video that kind of ruins everything now people just remember that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the greatest pumpkin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at least hillary wont embarass us abroad i cant imagine trump meeting with other heads of state and not making an ass of himself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they call it that because they become aggressive lose all motor control and become bedridden until their inevitable painful and shivering death
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sploosh is usually sufficient
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha my husband and i say it all the time examples include that pizza looks so good that my eggs are dropping or did your eggs drop if one of us gets a new video game and becomes glassy eyed while playing it for the first time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would hope they give some local kids the chance to stop on by with background checks of course lol that makes sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgisgczadzpc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,muscial presidents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a great way to kill the song
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she strikes me as more of a celine dion or adele fan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,with that creepy rictus smile in place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love kids bring all you kidsjust kidding getem outta here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,noun compelling attractiveness or charm that can inspire devotion in others is that what he has
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because whatever he has might be attractive to certain people but it makes a lot of others particularly women and children very uncomfortable on a gut level not talking about his policies or what he says but his aura creeps out a lot of women and kids seem to cringe away from him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,look think yourselves lucky obama is smart charming and sociable all david cameron has ever done of note is leave his child in a pub by accident thats it entire time of running the country and thats all anyone will remember him for that and being a complete cunt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cackled i laughed so hard at that image
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she seemed like she would do it because someone on her staff suggested it to her barry o seems like he does this kinda stuff on his own accord
UpliftingNews,not_removed,better than a bad role model
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you understand the concept of separation of powers of the federal government do you know the executive branch does not make laws
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean calling him literally hitler is a bit much but hes certainly the worst candidate to ever win the primaries ever bar none
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think more children innocent mothers fathers etc died then those types of people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure because most the public are sheep we only get change when everyone wants change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i know exactly what im thinking of millinial
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is one of the worst economic recoveries since the great depression but i didnt mean the economy when i said failures i meant his foreign policy and social issues
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at least inauguration day is a ways away yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im still kind of nervous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,isnt it exciting two wonderful candidates to choose from how can america lose
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck i forgot to study which one of them is for weed again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think autocorrect changed thank to oh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my bags are packed and im ready to feck off back to ireland go hide in the sally gap or down in wexford
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not even a week away at this point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,days holy crap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,finally this circle jerk will be over
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank fuck get it off my news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes actually older than her surprisingly but only by a year trump bill clinton and george bush were all born within two months of eachother
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because he keeps grabbing the older nieces asses and making wildly inappropriate comments about the yo ones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and he drinks all the best liquor but never brings any to parties
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah hillary is your mom who takes no shit but loves you real hard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youd almost think that a small cloud of suspended organically produced particles wouldnt have much experience as a politician
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im here for you man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he wants whats best he just sucks at implementing any of it properly also a common sentiment hes cut unemployment in half cut deficit by saved the auto industry gotten great new scotus justices expanded lgbt rights provided healthcare access to over of americans not gotten into any new wars despite enormous pressures and generally behaved with a grace and class that is rare in politics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think he got obstructed over properly implementing the aca so that the rates of premiums wouldnt go up as much thanks republicans one thing that will always mar his presidency for me is how he handled the nsa leaks i was incredibly disappointed to hear that he was supporting that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is all fdrs fault
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you want dictator trump cause thats how you get dictator trump or dictator clinton see im playing both sides fair and balanced lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes had one of the better second terms in recent memory most presidents get worse after reelection but i think hes better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im an urban canadian art student with long hair im liberal mcliberal but right now with trump as a possible future im looking back eight years ago and w has gone from the dimwit destroying america to the lovable scamp who didnt have a choice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and lest we forget it was the gop that put us in that situation wars we couldnt afford a crashed economy and our international reputation destroyed why would anyone want to give them control of the entire government i think thats what a lot of people dont understand if hillary wins she gets an obstructionist congress the same one that under obama earned the historical title least productive congress in us history if trump wins the gop gains control of all branches of government and the supreme court its absurd to hand them all of that for years of blocking every bill we asked for and then bitching wheres the hope and change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he will be looked at very favorable in a decade or two
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpimgurcomgcfxbkw
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so id like to know what hilary has planned for us that is so bad in everyones eyes id really like to hear it instead of omg were fucked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shit with the prospects of clinton or trump we are starting to say that maybe bush wasnt all that bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im perfectly fine with clinton for someone as supposedly corrupt as the lunatic right claims she is they sure never manage to find a law she has broken
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all you have to do is look at the literally hundreds of bills the gop blocked over the last years to see what could have been
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which presidents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are very generous and kind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup that person would know that much if they had even watched the debates
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like someone else said shes been working for childrens rights most of her life why wouldnt she get some joy out of helping kids you guys make her out to be some kind of demon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it goes much deeper than just handing out candy youre focusing on the wrong part of his comment put a little more thought into it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you have to realize though while the president has other responsibilities hes a symbol of our country and has to treat with other foreign powers so his image and personality is incredibly important
UpliftingNews,not_removed,risky click of the day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought that was going to be the picture of obama eric andre always has with him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,michelle is not always smiling for no reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,isnt there a subreddit for these cards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive personally had a bite duh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i dont know if id call her a turd other than her poor taste in men is there anything much wrong about her to me its like comparing a biege wall to a sunset the beige wall isnt great but neither is it awful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sure epsteins girls know all about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah bill is pretty fucking cool im torn between him and michelle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously bill will make the whole thing way more fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,context matters and the fact that youre interpreting her endorsement as sit on my face is just absurd and when did she say the thing about dealing with living in this house built by slaves i remember her bringing up the wh being built by slaves but thats not the same thing at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,living up to your username eh the guy is extremely well presented for a public speaker stuttering on occasion is nothing compared to the gaffes most people make every day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,run for earth president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i bet he michelle are gonna travel alot after taking a nice long break of chillin at home in hawaii im sure at some point hell also out cool his kids when they get into college
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i did not like george w bush as president but i love the fact that he now paints pictures of dogs and world leaders maybe theyll become painting buds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,go make half a bill on the speaking circuit and chill
UpliftingNews,not_removed,immigrate to canada and become prime minister you dont have to be born in canada to become prime minister and im sure hes great in french
UpliftingNews,not_removed,franklin i cant move my legs but i can fuck your bitch rosevelt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be fair jefferson followed the enlightenment movement which was very avant garde for his time and very metal or cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no no that was president dienekes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he also banged slaves in the shade
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont you mean thomas i got that jungle fever jefferson
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you really want to see what that could look like just look at the filipino president that guy is making an ass out of himself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well that just took a turn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you have no idea how much work i just put in to upvote this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,phrasing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a dude and im going to try to find a chance to use it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its the obamasof course they do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh i know obama kills me can he be my dad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i bet hillary sounds like yoko ono
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you cant kill purple rain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,buble on repeat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kids seem to cringe away from him are we still correcting the record cause im sure i can find instances of this for both candidates
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess i just see her as very formal which i appreciate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know about checks and balances between each branch do you realize that nothing gets done if congress doesnt do anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well if anyone would know it is you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well sheep but not in the pejorativenot to me at least people are too wrapped up in their everyday bullshit to engage politics seriously only the truly deranged make time for it i have a grad degree in policy and even im like ah shit i dunno in california weve got about a dozen ballot initiatives thats a lot to look over and i dont have the expertise to quickly assess each one ive gotta get into the weeds a little to sort them out by next week and when it comes to selecting the judges forget about it haha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol typical trump supporter insults that arent even accurate one of these days youll get a brain scarecrow it might help your case if you could spell millennial right but i know i know high school is hard especially for the year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i get triggered by idiotic year olds trying to sound like theyre cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it enough time for me to travel to mars
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the first election ive lived through where ive felt intense dread for either outcome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at least its good tv drama i guess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,johnson
UpliftingNews,not_removed,neither its up to the states rights states are in ballot for full recreational legalization
UpliftingNews,not_removed,both will be said
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lmao if you think it will stop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but when you are the cool uncle they let you do it you can do anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but trump has come a long way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly only misinformed say obama hasnt done anything my old roommate who went from radical republican to radical liberal to radical tea party member all withing years running and failing for congress in new mexico and once told me that he was still waiting for the promised change from obama this was after years of republican congress shutting down every idea obama had his only source of news was youtube videos
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well if we really want to get to the root of the problem fdr only did terms cuz some dick wanted to take back old territories and violate human rights and things of the sort
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im an urban american former art student whos less liberal mcliberal than i used to be but will always see w as a religiousnut who failed national security sirens and dragged the country into a year war that will last years longer in a part of the world we really shouldnt have to be in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats another thing obama did restore a bit of faith in america as a nonamerican but keen observer i can definitely say that america was suddenly cool again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no bush was pretty bad the appointing roberts then getting citizens united and that whole power vacuum in iraq which led to isis was a shitshow rove you might want to google lee atwater southern strategy he used the same tactics and they were very close
UpliftingNews,not_removed,johnson nixon ford carter reagan bush clinton bush
UpliftingNews,not_removed,halloween president trump awaits a line of children dressed up in costumes a little boy and girl walk up to him dressed as kermit and miss piggy president trump says oh who do we have here miss universe he then grins like he came up with something incredibly witty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,link pls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess the part where she plagiarized michelle obamas speech
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im thinking itll be a bit sadder than that hes getting old its going to be like visiting a zany uncle from your childhood hell hurt himself trying to get up out of his chair in a rush to give your year old brother a surprise wet willie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish we were getting bill to be our first man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,basically im using sit on my face instead of kissing her ass thought that was clear enoughwhen obama was running against her years ago they dogged her out and now shes heaven sent get real
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thatd be a rock solid idea if king boomy wasnt already in office
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are staying in dc for a couple of years until their daughters all graduate from high school hopefully they can chill in hawaii on their daughters spring break or summer break maybe a week long babysitter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure im a huge jefferson fan my parent comment just reminded me of king leonides and httpsenwikipediaorgwikimolonlabe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dienekes i admit i had to look him up and found what looks to be one of the coolest most consistently updated blogs on the internet going back to httpdienekesblogspotcom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,best president best person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree that ended in a far different place than where i started
UpliftingNews,not_removed,see you think that but
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just the christmas album all year long
UpliftingNews,not_removed,imo that says more about his followers than him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oki guess i see your point a very focused kind of charisma on the one hand and a kind of anticharisma on the other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre probably right there probably arent that many pictures of babies cringing around trump since he kicks them out of his rallies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,will you support a democratic senate not supporting president trumps initiatives or will you also call that gridlock
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who could you find that won their parties primary that is a less presidential individual than trump
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is this a jab towards my pakistani descent i was born in the us and still live here bro
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god i cant wait until you liberals cry next tuesday night i have two bachelor degrees btw which i paid for my self
UpliftingNews,not_removed,three months to marry the canadian or aussie of your dreams
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hear you but these two outcomes are not alike
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont understand where this is coming from surely someone one voted for them in the primaries yet this is all i hear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,either outcome its gonna be shit one worse than the other in any case a shitstorm will wise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a hillary supporter but still am nervous about when she wins how people are gonna react
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im just waiting to see what tricks obama has up his sleeve once the election is settled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it will never stop but at least the whole political flooding on advertisements and social media will hopefully calm down crosses finger every seconds is basically a fuck her no no fuck him noooo fuck this guy in particular paid for by blah blah blah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,badum tss
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes just imagine if he got so much stuff done with total obstruction how much he would have gotten done if the other side behaved rationally
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but the senate didnt have majority large enough to prevent filibuster
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how the aca was implemented at the state level correlates completely with how you view the aca republican controlled states did not implement it the way it was designed they obstructed it so that it would fail the original versions of the aca did not use a state run model this was a compromise position back when there was a possibility that compromise was a wotkable model in government
UpliftingNews,not_removed,arlen specter had to switch parties after he cast the vote for obamacare and that was only after the public option was cut out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i attribute that to just whispering from his father and cheney who darkens each world and how utterly insane everybody in america was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,iraq was such a terrible move with so many of the hijackers being saudi we really should not try to be allies with them get off the oil dependence and tell them to fuck off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im pretty sure she had no clue she handed a speech and she read it off an autocue i dont think she would have had any input into the speech writing process of course someone in the trump camp is to blame for it but i dont think its her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,blaming her for that is pretty stupid if you believe she had any say in that speech whatsoever then you probably dont know much about politics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes a mad genius
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rock solid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and dwight im about to make you my beach normandy eisenhower
UpliftingNews,not_removed,huh thats quite neat edit at the bottom it says the blog has been active for days i assume thats the day it was created monday of february which also happens to be my birthday
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when that blogger checks his stats huh november was a banner day for my blog what did i post reddit makes bloggers happy every once in while
UpliftingNews,not_removed,leave it to ol gates to put the kibosh on a good time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i will not support democrats senators that block what the president does trump or clinton as president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,easy hillary rodham clinton
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a jab at any civilian that thinks they are in some position to have more information than the president or military i am sure obama sits in his office trying to figure out how many innocent people he can kill each day bc he seems like a maniac like that and all i really appreciate that you have no responsibility in the matter nor carry the stress he has to protect his troops or america or foreign civilian lives etc but you can sit on a message board and know how has been killed and the motivations brah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have two bachelor degrees btw sure you do buddy sure you do get those from trump university i imagine thats where they taught you to spell feel free to get a hold of me next week when you are crying about a woman beating you instead of you know you beating woman for a change btw dipshit hillary isnt a liberal only dumb fucks like you think so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we all know clinton is going to win trump winning is a pipe dream
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kids using the word cuck without even knowing what it means all while being a cuck to big daddy trump youre a fucking moron and sound even dumber when you use that word
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah our aussie government is pretty shithouse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats aiming low im looking for a scandinavian
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hah jokes on you im not american
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope not even in the slightest theyre just both bad outcomes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well theyre alike in that theyre both awful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,million people voted for trump and million people voted for hillary turnout for primary elections is even more embarrassing than general elections most people let other people choose the candidates and then complain about the candidates on the dem side clintons support trended towards old people and minorities both of those groups are underrepresented on the internet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my mom voted for trump in the primaries she regrets it now im trying to convince her to vote third party to take down the twoparty system that we have any acknowledgement that is given to a third party is a plus no matter who the candidate is i feel that we need to know that anyone can run for president not just the big wigs who can easily be noticed by the two major parties im note bashing this on her we have actual discussions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those are the people we should be mad at gets pitchfork out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hear that randy the winds of shit are blowing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,false equivalency trump is like clinton in the same way your dick catching on fire is like an ant bite a chimp ripping your face off and sucking your intestines out your ass vs a year old slapping you in the leg a dog pissing in your mouth before your mom catches you jerking off with her used underwear pressed to your nose vs getting caught picking a booger by your cat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont forget to tip your waiters folks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,slowed down by cletus and jethro bahahahahaa
UpliftingNews,not_removed,accepting the medicaid expansion also wasnt designed to be optional chief justice roberts did that when he upheld the rest of the law
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty sure bush senior would have warned him away from iraq as being a fucked up quagmire considering he himself took a lot of shit for not taking bagdad and occupying iraq because he knew it would be a fucked up quagmire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have an upvote sir
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the thing is when youre on a team of servers at mcdonalds or the cheesecake factory or the gap or whatever you can say those other guys fucked up not me you can do that and its fine when you want to be first lady of the usa you dont get to do that you choose your staff you are responsible for their work you accept any reflection good or bad that your staff creates of who you are thats what the job is about showing you can run an effective professional team that does things right you dont get to say you cant blame me for what the other guy did its not my fault thats a mcdonalds level excuse the first lady doesnt get to do that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read once over it and thats all because i wrote it and with as little help as possible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that kinda makes it worse that she had no clue or input in that decision
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and maybe she did something and she can take some responsibility for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this reminds me of something steve jobs said im paraphrasing here but he basically said when youre a janitor and you cant do your job because for example you dont have a key for a locked storage closet thats your excuse when youre vice president you dont get to make excuses if the job doesnt get done or gets done wrong thats all on you im aware melania trump didnt write the speech that she gave and didnt know what was in it and at the janitor level thats a fine excuse for first lady level it isnt when you want to be first lady of the united states of america you dont get to say i didnt know what was in the speech i gave to million people its not my fault the speech is a reflection of you how you choose your staff how you run your affairs and in that regard melania not only failed but did so in an embarrassing way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was one month before i graduated college thanks for making me feel old asshole
UpliftingNews,not_removed,presidents do not make law they only enforce existing law im not sure what you think the congress is blocking president obama from doing are you referring to where they voted against his budget
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ಠಠ yeah sure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,noooooot even slightly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except obamas drone strikes are common fucking knowledge you apologist swine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,university of houston supply chain mgmt and mgmt enrolling in professional mba program next semester made a on my gmat two months ago now go fuck your self also served in the marines from you liberal fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just wait what are you gonna do cry i bet you will
UpliftingNews,not_removed,still better than that shit show
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but then you have to learn a new language
UpliftingNews,not_removed,scuse u
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not really aiming low
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hur är läget
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about a scandinavian living in canada
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bring lots of money plzz otherwise we might not let you stay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how you doin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some say obama isnt either
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well trump did say recently how nice it would be if we attacked first so i would not expect you to be safe anywhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the lesser of two evils is still less evil
UpliftingNews,not_removed,am minority can confirm my parents asked if i was voting for hillary i told them no to which they replied that i must be voting for the enemy donald trump i didnt have the heart to tell them that other options exist not that voting third party with our current system matters anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,older minorities cause bernie won the majority of those under of all backgrounds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are a lot of things i dont like about hillary most are about how she handles shit and her attitude towards certain things a couple are how she might govern none come close to the dumpster fire that is trump i wont mind a clinton presidency at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure bernie wouldnt have been able to follow through on all of his ideals but that isnt the point no president is able to follow through on everything they believe is right because that isnt the way a democracy works obama would have loved to bring about more grandiose change like he had promised during his campaign but you can only do so much when there are so many in congress that would rather be standing still than moving forward for the next years it seems there is simply too much division in the us to make any sort of progress
UpliftingNews,not_removed,throws waiter over
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes thankyou
UpliftingNews,not_removed,source httpwwwsnopescombushsenoiragainstwar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i imagine the military has plans to invade every country on earth because thats what they do in their spare time make plans are you suggesting the choice to initiate those plans and happening was just a coincidence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well what do you expect a first ladyhusband to do i personally think its weird that the husband or wife of a nominee would even give a speech they arent the ones being voted for so id rather a first husbandwife just host functions etc and be told what to do rather than have any input
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah after that other guy posted a link to the news article saying she wrote it i conceded shes either lying that she wrote it and thats shitty or she did deliberately plagiarise michelles speech i was just generally trying to say that i dont give a shit what the nominees spouse does youre not voting for them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude i think your smiley face with a nose did a fine job of that before he did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre blocking him from nominating a judge for the judicial branch they refuse to vote for the nomination because they only want to have a gop president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have you a moment to talk about our fatherof the say no policy mitch mcconnell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like i said if anyone would know its you i am sure the expert on who has or hasnt been killed in drone strikes is you let us all know when you are on cnn giving your expert opinion on the matter name calling over the internet really doesnt heart my feelings sweetheart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol sure buddy im sure you did now you spend youre time being a piece of shit on reddit well played you fucking lying douche bag you are probably drinking a two litter of mt dew and beating off in your moms basement right now im going to keep your user name we will talk in a week when you are crying like the bitch you are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude are you fucking dim have you seen how many early democraticvotes there are two thirds more then trump alreadyyou can actually vote on the election in vegas and see the odds online those guys have some of the best statisticians in the world and hillary has a of winning they arent going to lost to odds if they werent pretty damn sure the writing is on the wall you fucking dumby stop being a retard for one second and do some research
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one im not american and two i support niether trump nor clinton both are some of the worst choices for president that you could pick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre just too cool for me now go have your mom change your diapers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you have a point but percent of native scandinavians speak english httpsenmwikipediaorgwikilistofcountriesbyenglishspeakingpopulation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah the language of love
UpliftingNews,not_removed,domestically oh god yeah my fingers are crossed that hillary doesnt just brute force in that nofly zone or were so fucked highly doubt that though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im only pointing out that both candidates likely will result in a shitty outcome i never said theyre alike allaround i said in particular that theyre alike in that theyre both awful fuck you i like applebees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the applebees hate is ridiculous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but the under the especially minorities dont vote nearly as much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but unfortunately for bernie people under only made up of the total voters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell that to the spirit of eleanor roosevelt i dare ya
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well what do you expect a first ladyhusband to do write their own speeches like michelle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpimgurcomapilkn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its ok hillary is doing a pay to play scheme for her justice spot when she gets the chance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,keep it hope you do cant wait i hate soda by the way and my parents and my girlfriend all just came back from days in europe while your poor liberal ass was at your shitty a year job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,watch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can confirm married to a swede highly recommend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you will certainly not get a job there unless you learn the language
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honestly applebees has been around longer than like presidents why cuz the shit is pleasant and enjoyable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what shitty outcome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its cool that you like it but no i could just stay home and eat lean cuisine for an aesthetically identical meal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i rarely eat there but i know two things off hand that are better than microwave bullshit burgers and steaks now if you go spend for fettuccine alfredo that is your problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,english is her second language and who gives a shit what the partner of the person youre electing says anyway i get your point if youre going to do a speech write it yourself and i agree but i just dont think its really a big deal from her pointofview here in the uk you never see the spousespartners of the leaders of the main parties etc because they arent running in the same way that my girlfriend isnt dragged into a job im interviewing for to answer some questions so the fact that they said to her this is a thing we do over here read this speech from this autocue and she did without knowing it was plagarised doesnt make me think any worse of her really it was a shitty thing to do from the trump camp whoever it was who knew they were plagarising but back to the point at hand melania is just beige boringness who read a speech in her secondlanguage once to fulfill a requirement michelle is politically active and wants to make an impact hence you see michelle going around as a clinton surrogate but melania only really is in the media to defend trumps character and personal exploits
UpliftingNews,not_removed,much better very hip
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol wow a lot of assumptions you must be the smartest guy in all the trailer park good to know you hate soda thanks for that info you sound really smart rtakemetoyourleader you are obviously a genius btw you can thank liberals fdr and jfk for making america great again or thank james madison and thomas jefferson for making america you might want to return those degrees someone might be mad you stole them talk to you next week that is if you still have internet connected then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like the cemetery itself isnt enough scary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,soul of a deer hit by car
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is a heard of albino deer on a fenced in abandoned military base in the southern tier of upstate ny you can see them regularly as you pass while driving down very surreal looking animals like something out of a c s lewis novel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know what you mean however this is a beautiful cemetery overlooking boise its so peaceful and beautiful you can look out and see the entire valley my baby niece is buried right behind where the deer is standing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,makes the i would walk miles guys seem like pussies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i drove miles to get laid once i feel your pain mate

UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am amazed how eager people are to mock this story in these comments if you find a story like this so hard to believe might say something about your own life eh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what no one seems to be talking abouthe basically hasnt aged in years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol one of their kids is named karlsiddhartha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow that is a love story for the ages ❤️
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i wake up i am gonna be gonna be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a belgian traveller kindly pointed out to him that sweden was in fact a different country from switzerland it was a bit of a blow to realise i had even further to go than i thought he admits ruefully wow this guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how long did the trip take him in my head i want to believe he forrest gumped it and just started riding and never stopped until he found her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im from australia and we never get stories like this

UpliftingNews,not_removed,my mothers cousin married a guy that biked from australia to norway he met her and after the tourist visa expired he biked around in europe for three months until he could come back and then they got married so he could stay been married for years now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,read this story several times and each time left me feeling good about humanity glad people like these two exists
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is how my wife and i feel in fact i knew within minutes of eye contact that she was it took her almost a year but she got there too i was looking at her the exact moment she realized it and i saw the look in her eyes never forget the way her whole face changed it was like oh and ah ha all at once them this big smile to be fare we had not seen each other for the past nine months see i was the other guy we saw each other for about three months after we met them she couldnt handle it and walked away from both nine months later a fraternity brother of mine showed up and says here some girl gave this to me to give to you it was a set of greek worry beads i had given her i called her the next morning she came over and plopped down on my couch while i was cleaning my room i reached to put some books on a shelf and glanced over my left shoulder at her and she was just staring at me with this sorta dazed look i dropped the books and stepped over the coffee table between us she was already starting to stand so i grabbed her and pulled her to her feet and we kissed that was september of we married in september why didnt i chase after her when she walked away i knew i didnt need to i knew i just had to give her space and time what happened to the worry beads oh they are hanging on the wall of our bedroom right where they belong edit i texted the link to my wife and her comment thats the most beautiful story i have ever read
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she doesnt look to happy in the pic where they were reunited
UpliftingNews,not_removed,amazing stuff now if governments would stop making us fight each other things may get better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in the a man rides km and most women find it romantic in a man rides km and women say wtf get out of here stalker its been like a over a year ive moved on geez
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this should be made into a movie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this story was recently part of my swedish test
UpliftingNews,not_removed,beautiful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably would have been easier to take a train or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this guy gave the proclaimers a run for their money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all i see singles in your area couple of nsfw photo appear fml
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really want to go russia for that one girl although usrussia ties are not good i dont know how to do that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as soon as i read this article i thought of this song
UpliftingNews,not_removed,think of all the pokemon candies he could have gotten
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shit id sail from california to sweden on a dinghy if i had a sexy swedish woman give her love to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reading all this makes me think as things have become easier to find it is becoming harder to appreciate their value going back to the previous generations they had to work hard and earn stuff so that they could appreciate the value of it be it material or otherwise the struggle made the result fulfilling the instantaneousness of todays world is making us all more complacent i really fear for the next generation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they got married and then she went back had he hadnt biked his way would they kept being married but separated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dawww
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ummm how old is she
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cycle to work every day miles
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am ready to ride my bike across pacific ocean on water if someone gives me a green card theres just so many ppl in india d
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would like to cycle around the cycle but never for a womenlove thats just being desperate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,harold and maude except hopefully shes not dying of cancer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,crazy what people had to do for love in the before the invention of automobiles trains and aeroplanes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be fair they were willing to walk more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i drove miles to get laid once but she only wanted to do anal to preserve her virginity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yet again we did it reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,however if she didnt reciprocate it would be down right psychotic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i rode my motorcycle across the states to chase who i thought was the one she called me delusional would ride again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you must cherish that and do whatever it takes or sulk for around months to years until it dissipates
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah the old disney fantasy gotta ride across the world for this one woman as if there arent billion other women around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,true love yeah he cycled km she couldnt miss her flight back lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does true love really exist from my understanding humans are naturally polygamous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more like a whole lotta love
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would be so happy plz
UpliftingNews,not_removed,change the leading man to tom hiddleston and we got ourselves a movie safe for a hollywood release
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she was from a httptopyapscompradyummatheindianwhotravelledtoswedenonacyclejustforlove royal family and offered to but he wanted to finish art school and get to sweden his own way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boyfriend steps out actually in underwear and says who the fuck are you now let me get back to nailing her hard and deep
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait until you see marathon runners
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and the visa and citizenship are to die for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats what i was thinking he still looks pretty young
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why not both
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i believe the article said months
UpliftingNews,not_removed,coz your girls are ugly mate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we cant cycle on the oceanmate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i called lies on that you cant bike across oceans australia and norway are separated by two oceans each direction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,question when you kissed her did you hear the music swell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well they are married and have two kids so something worked out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in another interview with bbc she explains that her mother was hesitant about the marriage which may explain the picture oh shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the door bell rings she opens the door to her home in sweden in and thinks oh for fucks sake not this guy again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trump
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the couple are convinced that the analogue era of the helped build their relationship through trepidation heightened emotion and the anticipation of reunion i think those things have been lost now in a digital age where you can so easily get together says lotta theres no chance to tune in to use your sixth sense about someone now says pk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,other articles about them mention that shes actually wealthy and offered to buy him a plane ticket but he refused he wanted to get there on his own terms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reach out to edwardsnowden
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you could bike across the ocean
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats the point of this post
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know you can unsubscribe yes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you couldnt walk ten miles for anything dont question those who did thousands
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no they were like super hippies and convinced they had a spiritual bond it worked out for them because theyve been married years and they are still loving each other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,april fools was yesterday
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my friend actually did do this sort of thing and did get arrested for stalking lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and on foot id much rather ride miles on a bike than walk on foot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes but da da da da
UpliftingNews,not_removed,noted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont see the problem here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like a win to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she married him in india so she was crazy too it worked out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the absence of regret and what ifs makes it its own reward
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea but to her or just for the scene
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i prefer this tactic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not practical or advisable but its a cute story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really wish i could be there when you meet that one special person who changes you in ways you never imagined possible of course im assuming youre part of the population that isnt a narcissistic psychopath if you are well imagine a world with no mirrors and everyone ignores you that should get you close to the same emotion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would go across the world if my childhood friend needed me why not for a cherished partner im not saying soul mates are real but that relationships are worth putting that effort into
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this was in there were less its best for him to play it safe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually there would only have been a mere httpwwwworldometersinfoworldpopulationworldpopulationbyyear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,with a book about it coming out i predict an oscar bait movie starring dev patel and oh say emma stone within the next years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wouldnt be surprised if they did that replace an indian role with a brit that would be ironic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hmm yeah that explains it a lot more and isnt as sensationalist as the ops headline he was already somewhat well known for his drawings and the girl wanted to meet him so she flew down to see him they hung out for a bit and then got married in india then as you said she offered to take him home but he refused because he didnt want to accept her money and wanted to finish school what i think is funny is the whole getting to sweden his own way because he actually took trains paid for by people that he meet along the way maybe he felt that was justified because he helped them oh well still an amazing story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that seems fairly impressive to go that far in so short a time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well we dont need to hear about bogan love stories dude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kylie minogue nicole kidman margot robbie dude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not with that attitude mate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he didnt mention it but this was before continental drift
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe hes from the future when there is a series of bridges between new mapoon and possession island possession island and entrance island entrance island and prince of wales island aforementioned and hammond island that and hawkesbury island moa island badu island mabuiag island turnagain island talbot islands new guinea waigeo pulau gag pulau gebe north maluku sidangoli to ternate ternate to unnamed tiny island pulau maju cuz ternate directly to bitung is way too damn long random island pulau maju to bitung bira to pulau selayar pulau jampea random island between jampea and bonerate with the landmark masjid nurul yaqin on it pulau bonerate riung rinca komodo sumbawa lombok bali java sumatra malaysia and then the rest is just land which he can bike across edit i need to zoom in on google maps more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe he swam to asia from oz with a bike on his back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so since he took a boat to get across the ocean my post isnt legit edit looking at it again it was a bit badly worded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they always add the music after the filming
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh agreed she just looks kind of shell shocked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or donald trump whichever is easier trumps probably on twitter more tbh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trolls trying in insert some muslim hate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to spread hatred
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just pointing out that if she had tried to make the same journey it likely wouldnt be a story with as happy of an ending it sucks that we live in world where men can go on amazing romantic adventures but if women try the same thing they are in mortal danger there are plenty of christian countries where a woman wouldnt be safe traveling alone in as well for the people who think my comment is islamophobic turkey and other countries many of which are majority christian arent safe for women to travel through
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never subscribed to this sub the retarded admins decided to make it default and force everyone to subscribe but even if im unsubscribed it will bombard rall every day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i completely forgotrememberedsaw a new rick and morty episodeand was like ahhh fuck nahh they dintlol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn that sucks man lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but all of that is theoretical would walk and did walk are two very different meanings you cant just proclaim these things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i walked the camino de santiago and honestly as long as there was a bike path that was not steep bikers are way more than x faster with even less exertion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe she just wanted to peg him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like youll be using a high horse rather than a bike
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really wish i could be there when you meet that one special person who changes you in ways you never imagined possible in reality you actually build relationships rather than magically finding a person theres no voodoo bond between two people or a fat kid with wings and a bow that we keep telling this to young impressionable people in hollywood films is probably why the divorce rate is at
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course im assuming youre part of the population that isnt a narcissistic psychopath if you are well imagine a world with no mirrors and everyone ignores you that should get you close to the same emotion would you mind elaborating on this no mirrors and everyone ignores me sounds lonely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that one special person is just as likely to exist as a unicorn is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,billion is still more than enough if there were like women left then sure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,please someone make this happen before dev patel gets too old to play the role india setting hippy trail crossing afghanistan pakistan and iran that would make a great movie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nothing against emma stone absolutely love her but i think alicia vikander would be a better option swedish ethnicity and all she can bring that comely feel to the role the former looks a bit too exotic if you will
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hollywood would cast matt damon to play pk though wed prefer if the male romantic interest isnt brown
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but my body is ready now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,irfaan khan seems more appropriate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but its ok peter sellers did it and he is awesome so no harm no foul
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that article is still pretty sensationalistic first of all shes of noble descent not royal secondly there was never a royal tradition that prohibited nonwhite people from residing with royals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,refugeemigrant joke lots of people have been dying trying to cross the mediteraneean to get to germany sweden since the crisis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are hating kohli right mate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or during the ice age when sea levels were much lower
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was wondering about that ocean bit there but then happened upon ur comment makes sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn thats some dedication to make that route the unnamed island is pulau maju onward island btw
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets talk stocks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they were writing mail to each other throughout his trip she knew hes coming from her photos its clear shes the type who doesnt smile for photos maybe something to do with her royal background
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some people are more facially expressive than others
UpliftingNews,not_removed,learn to reddit go to rall see that bit in the righthand corner that says displaying content from rall except the following subreddits under that enter upliftingnews into the box voila unfortunately if you do this you will have less things to whine and complain about oh no
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well apparently i also missed the exact year i guess theyve been married years not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im someone thats walked about miles over the last months currently walking across america id take the bike over walking

UpliftingNews,not_removed,love at first sight does exist i didnt believe it myself until a half dozen years ago and every relationship is work that goes without saying if you dont work at it it fails
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sorry to hear that you dont believe in or havent experienced that magical bond i have though so you are wrong that it doesnt exist only that it doesnt exist for you yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,try nawazuddin siddiqui hes the next irfaan khan looks more appropriate too

UpliftingNews,not_removed,do u shit upside down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is you still a fan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as unspoken things usually also are unwritten there is no decisive way to tell however there are plenty of events which would indicate the opposite sweden has had black chamberlains assessors and court secretaries as far back as the to my knowledge there are at least two marriages recorded between these people and female members of nobility
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because its too easy to make the trip now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tldr busy watching rick morty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i tried doing an ama when i was in albuquerque but i was told i cant do it on things that are in progress so ill do one when im finished i have a subreddit of my own though rskylertravels
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wanted to spend a lot more time on this trip and see a lot more with biking you tend to go through places a lot quicker and not spend as much time walking means i get to spend a lot more time in small towns and random areas besides ive already committed to walking i cant just say im walking across america then of the way through switch to a bike can i i will be biking across canada next summer though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he meant table fan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but the swedes extreme whiteness not that its a bad thing in itself would tell you that there was no significant intermixing at all having black people working in some professions doesnt mean that there wasnt racism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont be like that at least have the decency to watch the mummy trailer god damn it its been on the frontpage and only upvotes edit also remember to go buy a smart watch

UpliftingNews,not_removed,sweet im going to subscribe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that how youre getting home
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah yes the infamous sexual maneuver
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thing is for the most part they didnt exist sweden is a very faraway place especially by century standards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why are you treating sweden as if its an american state the native population is white and in the we didnt have the globalised world we have today whats next complaining about africa having too many blacks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i still have another months before im finished
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes definitely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no thats just my next big trip i like to plan one trip ahead im going to be finishing this one this summer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry if that what yo got from my message i mean that there are no black genetics in swedes this is possible if there were no blacks historically close to swedes or if there were there was no intermixing i am not complaining about sweden or africa about their ethnic composition also racism in the whole of the world was well documented in all civilization across europe africa and asia i am just saying that claiming sweden didnt have racism at that time is false
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats awesome how old are you just curious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i still dont see what your point is there were so few blacks in sweden at the time that that most people didnt even see any it wasnt until well after immigration started properly

UpliftingNews,not_removed,better link
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but can he fap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but trump is still president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to the best of my knowledge for this type of treatment to be effective it has to be administered within a specific time window postinjury this has a lot to do with the bodys response postinjury and how the nervous system is altered over weeksmonthsyears

UpliftingNews,not_removed,rpupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a sweetheart i just want to give her tons of smooches and cuddle her i cant believe someone mistreated a doge de bordeaux they are so sweet grew up with bullmastiffs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is beautiful and shame on us as a society universal healthcare if we dont take care of our own who will
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is it only americans think we shouldnt have universal healthcare can we find somebody in every other world nation that has universal healthcare every single country that advocates for a us like healthcare system americans are such products of their environment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,baffling how people think that healthcare is a privilage not a right the argument being you dont have a right to use someones services for free
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can say no one has a right to free services and you just sound like a terrible person hopefully you never have to watch someone you love be going through cancer and unable to afford treatment no one should have to die from an illness because they didnt have the money to pay someone to help them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,canadian here the longest wait times are typically for mri or other medical images wait list for an mri for my dad that was just diagnosed with myasthenia gravis was months he went to a private clinic because he could afford it but lots cant so they have to wait still though been in and out of the hospital plenty since then for tests and never cost anything out of pocket just for reference we do have to pay a monthly premium to have healthcare just like any insurance company in the states for my family of its dollars a month in british columbia just in case you wanted a dollar figure to compare
UpliftingNews,not_removed,two words universal healthcare
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea breaking bad is actually a really poignant show as it turns out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what i read high school students need to take care of principal by depriving themselves because being sick means being ruined in the us what some americans read america is the greatest our children are generous christians
UpliftingNews,not_removed,single payer healthcare will transform our society into a more caring one this uplifting news actually makes me feel sad and angry billionaires run our country our wealth flows upward our healthcare care system is the most expensive in the world we are forced into bankruptcy and must rely on donations and gofundme campaigns when we get sick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ahhh the joy of living in the us you get to be required to pay out of pocket for medical expenses as an added bonus you get lower life expectancy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cut to the one kid who still really wanted to go on the trip
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this would have really killed the plot of breaking bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this should be making the headlines of fox abc cnnetc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a karma grab this story came out like a year ago on reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is there any update on how the principal is doing now i know this story is several years old and was wondering how her progress is coming along and hopefully the cancer is in remission
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this repost is from years ago who really cares about karmapoints like this wtf
UpliftingNews,not_removed,beautiful gesture i hope these young men and women come to understand the principles behind universal healthcare and the impact that would have had on both the principal and the graduating class everyone would have won in this scenario
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everyone should be in canada
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if theres not video it just doesnt mean as much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty sure thats illegal i remember reading about a particular amount that can be accepted or gifted to or from between student and employee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is this really uplifting news that is a candle in the wind for the medical expenses this person will face
UpliftingNews,not_removed,such a beautiful and uplifting newsneed to unite across the world to fight this dreaded problem of cancer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,junіоrsеnіоr high school this amuses me i am guessing there is a perfectly understandable reason why not just high school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love this but amazing that universal healthcare doesnt exist in the us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just want to upvote a few my times thats all just a few
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wanted this to say peer instead of principal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great but just another example of how our country is failing us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont principals make a shit pile of money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the high school students of course the system works s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or falling that pay our teachers well enough to handle it without needing charity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the grim reaper will take care of them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,universal healthcare will leave so many people on a waiting list
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the us has systemic inequality at a massive level to keep people chill with this american culture has over time evolved to conflate wealth with moral fiber the american dream is work hard get rich ergo if youre rich you worked hard ergo if youre poor its because you didnt richmoral poorimmoral consequently most poor americans dont view themselves as poor because poorimmoral and of course one doesnt view oneself as immoral thus most poor americans feel poverty is a selfimposed problem and yet paradoxically views themselves as the exceptiona rich person at heart a rich person who just isnt rich yetand its all those other poor people who are doin it wrong and making the rest of us look bad and breaking the system if not for all these poor people wed all be rich in order to profit on the controversy generated by these divisions media companies stoke resentmentment so you hear phrases like welfare queens and anchor babies come into play tools to create an other eg brown people that lets them explain and justify their poverty as being someone elses fault because they have to because they also view poverty as a moral failing and need to rectify the ensuinh cognitive dissonance politicians then exploit this resentment for personal gain and in the process devise new persuasive rhetorical gambits that are purposebuilt to convince people to vote against their own interest for example you dont want the government to impose its education system on you you want the freedom to choose an education system thats right for you and your family and so at last we arrive at healthcare the question comes should we nationalize it to which the poor american answers fuck no all these fucking poor people will take advantage of it and screw me over its this kind of cultist mindset that turns the populace against itself and fosters stagnation as we all sit and argue who among us is the most worthy and the libertarianlaissez faire response tends to be that someday if the chains are removed once and for all the great unshackled market will in all its wisdom and benevolence find an equitable solution that benefits everyone and is simultaneously maximally profitable and maximally ethical somehow because like how could it not or to out it more succinctly if you deserve to live the market will allow you to live basically its ayn rands fault
UpliftingNews,not_removed,universal healthcare is something i am all for until its executed my first thought is paying more for healthcare so that my neighbor can get cancer treatment and my parents can get their meds every weekwell thats just being a decent human being however my familys premiums under mandated healthcare are more than we can afford a friend of mine has a premium thats well over her mortgage payment my job offers health insurance but mine was cut last year because i didnt work enough gave birth and took a week baby vacation silly me my point is that universal health care should be but something here isnt going as planned american hereprobably should have lead with that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its definitely not a right but it should be part of the social contract
UpliftingNews,not_removed,baffling how people think that they have a right to others labor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obama literally saved my life with aca it may not be the epitome of what our health care system should be but i would have died from colon cancer had it not been for the exemption for preexisting conditions and being able to afford insurance and i didnt have to go into debt for decades to pay off some astronomical copay and max outofpocket expense if i ever meet that man i dont think ill be able to do anything but break down and cry out of gratitude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people should have to take care of all sorts of things for themselves but not an illness when you are sick let others care for you thats how it should work at a person to person level and thats how it should work at a societal level
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to compare to an american example when i was just a student last year my premium for only myself a young healthy person was with a deductible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,canadian here as well my dad was seen in an emergency room for what was unknown at the time mri ordered was completed within hours brain surgery the next morning i needed an mri that was nonurgent was asked how far i was willing to drive for it because it wasnt urgent i gave them a radius i had my mri within a month if i had insisted on having it done at my local hospital it wouldve taken longer neither mri nor the brain surgery cost us anything out of pocket but for gas and parking dad had brain tumourcancer all the cancer treatment was at no cost he still died six months later but we werent bankrupt for it also all the driving and gas was a federal tax writeoff for medical treatment expenses along with the foodrestaurant etc expenses incurred dealing with the cancer treatment years earlier i needed nonurgent surgery the surgery wasnt offered where i live so i was flown to another province put up in hotel ground transport surgery hospital stay recall appointments for a year no cost to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i work with guys who always bring up the wait times when i talk about universal healthcare one guy has had back issues for three years that he cant afford to get treated another guy needs to have surgery on his hand and is also waiting to save up some money to go they fail to see the irony
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like how one of the republicans points against healthcare is wait times mother fuckers how about now we cant even have the option to wait and if youre a rich prick who dont want to wait just pony up or keep your fucking insurance they are trying to push this savings account bullshit for healthcare i mean what the fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,two words meth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one country canada edit im not saying canada is the only country to have universal healthcare im telling you to search up the state of their great free healthcare to anyone who actually cares about the subject research canada healthcare wait times on google
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah those two words are easy to say but i dont think the common people would understand how difficult it would be to implement something like this convincing people is already hard enough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you think about it america is the only place in the world where something like breaking bad is possible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,try going to canada and see the great universal healthcare good luck getting your flu checked out within a week of requesting aid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,years ago in the principal was already cured of cancer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be fair it did this was a few years back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no and definitely not enough to put up with all the bullshit they get from parents and students
UpliftingNews,not_removed,blaah hahahahaha nice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no one can afford it hundreds of thousands of dollars potentially even with insurance thats why over of people with bankruptcies related to healthcare debt had insurance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if teachers were payed that much our counties and cities would bank rupt also principles are payed handsomly and get great retirement plans they dont need raises
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right now our mandated charity is being used to kill people in other countries were fine with that though and damn anyone that would see that money be put towards keeping anyone alive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you make a compelling case
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah for procedures that arent time sensitivenot fucking cancer treatment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id rather have to wait a bit and get free healthcare then not see a doctor at all or not get my medication at all because i have no health insurance and cant afford them or my insurance wont cover my prescription ive dealt with both or wait to get free surgery rather than get it sooner and go thousands or tens of thousands into debt because of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as oppose to people not going to the doctor because they cant affordaccess it if anything wait lists can be an example a country has wide reaching healthcare system because people are actually getting treated for their illnesses
UpliftingNews,not_removed,much better than not having anyone on a waiting list since no one is fucking going because of cost you realize that buying a casket or simple cremation is cheaper than a fucking hospital bill
UpliftingNews,not_removed,universal healthcare is not perfect i can myself attest to that since i got skipped in a system because my problem was not serious enough but i prefer that rather than bankrupting myself id something bad happens
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but theyll be on it or die like an american citizen in the streets or the waiting rooms or in bed too young because you couldnt afford the copay or the deductible thats a very satanic thing to say good for you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hear hear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you want the freedom to choose an education system thats right for you and your family how else are we supposed to keep our children safe from the school bears
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great answer mate thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well explained sirmam
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for the posting i dont make a lot of money and ive devoted my life to a career that ill never get rich at i pay my bills and all my taxes am able to feed and clothe my son so that he can concentrate on his education and social development as he grows i worry about his spiritual development as much as the physical i realize things could be far worse for us as much as i am aware that a little extra money could ease many of the uncertainties we have i believe i am the luckiest man alive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,interesting phrase i like the idea behind that i was fishing for a counter argument so thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah free services from other humans is not a right ever a right involves you doing what you want without harming others not you getting free services i like your phrasing of social contract better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they dont the laborers are still paid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,baffling how people think someone should die because they didnt have enough money because money is the ultimate indicator of how good of a person you are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its hard to believe if someone has the power to help somebody else they wont unless they get money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre an ass
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the basic rights of liberty and property nothing else
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that makes me really happy thats the coolest thing ive read all day im really glad youre ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he didnt save my life but without aca i would be blind or myself and my family homeless i hope some day i will meet president obama so that i can say thank you face to face
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this made me really happy thanks for sharing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im in terrible debt from my current brain cancer battle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its always weird to see the mental gymnastics of people who think free market is a bulletproof response against what every other sane modern western country does—universal healthcare—when you point out that you dont fucking pay the police of fire department when you call them because ya know at that point youre not really so much as engaging in the free marketplace but in a fucking crisis and need assistance healthcare is literally no different except that nixon sold the idea of created a permanent market for it in opposition to the successful british model
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my premium is covered by my employer they also cover an additional of the family plan im signed up for for my wife and kids my premium is still just over a month we have a deductible and now i has a sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i choked really badly on a peanut when i was a little under years old it went into my lung they choppered me to childrens hospital in vancouver preformed emergency surgery and kept me there for a few days this was while my dad was going to school so we had literally no money i cant imagine what that would have cost my parents if they didnt live here i wont ever complain about the healthcare here even if there are sometimes long waits in emergency or at the walk in clinic if its urgent its treated as such and you go right in ive never had an issue in my years as a side note my wife is from the usa and i have dual citizenship there and she is a dual here when we had our son the only thing she would talk about was how much it was going to cost us and that she was determined to get out of the hospital in day she seriously didnt believe it was possible to have a baby have an emergency dampc and stay there for days and it cost us nothing out of pocket her sister had a baby in the usa a few months later which was apparently fully covered under their medical plan but it still cost them dollars i dont understand how it cost that much if its fully covered doesnt that mean fully i guess that was their deductible perhaps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bitch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sigh canadas health care is just fine is it perfect no could it use reform yes is it pretty sweet to walk into a clinic or hospital anywhere in the country and walk out without a bill a couple hours later hell ya source canadian
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did some research seems pretty good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,canadian here if you go to emergency with a detached digit or limb or profuse bleeding heart attack etc you will get immediate care if you have a broken bone and they dont judge it as lifethreatening you will be seen after they handle the people with the detached digits and limbs there are not an infinite number of doctors and nurses in the er and btw when you leave the hospital you will owe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the httpsenwikipediaorgwikifraserinstitute is a politically conservative org and so its biased in its reporting if you want a more realistic view offers a rebuttal of common myths about universal healthcare in canada also
UpliftingNews,not_removed,canadian here our ers can have longer wait times sure but most other parts of our healthcare is pretty great like i see my doctors whenever i dont have to pay for it out of pocket my prescriptions are generally well priced and mostly covered like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just depends on where and what time i mean ive had to wait hours for stitches the wound pretty much closed up on its own then ive cut a piece of my thumb off when slicing potatoes and was there and back in under it was a min drive one way to the hospital
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you realize getting universal healthcare doesnt mean we have to directly copy it from another country right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man youre fucking dense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its amazing that this waitlist bullshit is mainly spouted by people who dont actually use the canadian healthcare system i dont actually hear people here complaining about it youd fare very poorly in a survey of canadians asking if theyd prefer a private model most of us actually push for more socialization so that pharmacare is available for nonseniors
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not particularly difficult to compare systems and see that something is seriously wrong with ours
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant remember where i readheard it but the concept that while at war there is no budget for the war but while at peace there is a budget for healthcare etc is largely the problem if the united states made universal healthcare a priority and simply made it happen it could happen aircraft carrier needs to be replaced bam money citizens need healthcare sorry youre on your own
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah man those canadians are just dying in droves arent they
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol man youve got a hate on for canadian health care it is literally nothing like that keep reaching maybe youll eventually grab something true good luck paying for your treatment costs ill be over here paying taxes so everyone can receive health care and walking out with a bill
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i lived in canada because im american i paid to see the doctors unlike canadians whose visits were covered the cost for an hour visit with a specialist in canada cost less than the copay for a minute visit with a us doctor care was superior and meds are cheaper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,troll
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who goes to the hospital for the flu someone who wants to give everyone else the flu
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i get an appointment with my family health care team same day most of the time clinic runs hours a day i have access to back up physicians on the team and a walkin clinic on sundays or after hours most testing including xrays can be done walkin same day too canadas great thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why would you go to a fucking hospital for the flu if you werent eighty or bringing your deathly ill baby
UpliftingNews,not_removed,make k in jersey
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am the aristotle of our time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lmao likw you have anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry dude the socialists downvoted us into oblivion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then you are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so very well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre arguing with socialist or possibly marxist they dont believe in property rights like free marketeers do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks im keeping fit and trying everything i can to stay that way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,me too good luck to you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre welcome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can request a hardship forgiveness of debt from the hospital usually the doctors involved will honor it but not always good luck to you i hope things go well for you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most free market champions ive met dont realize free markets dont exist there is nothing free market about a nobid government contract for an aircraft carrier payed for by taxpayer money apparently paying for that aircraft carrier completely fits into free market economics but paying for an individuals health insurance through a national program is totally against free market principles i have come to the realization that people just like to see the less fortunate suffer until they are the less fortunate then they loooove welfare programs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im single and i pay and get yr in an hsa to pay towards my deductible moop is something like that would definitely suck but i can afford it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it just depends our first kid with my old insurance cost total but the last one under the affordable care act was like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tight
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this its nice not to have to choose between life and the mortgage paymentputting food on the table
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cost of birth by csection in us cost in canada
UpliftingNews,not_removed,canada is cheap to get healthcare but canadas health care system wait times is terrible its free but its shit if i were to ever break my legs in canada i would go to a private healthcare provider unless i feel like i can wait three hours just to see a doctor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets just try communism while were at it we dont have to directly copy it from another country i dont understand that logic but hey you are free to believe in what you want im just saying out of my experience and what i know canada is not where id go for urgent care what makes our healthcare great but expensive is the fact that its privatized and on demand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while i agree with that but once again i dont think the common people know that our health care system is a black hole for money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whereas an american would spend a week worrying between literally maybe dying or shelling out a few thousand bucks they dont have
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you misspelled asshole
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah man doctors are the real victims in our country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,luckily my deductible is a family not individual so my oop is roughly the same as yours
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have waited that long in an emergency room in america before
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive waited more than three hours to see a doctor here in the states with insurance and still footed the bill since i have a deductible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a canadian i have mixed feelingsive seen people with broken limbs and pretty bad sicknesses wait a few hours just to be seen for minutes if theyre lucky but you do get treated on the other hand my mom was diagnosed with cancer and she had life saving surgery the week after followed by prompt and excellent treatment for the next months shes doing fine and hasnt missed a beat all because they caught the tumor during a free checkup before it spread and got down to surgery and treatment right away all that to say our biggest expense was fucking parking im pretty sure if we were americans wed be bankrupt and my mom would be dying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so what youre basically saying is that you have the money for private healthcare but you dont want those others with no healthcare to have to wait too long so its better here where they have none you still have to wait but hey at least you can occupy your time researching which overpass to park your shopping cart under after you lose everything amirite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is for specialized treatment or elective surgery though you cant cherry pick the worst part of one countrys healthcare system to totally write off universal healthcare when we have so many models to choose from anyway canada is a pretty low bar when looking for examples to copy from so many countries offer more costeffective universal health care without the same issues that canada has
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hmm waiting to hours to fix broken legs or an arm and a leg cost for potentially fast appointment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you do realize we also have private healthcare right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and that its not even accessible for million people your tune would change pretty fucking quickly if you were in that group suddenly those supposed wait times wouldnt seem so bad but thats a lesson in empathy youll have to learn the hard way because theres no way some asshole on the internet will drill that one into your head
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its fine for your useless war machine though right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aww its gonna be okay pookie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i waited or when i thought my arm was broken
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had a hernia after a gastric bypass and almost died waiting in the er waiting room for hours a little girl who was there before me very obviously had a ruptured appendix and didnt get taken in until half an hour before me not sure why they think waiting a few hours is limited to canada
UpliftingNews,not_removed,chances are you were triaged theyll know if its life threatening source emt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant tell if youre trolling me but try making a comparison to healthcare provided by the canadian government if you think waiting hours is bad have fun waiting months
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill be honest the healthcare in the states this past decade sucks high deductibles high premiums high copays
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its hilarious that when i went to the hospital recently for a uti they literally saw me in minutes i was complaining that the parking dollars and then i had a major reality check
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this my son was sick for over weeks before they found out he had a cancerous tumor neuroblastoma we were in hospital and i was off work for thst whole time they thought the issue was something to do with the intestinal tract and finally the day before we were airlifted to sick kids hospital in toronto they found the tumor another weeks later he was out of the hospital fully recovered from surgery that removed it and fine as can be compared to the symptoms and such from before he was admitted now if we were not in canada and in the us our bill would have been in the hundreds of thousands easily for the dozens of tests they did and the surgery now hes going through chemotherapy as the tumor has shown growth but we still are not majorly in debt and can still feed our kids aside from taking the time off work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its the people who think their illness deserves to be treated before anyone else that think theyre getting a bad deal let mr hashcatchem get cancer here in the us without insurance if youre lucky a university teaching hospital might take you but youre getting students with a guiding hand from faculty no matter how good they may be theres no comparison to a guy thats been doing surgery for years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very true i see your point i only use canada because most of the other countries that offer universal healthcare are smaller than california i didnt realize the australian government also offered healthcare
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hashcatchem uses slippery slope its not very effective
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not after that man over there rams his one eyed prairie snake so far up your rectum you start refering to it as uncle gag reflex you know why they call him bloody bum joe no no worries you will soon enough pookie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know thanks to obama theres no cure for whats wrong with you unfortunately
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep exactly my point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obviously capitalism solves all problems
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right doesnt disprove my point i guarantee in canada they dont just let people bleed out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you said hours though seems like you need to move the goalposts to prove your point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this past decade its almost like youre trying to encompass the aca and only the aca while you ignore the awful things that were happening before it nostalgia has no place in a topic like this save that for movies and videogames before the aca premiums were going up at even faster rates people with preexisting conditions were sentenced to a life of never ending poverty suffering or death scam plans were rampant million people had health coverage in which is a fucking travesty when you realize that something like car insurance has been mandated in states and the other only let you off the hook if you show them that you can pay for potential damages otherwise the affordability of american healthcare hasnt really improved at all since when they passed the ematala act and thats a fun one to point out because people cry and cry and cry about how they dont want to indirectly pay for other peoples healthcare but at the same time youll never hear a peep from them when it comes to those emergency room bills either theyre too ignorant or they just dont have the balls to say let them die
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah ive had universal health care coverage my whole life i honestly cant imagine footing a bill for healthcare the last time i was in hospital for a few broken bones in my hand i got ambulance to hospital operation and cast and i didnt pay a cent hell they paid for my taxi home voucher im very happy to pay taxes if that means someone else gets care like that if they are in a similar situation we all look after each other guess its a different mentality in the us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all that did was give me an erection
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it got us our wonderful president we have today didnt it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you bleed out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,healthcare is a profit driven enterprise your insurance company doesnt give a fuck about you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes im dead now thanks for asking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,although his resume probably is more impressive then mine this still depresses me in my endless search for a stable income
UpliftingNews,not_removed,job searches are so discouraging try to take a lesson from his story instead consider that he got this job by thinking outside the box placing an ad instead of just replying to one granted this may only have worked for him because he is years old but consider also how his success came from making it personal and not being afraid to put himself out there i used to get really tense at interviews and just sort of nervously rattle off this list of qualities i felt i had to offer the company but the best advice i think ive gotten about interviewing was theyre not hiring a skill set theyre hiring a person i have had better luck focusing less on impressing potential employers and more on just being myself and being someone you would want around not being afraid to make a joke or two keep the faith
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tears
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is good i had to deal with a likely related student loan phone scam for many months they kept calling and got increasingly aggressive when i told them i would like to be taken off the call list
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but in the last two weeks those calls have dropped off by it sounds like that place was behind most of the calls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aww no more dickheads to troll
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are these the same people doing the microsoft support scam or versions of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more likely because of the bust see link
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kinda proves that shooting like this could be avoided if people listened to and gave support to those who become gunmen they are basically acting out in a horrible horrible way due to the issues they face if the issues were helped they wouldnt act out like that please dont take my use of the phrase acting out as lessening the damage its just seems most descriptive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as for hudgens whos been at sycamore middle for years of them as a counselor she hasnt said much about what she told the student during that potentially lifesaving chat and in a video posted to the schools facebook page she deflected attention away from herself praising instead the actions of her fellow staff members and law enforcement what a beautiful person lucky school and kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hopefully she isnt neutropenic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i was about my teacher invited all her students to her wedding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it hurts my cynical soul to say thisbut that shit is genuinely heart warming

UpliftingNews,not_removed,special ed teachers are incredible not only do they need to be able to teach they have to know each student on a very personal level special ed teacher need to be a combination of a teacher nurse care taker and therapist they really do amazing work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aww
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok is it just me or does it seem like women that work with special ed people generally tend to be more attractive i work at a zoo so i see a lot of this and its just something that has always stood out to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a wonderful woman her husband is a lucky fellow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is awesome reminds me of when my first grade teacher invited all of us to her wedding a couple years down the line because we were her first class ever and she even made an appearance at my grad and presumably everyone elses party
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she could be my teacher anyday wait
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does she want a pat on the back

UpliftingNews,not_removed,the size of my smile looking at these pictures is just so big
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for some teaching is a job and for others it is a calling she is clearly the latter and not the former
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anyone else remember tard blog i miss that thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel nothing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the first picture is amazing thats exactly how i imagined it would look as well

UpliftingNews,not_removed,adorable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,special people for her special day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it really was her special day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,am i the only one who thinks this crosses professional boundaries i worked as an aide in special ed you love the kids but it doesnt seem appropriate to include students of any sort in such a personal part of your life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems like of special education female teachers are hot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i was in year our design and tech teacher was getting married and we tried to convince her that she should invite us all she refused and a few weeks after her wedding we found out that two of the students had gone every other one of us were jealous but it wasnt a big deal she was a good teacher and now were getting people to sign a petition so that she could stay at our school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn the teachers pretty cute is she single
UpliftingNews,not_removed,frenchs students took to the dance floor to show off their dance moves including the dab and the whip and the naenae but did they do the mashed potato
UpliftingNews,not_removed,only on the frontpage because shes hot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,special education kids are extremely hard to take care of one of my coworkers daughter was a teacher she taught special ed but one of her students went on a rampage slamming her self into the wall and ground leaving bruises and marks all over her one day she flew off the wall and wouldnt get out of a trash can and the parents and other students were starring and it looked bad so the parents complained and had the principle come and have the cops called and escort her the office all the teachers knew that she was a problem child and that she didnt do anything they parents eventually realized this when the mom came to pick up the child and the child punched the mom in face but its hard to deal with them especially if anything happens the teacher is the one to blame but in the end it hurts the kid because no teacher wants to go near or help the kid because they dont want to have the same thing happened to them and they get in trouble and fired from the job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,viralweddinggimmick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,such a sweet story and she looks so happy though theyre so mini is sticking in my brain and not in a good way is that even a sentence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in the age of the internet i cant help birthing she did it to gain notoriety but then again shes a special ed teacher solo im just a cynical asshole i guess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eugenics is a great thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id do her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the students told the news station that their favorite parts of the big day included the food mashed potatoes i feel bad for drawing attention to it but come on seriously
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id beat all kids on the left until they acted human for the photographer the two on the right pass as normal id also spank the bride if ya know what i mean
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is retarded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,groom who invited all the retards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,groom who invited all the retards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,imagine how annoying that was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they look pretty retarded

UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats special
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lucky groom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she married all of those kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anyone want to guess why they were late to the wedding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,may she be happily married due to such a good deed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those kids must be very special to her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is this uplifting news tho real uplifting news would be like support for victims of child abuse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cultural appropriation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cheap labor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why on earth would she do that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought its about a special teacher named ed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would like to be at her wedding too the one getting married to her wait is this creepy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im so glad that is in glamour magazine that is truly a glamorous thing to do god bless her better than what i assumed would be in that kind of named magazine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aaaaaahhhh token is at its best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what kind of teacher likes their students that much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i lost it when it said mashed potatoes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats incredibly unprofessional
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how come all her students are white
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im super jealous its not me marrying her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is retarded cute
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lbh those kids were not doing the dab the whip and the nae nae
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she is such a human being look at her be a human being wow such human beeing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy shit how much did she waste on that wedding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mine did the same but not all of the students were invited and a lot of the parents of the noninvited kids got so wicked angry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same here if i think back it wasnt free getting a bus to get children to a wedding plus additional teachers for support long time ago though i dont think this would be a feasible idea today
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the more i hear about how peoples teachers and friends were so kind to them the more i wonder if i was a shitty kid or if i just went to a district with shitty people overall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same happened to me we were like and the whole class was invited that was fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my teacher didnt invite us but we knew it was happening one of our other teachers told us super secretly he was everyones favourite teacher who had him grade french immersion so we bribed our gym teacher to take our cash and drive off campus during lunch to buy decorations like streamers and little cheesy wedding things you stick on the wall we got a big weddinglike arch from the drama room to put over his desk and decorated his classroom when he saw it he broke down and started smiling like an idiot which is a huge deal because hes known for being big and tough it had to be one of the best moments of my life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my first grade teacher did the same we all sang whatever you call the song that the bride and groom walk back down the aisle and out of the church to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,usually my favorite part of any wedding too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right such a nice article and then that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,potatoooooo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i physically laughed for the first time in reddit days i guess we are all bastards on this blessed day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was just sitting here blown away by how much difference a chromosome can make
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not at all i laughed out loud and felt bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,chuckled this is the first time in at least a year something on reddit has brought me to tears from laughing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i concur and my soul is foul
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if it helps i heard that they forced them to fight and solve puzzles for entertainment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know right im not even a special ed teacher and even still i want to invite my local special ed students to my wedding thats how heartwarming it is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it hurts my agnostic soul to think theres a special place for people like this in heaven
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if it helps you can still be cynical about the post title it was only some of her kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you want the cynic cycle to get going again remember that this meant she basically had to work on her wedding day still cool though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a grumpy piece of shit this morning and i think its a load of bollocks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but what about the commodification of the less fortunate my cynical side can still find it but god damn it this is very heartwarming
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt think i was that bitter but i guess i am it doesnt help that i used to be a teacher and i used to hate teachers who make the job their entire life like that from the outside they portray themselves as self sacrificing but they are not giving up anything they want they usually have some kind of home life they dont want to be involved in and they are addicted both to the constant sense of being needed and relied upon and of being in control i look at a picture like this and just pity her husband having to deal with it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it makes me feel the way taylor swift wants you to feel about her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,small world i was one of joshs groomsmen i went to college with both of them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you have to love what you do to be able to do it working with special needs students is brutal for people who arent into it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i heard they got down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just trying to get attention
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but shes got kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,waitsince when do special ed teachers get shit on they certainly have shit pay but i think the majority of society respects and appreciates what they do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,never really heard of special ed teachers getting shit on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,go you i have mad respect for everyone who is and aspires to be part of this field
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im imagining the reporter with a checklist of dances deciding that their electric slide was incomplete and wouldnt count
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the really great thing about this is these children are often excluded from their own families weddings worry over behavior this sweet bride showed everyone what love and kindness looks like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok that made me laugh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fellow tatted metalhead and biker special needs kids were around me a lot as a child i have a cousin who is special needs and three of my best friends throughout grade school were as well we didnt attend the same high school the last time i saw one of them he had become a painter and his landscapes were amazing he was actually having a showing i was fortunate enough to attend they taught me a lot about how awesome life can be just by embracing everyday things as awesome and wearing your heart on your sleeve
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no shit there are kids with downs syndrome doing dances i cant damn it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol nothing to do with priorities
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ruthless love it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its like one big potato soup
UpliftingNews,not_removed,herself or her guests
UpliftingNews,not_removed,savage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a feeling a writer for glamour wasnt referencing an obscure meme to insult some special ed kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just realized that ive never been to a wedding like ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dafuq are you talking about almost the entirety of the comments present in a positive light are you just purposely trying to trigger yourself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,potato
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all the potatoes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,perfectly executed joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was a short limo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lmao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its actually special education theyre teachers who focus on students with disabilities or other conditions that would make it hard for them to learn in a normal environment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,depends on the kid cause its usually individualized but i teach one of my girls basic writing so letter recognition counting to using pictures and signs to communicate theyre in grade my more advanced kids i teach regular curricular but at a much slower pace social skills art music its pretty similar to teaching regular classes but its individualized at a slower pace
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they met the minority quota for a video because there was a black hand in it chillen bro
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she really doesnt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no need to wish
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the teacher is a media horny attention seeker
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh come on its a special day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,peoke do stuff like this to get attention
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are so miniature yep thats a sentence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a former sped teacher i always see the people saying im an angel etc and the desire to publicize stuff like this and exalt those of us who work with people with disabilities as perpetuating the stigma around people with disabilities im not a hero and neither is this teacher if everyone could start seeing people with disabilities as people this wouldnt be newsworthy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and a birther as well apparently
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really hope you are talking about the bride
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shed probably oblige it seems she likes working with retards maybe she wants one of her own
UpliftingNews,not_removed,edgy cynicism levels off the charts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems like you may have a warped view of the world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats worse than commenting on the hotness of a child commenting on the hotness of a disabled child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh redditnever change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ummmmok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you think she would have invited a bunch of black retarded kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boston
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the following parent teacher conferences mustve been interesting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i was a teacher that would be one hell of a backhand to all the parents i thought needed to get their kids in line
UpliftingNews,not_removed,understandable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why though wedding are only fun if youre of drinking and mingling age and we just went to the ceremony and not the reception
UpliftingNews,not_removed,guess people shouldnt have shitty ass kids lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she has special ed classes im sure her classes are much smaller and their parents would jump at the chance to have their kiddos at her wedding and attend as their plus one if i had the gift of being special enough to teach these kids id want them at my wedding and i wouldnt have any problems working an extra people into my wedding budget
UpliftingNews,not_removed,inviting them to the wedding and having them in the wedding is different
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why wouldnt it be feasible today itd just cost money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about the fermented potatoes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,were not so different after all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i bet the author has no clue as to the true genius of that article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think thats the thing i say most i work from home so dont talk to anyone during the work day and i have a dog called potato who is always doing something bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,speak for yourself

UpliftingNews,not_removed,let me ease your suffering i work with special needs i have many colleagues that do fantastic and amazing things that you will never see published on these fluffy bullshit excuses for journalism teachers who work with my younger clients who write hand written letters to the kids during the summer break people from my company bringing clients home over the holidays because their familys have just had enough of it all people who actually move in with clients as room mates to give them a chance of independent living which is by the way an almost total sacrifice of at home nonwork life but you dont get to see any of that because we dont take photo documentation of it while we smile benevolently down upon hard set upon charges disseminating the images to anyone and everyone with half a brain so we get to be told how much of a goodperson we are your wedding is about you this everybody worship me for i am the retard shepherd is an outstanding display of self aggrandizing bull shit and if this is what pierces your black heart youre pretty weak
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks it does help
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shit was not uplifting at all until i knew this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is no heaven
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im kinda with you my wife does this exact work in a high school so im totally down with the kids and the people who work with them but i think you really hit on something this is a wedding between two people yet the focus is on the kids and percent of the wedding party is nowhere to be seen this would appear to be more about narcissism yeah this husband is in for a rough time btw before you downvote simply because i disagree with the majority here please know i live this life my wife works very hard doing this work and i see her all the time struggle to keep it from consuming her these kids need so much that it can be very easy to lose yourself in helping them and the lines begin to blur some years back we had to institute a no work talk policy at home because it became all we were talking about people who genuinely care can so easily get consumed by this job and not even realize it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,brilliantly put
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought taylor swift only wanted you to feel that way in your trousers and shes doing great at that by the way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no way josh is my drug dealer small world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one thing people dont realize about special ed is the mountain of paperwork that goes along with it everything needs to be documented and you need to be on top of your game and organized and you need to factor in all of the accommodations for every individual student in your caseload special ed teachers also must delegate and oversee the work of sped tutorsparas so thats even more planning and materials prep time all of this is in addition to the challenges of working with that student population to begin with its a shitload of work and this is just from my outside observations as a regular ed teacher
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agree ill admit im very uncomfortable around mentally challenged people most jobs i think i could force myself to do but special education is just something you have to be passionate about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hadnt heard the joke and i laughed so thanks heres an upvote
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and they are all retarded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have shit pay ours is a money driven society that shows what we value through what we spend our money on if we actually valued those who worked hard in such difficult situations then we would pay them appropriately instead we pay them shit heck i would bet that sociopathic cell phones sales people make more money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i work for a health care company that staffs workers my particular department provides staff for people with disabilities and my boss was a special ed teacher before working for this company according to her the job sucks because of the school regulations and sometimes laws regarding how they teach the system doesnt always allow teachers to teach the way would be most beneficial and so it can burn out the teachers with frustration when they can see what they think would be a better way to work with their students but arent allowed to i never asked specifics so i cant provide any but i understood from her that sometimes certain students or entire classes get fucked over because one regulation prevents the teacher from changing hisher methods and the teachers cant just stop caring so it just becomes too much shit to deal with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,since when do special ed teachers get shit on depends on the how special the kids are normally theyll shit on the floor or if youre lucky theyll wear nappies and shit in those
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do they get paid less than normal teachers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in a store
UpliftingNews,not_removed,porque no los dos
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i loled pretty hard at that i hope it was it meant to be a joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah its such a shame to be excluded over something you have no control over just doing one good thing for these children can make a huge difference in their life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ya man i ride too aint it funny how society as a whole looks as us and our brothers as if we are going to take their walletspurses but its been my experience that bikers mcs across patches support children across the board society could take a page from guys like us kick ass when its necessary and take a knee with the wounded whenever possible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was joking but now that i think about it she mightve actually broken that record
UpliftingNews,not_removed,heh sort by controversial papi
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so a car
UpliftingNews,not_removed,look again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this a million times over
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hahaha fuckin a man thinking goddamn how the fuck did i miss that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow some people cant take a joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did dis dude just did dis it was a joke i made in bad taste but you just had to take to a whole nother level in an attempt belittle me for my awful joke most ironically charade you are sir
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there wasnt many hot chicks in school it was deep rural north carolina
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i said when she grows up come on man dont make me out to be a retard pedo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,retarded love is the best kind of love
UpliftingNews,not_removed,am i right or am i right lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great band
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just a little outside boston so pretty much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,beat me to it i know a bostonian whem i hear one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my boys wicked smaht
UpliftingNews,not_removed,vaginal kids arent for everyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she had in her class
UpliftingNews,not_removed,little bus is cheaper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,from my experience teaching anything personal with the kids is usually frowned upon i worked at schools and both would have had an issue with students getting invited to a teachers wedding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the wedding happened in a curch used to be no problem you had foreign child per school but this has since been inverted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant say how feasible it is but it is weird to think about getting to miss school for a teachers wedding especially whole classes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are there any other type of potatoes out there worth consuming what am i saying of course there are ive never had a bad potato
UpliftingNews,not_removed,our pastor says to speak unto others as you speak unto yourself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the childrens favorite food at the wedding was mashed potatoes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean blood is blood it really doesnt matter what orifice or body part you lick it from now who or what you lick it from that is the rub now isnt it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had no idea you knew this person and what their intentions were if you do know this person thanks for sharing if you do not know this person that is an awful thing to assume and there is absolutely no need whatsoever to shit all over this special moment between a teacher and her students as someone that worked with patients with severe traumatic brain injuries i involved them in my family get togethers because they became family to me and no doubt in my mind if i had married while working there some of them would have attended my wedding as well moral of the story is that there are legitimately good people out there and its definitely not your place to judge
UpliftingNews,not_removed,calm down holden caulfield i totally upvoted though you make some good points
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and the loser got left back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shoot i misread
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude thats crazy i just masturbated to joshs wife
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my mom went from being a special ed teacher to overseeing special ed for the entire school system every time i talk to her something about paperwork this or iep that gets brought up cant say that would be my cup of tea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think a lot of people are but the thing is they are so unlikely to judge even if you make a fool of yourself just say hi my name is they may or may not respond but theyll be happy you made the effort
UpliftingNews,not_removed,😕😦😟
UpliftingNews,not_removed,finger hovers over upvote button
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the absolute madman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i work in special ed its not shit pay at first its just that it doesnt go very high after several years i still like it though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no certain jobs impress people more regardless of pay if the more selfless romantic jobs paid the same as the soulless ones we wouldnt be able to convince anyone to sell their soul p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in some ways its a good thing you want teachers who genuinely care rather than those who are just in it for the money foster care can be a mixed bag for this very reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,special ed is incredibly expensive low student teacher ratio and has near zero return on investment special ed teachers make the same or more as regular ed teachers cell phone salespeople arent getting rich
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not sure exactly how their pay compares directly but teachers in general get shit pay considering the importance of their job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i believe they actually get paid the same amount as regular teachers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wife has taught in four different districts in different parts of the country and zero of her special ed jobs have paid more than typical teachers she also has literally had to deal with shit in high school also is required lots of after hours stuff for each student
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unless you work in chicago doesnt matter what kind of teacher you are theres about chance youre getting booted for reasons thanks a lot rahm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she ran into them with a car while they were in a store thats highly improbably were they injured
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i honestly thought it was supposed to contrast the awesome teacher in ops post like my orchestra teacher accidentally hit one of their students with a car on their honeymoon im glad that wasnt the case
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably not i imagine a couple of people with downs syndrome have married each other in a town hall before now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah it was supposed to be ironic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you were able to laugh at your own shitty jokesyoud still be disabled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stop your waifu pillow is getting jealous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my boys wicked smaht
UpliftingNews,not_removed,smaht cahs smaht phones smaht homes technology makes everything smaht kid but losin ya stuff makes ya feel wicked stupid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so whats going on with boston and weddings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tbf wicked is a pretty new england thing in general im from nh and ive said it my whole life but i second the thought about finding it weird that it wasnt a nationwide thing after leaving
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have no boston accent at all either and still accidentally drop a wicked in fact i thought this post was implying inviting your students to a wedding was a boston thing at first because i skimmed right over wicked i was about to call them out and say id never heard of that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im from maine we say wicked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,from northern ny everyone says wicked here too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,even when i read it in my head i hear the accent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah we say it in southern rhode island too which i never thought was weird until i went to college in sc and everyone thought it was the funniest thing ever and they always used it wrong theyd always say thats wicked id yell goddamnit its an adverb not an adjective or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we say wicked in upstate ny too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not just boston im in southern nh and have been saying wicked for as long as i can remember might just be a new england thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive noticed it with australians too weird
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im from buffalo ny and i say wicked all the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pro tip a lot absolute bullshit if i added more people to my wedding it would have cost me none more dollars
UpliftingNews,not_removed,glad im not the only one who thought that i also work in special ed and we have so many policies against this to prevent weird boundaries and blurred lines super cute and sweet but where i come from shed be unemployed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed ive worked in special education classrooms and in residential programs for kids and im told not to even reveal if i have pets let alone where i live what age i am or that i am in a relationship but i do love that these kids were invited to their teachers wedding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can i just ask since youre a teacher ive seen ted talk about how teachers bring fear upon parents for their kids performances and behaviour so the parents do their best to show up on time for parent teacher meetings but ive heard some teachers are shit scared of parents who are state or federal judges and let them dictate when the meetings should be held and for how long whats going on here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i doubt they missed school for the wedding very few people celebrate nuptials midweek
UpliftingNews,not_removed,baked potatoes are best potatoes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,from the turin horse the best film ever about getting dressed eating potatoes and feeling sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think what or who you lick it from doesnt really matter its anal fucking blood
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha thanks i really need to get around to reading the catcher in the rye and i actually really enjoy going off on reddit like that its a safe space to express frustration about certain matters that would harm real world relationships
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in the tiger pit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what if my wall is made of soft but firm boobs and long legs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so weird i just masturbated to josh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,username checks out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a year old account too youve waited your whole reddit career for this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,metard youtard retard nation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was thinking not too far enough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess i prefer having more selfless romantics than soulless salespeople honestly most sales jobs should be done by a computer just to keep people from getting screwed by the sociopaths searching for a commission
UpliftingNews,not_removed,impress some people more most people i know dont care what you do just the salary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would disagree by not offering a reasonable sum then you dont get the best available sure we dont want them money driven but to have a livable income would make it a much more welcoming investment when we look at the foster system we can see the type of people attracted to the lowest dollar no one is getting rich from foster care instead it too often but not always attracts those at the bottom of the income levels who lack the necessary skills to deal with these situations which makes it ripe for abuse as the state cant drop these people fast enough because they dont have enough potential foster care facilities
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and teachers have shit pay for the responsibility they hold in their hands literally molding future society and no cell sales wont make you rich but it sure as shit will make more than a teacher ive known cell phones sales people and they made pretty damn good money compared to the benefits they provide to society
UpliftingNews,not_removed,their salaries might leave something to be desired but teacher pensions are fat im not sure i agree with them being underpaid for that reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,depends on the school district which certificationsprofessional development they complete etc at my school district all fulltime teachers earn the same base pay regardless of content area or gradelevel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually this whole thread has ended in pretty ironic fashion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my retarded waifu pillow i screen printed a still of corky wearing lipstick its pretty tits
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ya like ahpples
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes a good shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love me some bill burr
UpliftingNews,not_removed,modal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gotta say this sounds pretty aussie to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nothing they said wicked which is a boston thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wicked wicked wicked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im thinking ron weasley was originally scripted as a wizard from boston but jk rowling was too lazy to remove wicked from his dialogue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah mainer here we also say wicked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for me its australian more than anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive seen movies and so forth presumably in other parts of the country where wicked is just used as as an adjective not an adverb like it is in new england like with californian skateboarders its just that was wicked to me it sounds unfinished wicked what
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uhh im from nebraska and be used it thats wicked cool brah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,apparently a couple meaning more than is a new england thing too some how i picked up lots of mannerisms from the east coast even though i only lived there for a few years as a very young child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,born and raised in texas but i say wicked for some reason sometimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wicked is a whole new england thing now i picked that up but not the accent i think
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like rum is very old school my grandparents said it like that but my parents and i not so much if youre under and say it like that youre probably a wicked townie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so true im from the south and i stopped midsentence after dropping the rum pronunciation one day i had been fully indoctrinated at that point plenty of fucken kehds from then on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same pronunciation for roof too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,australian accent and a hardcore new england accent boston can sometimes sounds similar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most people expect to receive food at a wedding and food generally costs money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not everyone has a poverty wedding though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this works in the south but i married a yankee and they expect to be fed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,here i am just thinking of how to put a baby in her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bluuuuurrrreeedd liiiiiinneees hey hey hey
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because blurred lines are only for normal people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think she works at a private school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what are you even asking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you soak a baked potato in fermented potato and then fry it mmm that sounds wonderful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,double baked hhrng
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks ill have to check it out sometime i love movies about eating potatoes and feeling sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it licking blood or licking ass that bothers you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,👪 👫 👬 👭
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean would you prefer a sociopath take care of your six year old heh p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,depends on the state mine requires a masters degree for all teachers within a certain number of years after receiving teaching certification
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ohh mhyyy gahd jay look at that fackin baby wheel

UpliftingNews,not_removed,future reference or nah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,long wwwwwoooooooaaaaaaar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same here i say it most people use the word i wouldnt think somebody was from elsewhere if they said it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah this guy in my pledge class and my friends gf are both from like an area outside of lowell and they both say rum instead of room and both use wicked way too much haha oh yeah for reference theyre both
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be fair i didnt think i said it that way until the first day of freshman year four years ago when my ra thought i was talking about rum and tried to write me up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just mean use of the word wicked i got downvoted damn people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,family did a pot luck it was better than catered most people dont have extravagant weddings that strain finances exactly when they need more money to start a new life with their partner
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is such a dumb comment like ok you spent an exorbitant amount of money on your wedding good for you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why are teachers afraid of judges
UpliftingNews,not_removed,with a side of sweet potato fries with ketchup with fermented potato juice mixed with it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eating double baked potatoes while baked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well then this is the movie for you its also great but its hard to recommend to people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its probably licking the ass of a person whos bleeding from their anus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha ok so now we gotta find a job that will allow sociopaths a fulfilling career
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am so goddamn confused
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i got her nahmba how ya like them bahnahnahs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obviously not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wicked retahhded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just like the kids at the wedding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean america was a british thing at one point too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a wicked lotta people use the word but not as an adverb unless they are from new england
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now thats funny because i say package store or even packie all the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i up vote yo gudday mate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but someone your family was still paying for all that food and giving you their time spent preparing it not everyone has that as an option
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for the same reason anyone would be afraid of judges or police or mma boxers i thought the answer would be self evident if you followed it through to its logical conclusion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ceo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh no i have a latex allergie cant touch bananas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,weve gone meta
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope we use it as an adverb down here too dont worry yall arent the only ones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right back at you friend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how much do you think bulk pot luck costs hint it costs less than buying each of those people a mealonce in your life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a choice and thats all that matters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im afraid of you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was hoping for something a little lesspowerful we already have enough ceos that will fire people for a bump in the quarterlies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its so true we drop rs in some words that have them and then plug them into words that dont for years i thought it was spelledpronounced chicargo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,spider in the shower is that you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,made me cry i will now treat my sister better because i didnt know that some meany jokes would follow her in her future
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sometimes we need to show our little pals the appreciation they deserve
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love my dog but if he ever did that to a kid i would have him destroyed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,immediately that poor baby girl this shit made me cry and rethink getting a big dog because you never know even with the best trained animals theres always that what if
UpliftingNews,not_removed,um no there is no what if with welltrained dogs welltrained dogs do not attack people especially kids the article doesnt even mention the dogs breed dont put all dogs in one group because their one shitty neighbour didnt train their dog
UpliftingNews,not_removed,any size dog might nip snap or growl they cant talk but ive never had a dog that would do something like that best advice dont get a wolf or mix wonderful dogs but not for kids dont get a dog thats been bred to fight there are also a ton of resources online that can suggest what types of dogs are good for kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,um for sure buddy ill remember that and use that in life for the rest of my years 👍
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not sure if sarcasm but ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,girl who lost parents gets meal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats lovely i feel all warm inside now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,totes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is why i hate when people judge others for playing pokemongo this game has brought happiness and nostalgia to millions of people around the world no ones getting hurt no ones dying its all fun enjoy it while it lasts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read that as he stopped the mom from taking it and i was like why tho
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah thats what i got from that title jealous nine year old demands he remain only child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought i was the only one i had to read it a few more times to get it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean the article spells it out pretty quickly its just a poorly worded headline
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is this uplifting i dont normally comment when i remove a post but this is just ridiculous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is so sweet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,first give the palestinian people the keys to their homes back

UpliftingNews,not_removed,punch that tumor to death with man power
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this might not always work if the cell has receptors for testosterone it might cause the cells to grow even faster
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the human body is unimaginably complex treatments for one person will not always work for another especially if its a powerful disease such as cancer but its enlightening to see progress anyhow good job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,always remember to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well theyd better be now that theyre endangered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bees are so punny
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this program is all feels and not helpful a liberal arts associates degree is basically useless even the professor quoted in the story agrees students who earn a certified technical skill as part of their associates degree find a job more easily and earn more money what these ladies need is a useful skill not a useless degree
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as opposed to stem degrees because
UpliftingNews,not_removed,make sure to choose a worthless major and to pick a private school so you have maximum debt with minimal employable skills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you all do know that you can get a stem degree at a liberal arts institution right and that youre probably more hirable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,education is probably useful especially for single moms who need help crossing the poverty line an extra human capital boost can be what it takes to help them get a higher paying more stable job rather than working multiple lowpaying part time jobs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how would you be more hirable if you received a stem degree from a liberal arts vs a research university at best you are equally hirable im not saying its a huge disadvantage because at the end of the day a degree is a degree and more often than not its connection that get you a job however if im deciding on identical candidates and one is from a liberal arts college and the other is from research university i probably wouldnt go with the liberal arts candidate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most universities top tier research schools are liberal arts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im assuming youre a man based on your username lol glad to know you try to understand the perspective of women
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he could be from another planet it wouldnt make what he said less true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed freecodecampcom it takes a couple months of free time at home and doesnt cost anything i promise my company and a couple others just local to me accept that as entry level coding jobs which easily even as interns can usually pay more than a liberal arts degree will without a few years of specialized skills its about skills and practice so it can only take a few months to move up to someone who cares its even easier than most fields to get flexible hours or work from home if ur in need of caring for kids more than most work schedules allow options like that have real world immediate demand positions and can be done for free by anyone a little motivated an arts degree is what our customer service staff literally all have it pays over minimum wage and theyve been there for years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why not learn wellrounded life skills i dont see how theres anything wrong with liberal arts or why you feel justified in deciding how women should make money or have a family
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont see how theres anything wrong with liberal arts theres a shit ton of people with these degrees they do not teach indemand skills and tend not be overly useful why you feel justified in deciding how women should make money because one way is stupid and leaves them with more debt for no reason this is how we get into financial crises people take loans to buy things that arent worth what they paid for with money they can never pay back stop encouraging stupid decision making
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so the problem lies where what type of job a liberal arts degree will get you to me a liberal arts degree basically mens youre settling for a not so high paying jobmost dont go over that doesnt really mean much i mean dont get me wrong i support single moms going to college but why do i only hear people getting financial aid then using it for liberal arts its like people just choose it because its an easy major if you cant get a good job by going to college why go into college in the first place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,out of curiosity what do you see these women doing with their liberal arts degrees while i agree it helps to get women an education there are a tremendous number of liberal arts degree individuals competing in the market the art institute international was sued for promising students in each major could get employment following graduation that means in a tiny city like pittsburgh that near filed for bankruptcy in if a graduating photographers simultaneously were all going to get work not likely not even distributing photographers to various cities is likely in this field i cant help but feel colleges are targeting demographics like moms to take on majors that may take less work there simply is no proof theres a return on this degree being effective
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what exactly are you going to do with that name one job you can get with a liberal arts degree that you cant get without it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a liberal arts degree does not mean an art degree people with liberal arts degrees include scientists doctors mathematicians economists computer scientists engineers sociologists psychologists etc i dont think you know what liberal arts means if you assume that a good example of someone with a liberal arts degree is just a photographer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you shouldnt assume i think you took my example too literal and you are getting unnecessarily very defensive maybe you shouldnt post controversy if you cant take the heat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why more countries dont do this is beyond me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,isnt this this point of having a baby shower but wonderful idea for those in need should include some literature too on how to raise children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not every person has a family our group of friends they can rely on to throw a baby shower
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also the box is a crib for families who cannot afford one nicola our first minister has been looking into this for a while a few years and im actually loving the support shes giving all women in scotland she even had university and high school students take part in a design of the box its super supportive and a free alternative that everyone gets when theyre pregnant no matter what they earn whats the problem here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,goddamnit i won the lottery but im
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so why buy the ticket stop paying for it if u dont want to win
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im too old for this arent we all grandma arent we all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the fuck she mean
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the habbadacter relief fund is accepting charitable donations
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as alanis morrisette wrongly used in her song isnt it ironic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just like trump shouldnt play the game if winning isnt really helpful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the first thing i wondered i dont spend on half a roll of scratch offs because i didnt want the anymore i was hoping to win much more than i just paid what the hell is she doing buying lottery tickets if she doesnt want to win the money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,never has there been a more apt time to quote alanis morrisette
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you think about it that song is actually extremely ironic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep its like rayheeaiin on your weddin day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a story of an canadian woman and we still have to compare it to trump somehow just let it go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my thoughts exactly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i bet all her children grandchildren great grand children long lost relatives start to visit her now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,let it go let it go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no visitors except on party business
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant hold it in anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,arrest this cutie he may cause harm to those allergic to adorableness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aww what a nice guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i also enjoyed the fact that the police officer didnt want any publicity from this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a feelgood story we get a lot of diapers stolen from my store im a bit disillusioned though a lot of the people we see on camera stealing them have plenty of money for booze and cigarettes we have cameras all over the liquor department and have the tobacco behind a staffed counter the diapers however are in an aisle with only one camera watching it some people are struggling and need a good break other people steal diapers because they cant steal booze and dont have enough cash for both
UpliftingNews,not_removed,raising arizona anyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awful website
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the walmart in my town is literally the most stolen from one in the state the items that are stolen the most diapers and baby formula
UpliftingNews,not_removed,diapers can be very expensive and many lower income folks dont have the resources to wash cloth diapers many areas have diaper bank charities since food stampswic etc will not pay for diapers if you know anyone in this situation look into a diaper bank for your region lets keep those babies healthy with clean diapers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hope they dont consider having a third children poor kids good thing they ran into a policeman with a heart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the officer declined to be identified this is how it is done kids without the necessity for social gratification
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while working at a walgreens i once observed a customer powerwalk out of the store with two large packages of diapers one under each arm we called for him to stop and he gave no fucks about us and kept walking when he left the parking lot i went to chase him but my supervisor said not to once theyre off the property we cant do anything about it i was livid over that experience for awhile how dare this brazen fucker just openly grab stuff and walk away not even turning back to look when we called for him to stop the temerity of it just irritated the shit out of me but then i stopped to think about what he was stealing diapers something you need for babies i got stuck on that for awhile how fucked up is it that a parent feels they need to steal diapers just to keep their kid wrapped up felt bad for being angry about it because honestly if youre stealing fucking diapers you probably need them more than i do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man i dont get to say this enough so im gonna relish it good guy cop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,too bad nobody paid for birth control
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the sad part is that the parents in question probably have ipads and iphones but think that they must steal to provide for their children kudos to the officer for using his brain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i work in a popular retail store it seems that people steal diapers because theyre an item that people would shy away from confronting due to the possibility of there being a child in need however some of these thieves take these diapers and turn around to do a no receipt return diapers are expensive people steal them so they can return them for moneybut what this officer did was amazing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,still a bad day example for the older kid to learn to steal from the parent i feel bad for the parents and i dont claim to know their situationbut i dont see it as all that uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while lovely that the office helped them doesnt really solve the issue of having children they cant afford feel bad for the children being raised in poverty is painful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i could use a new camera maybe ill stop by this target
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you cant afford kids dont have them its bad enough thst other tax payers have to subsidise parents already without encouraging theft
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you cant afford diapers you shouldnt be allowed to have a kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,til its ok to steal things you think are overpriced
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably pretty common items to be stolen my local grocer has cameras and monitors all over the baby supplies isle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as much as id like to go hug this officer i think that its very modest of him not to identify himself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have known crackheads that steal diapers and trade them for drugs its a pretty standard hustle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but thats not going to solve anything itll just teach the lesson that stealing is ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,use cloth instead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they couldnt afford the diapers and shoes because the mother sold her food stamps and wic card for crack good job enabling these people bleeding heart cops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is this uplifting news its just show what a horrible state the us is in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,diapers are very expensive and often a target of shoplifting they can sell very well on the streets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aww im so warm and fuzzy thinking about the irresponsible parents who cant even afford diapers for their kids and steal to get by how heartwarming lets encourage this behavior by exempting them from the laws we all have to follow and bail them out for their poor decision making skilla
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stealing the diapers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lots of them does that mean i should condone theft
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they shoplift again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you need to steal diapers you shouldnt be having kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,odds says all involved were white
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok guys heres the thing the cop who paid for the stuff is undoubtedly a great philanthropisthe saw people in need fulfilled their need without expecting anything in return good but i think what everyones ignoring here is that the couple did something illegal and notably not just culturally abnormal but something that in every culture is wrong they stole thingsyes to clothe and keep their children in diapers but they still stole things they broke the law now i know in our culture of its not illegal to be illegal and i dont mind people crossing the border illegally as long as they dont break the law we dont see rule of law as being applicable equally to everyone but think about that we as a culture have dispensed with equal protection under the law a constitutionally guaranteed right and have instead perpetuated this system of piecemeal application and enforcement of law to situations based on the race gender identity socioeconomic position which is the main determining factor of the outcome in this case sexual orientation religious and political leanings of those involved does this seem right to you more importantly and more relevantly does this seem constitutional to you why be rewarded for breaking the law in what universe does that make any sense or do anything but guarantee that people will continue to steal knowing that if they appear in need they will not face consequences for making the wrong decision instead of seeking the help that undoubtedly exists in this country just my cents bring on the haters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we should question why a diaper costs so much in addition to calling the parents bad parents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shoplifting diapers what is this raising arizona
UpliftingNews,not_removed,diapers and laundry detergent are among the items most often stolen from stores in the usa if youve ever seen diapers or laundry detergent under lock and key or w those alarm devices attached to them now you know pretty sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,buy em cloth diapers yeah you have to wash them they still work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminds me of the sublime song about the la riots some kids went in the store with their mother i saw her when she came out she was gettin some pampers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he declined to be identified too the hero we dont deserve
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one of the detail cops at my supermarket recently did something like this i was working selfscan when a womens carriage locked up as she was leaving this only happens if you dont go through a register i went over and asked for her receipt as im required to do she began to panic and tried to push the carriage past me the cop noticed and walked over and dealt with it from there it turns out she was homeless and he dealt with her on the streets a few time and he said she was always easy to deal with all she had was a loaf of bread cheese packaged deli meat a premade sub from the deli a soda and some sour patch kids the cop bought everything but the sour patch kids for her and let her off with a warning
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cops are like all people too some are great some are not most are somewhere in between
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ah good idea next time i burgle i will hide the loot in me pants and keep the diapers nearby
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol nice propaganda
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if they cant afford diapers then why the fuck did they have a baby
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ahhh good people still exist and true hero dont need recognise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hmm as charitable as it seems often the family who were stealing for necessities had spent their money on other things like booze and drugs i always have that in my mind about those people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hmm as charitable as it seems often the family who were stealing for necessities had spent their money on other things like booze and drugs i always have that in my mind about those people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those kids will grow up to be thieves just like mommy and daddy taught them when they were young they used their kids to shoplift they had their kids commit crimes for them in the article it says they put new shoes on a kids foot to wear out which is theft yet instead of arresting them and letting cps figure out how to find these kids a better environment barney fife here decided to reinforce the idea that taking stuff from a store is perfectly acceptable i get it really the cop wanted to be a good dude and not break up the family etc etc but lets not pretend thats what was best for these kids if the parents cant afford the basics like clothes and diapers its probably not the best environment for a kid to grow up in short term this is uplifting but looking to the future its sad to think about how those kids are most likely gonna turn out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,since when having kids you cant support is in any way an excuse to commin crime well i stabbed this old lady to steal her money you monster but i did that to buy diapers ah okey then poor guy why do people think its uplifting what is going on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these people shouldnt have kids if you cant afford diapers this isnt uplifting news its shitty adults raising children these kids are probably fucked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this scenario can go both ways i just gotta say youre very optimistic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,too bad this isnt all over cnn or any major new channel because the public rather learn about bad cops highest respect to that officer a true spirit of protect and serve
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like how the officer responded but come on guys if you cant afford a kid dont have a kid having a kid and afterwards falling on hard times is understandable having a second kid while in the midst of hard times like these people is not a plan b pill is a hell of a lot cheaper than a kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unfortunately raising children is not an right if youre dealing diapers i have to wonder if youre competent to be raising children at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man this is a feel good story but dont fucking have kids if you cannot afford it for fuck sake
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love that its really sweet of the officer to do thatbut then again these people are probably gonna try to steal again but this time from fred meyer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know how else you get necessities for your children by not being a lazy sack of dog shit and getting a fucking job oh you do and still cant afford your kids then why the fuck did you have them oh mistakes happen not when it comes to having fucking children wear a condom pull out be on birth control absolutely zero sympathy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice story but one thing that bugs me why are people getting kids when they clearly cant afford it it seems stupid as all hell and theyre not doing their kids or society any favors if you cant even take care of yourself adding another persons life into that equation is straight up stupid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this makes me think of how often times the only thing behind a locked case in the grocery store is baby food and formula which i guess implies it must be one of the most stolen items i cannot imagine how awful it must feel to have to choose between risking arrest or letting your baby go hungry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry but this is still stealing and its still a crime even if it is something you need and youre down on your luck i need a certain medication for a medical condition and i cant afford the it would cost me does that mean i can steal it no
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he should have arrested them and the eight year old
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that website is total shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love the cops and glad they helped the kids still ridiculous that the parents couldnt or could barely afford the first child and now have a month old huge problem in this country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as great as this is how many other parents were prosecuted and punished under the law for doing this same thing now they hear this story of one cop letting these folks go how would that make you feel to be the unlucky one didnt i see not to long ago a post about a cop that would let a kid go who had a joint but would no longer be able to with a body camera because of liability and the threat of lawsuits now with a camera he would have to charge everyone or risk losing his job regardless of the implications here its unfair for the people who have children and pay for all the necessities out of their own pockets through hard honest work when others can break the law and end up better for it afterwords no reprocussions free diapers and shoes and a cop that gets all the attention
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol nice propaganda
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh yeah lick the jackbooted thugs feet literally what i am told every time when i say something nice about cops on reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fake and gay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cops a great guy hard times when people have to do this they shouldnt have to in the greatest country on earth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,birth control is cheaper than diapers this couple obviously failed twice in understanding how a condom works if ya cant afford kids dont breed them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i saw a woman with a baby stroller getting arrested outside of a kohls once it was sad the end
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i swear this sub posts the dumbest content as uplifting cops let these two go free and thats uplifting come on just rename this sub to sjw fodder already
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was a routing shoplifting bust until the cops noticed they were stealing diapers and decided they needed a good beating ftfy your friends at rjusticeporn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eminem couldnt afford to buy his daughter diapers at one time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its nice but just goes to show you how people who really should not be having kids are having kids there is seriously an endemic problem if kids having kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe you shouldnt have fucking kids if you cant even afford the basic necessities need does not excuse crime
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this made me teary little glimmers of humanity still exist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,diapers are also used to make certain illegal drugs during disaster relief after hurricane katrina we were told to only give out a certain amount of diapers so as to not encourage drug dealers to come to relief sites
UpliftingNews,not_removed,redmond pd being all awesome again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they the sold the in facebook with the baby formula
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does he not realize they steal diapers solely because the hood is full of babies and turnaround is very quick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hats off to our officers that can recognize need and realize when a simple act of kindness will make a much more profound impact than an arrest or charge
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ponder thisi have always wondered how certain persons and groups will invest so much time money and advertising on right to life and no abortion yet turn their judgmental back on the babies and children born cry and scream when they witness or hear a story of an abused child or one living in poverty take that energy and donate kids clothes to homeless shelters churches and childrens services organizations or ers where nurses could see that they go to family in need donate childcare items such as diapers and needs offer to help a local family in need build up your own community so these kids and families have resources once they are born and not aborted give a young mom a gift of being a mentor dont get hypocritical when sex education and birth control methods are introduced challenge your belief system and do something positive instead of sending money to prolife groups send a motherbaby care package to your local labor and delivery unit for the mom who kept her baby against the odds donate school supplies diapers food and clothes stop preaching stop bitching and step up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they said it was for the black man they said it was for the mexican and not for the white man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,should have shoplifted condoms first
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a real hero yay and we dont know who he is just like in the comic books how cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay heres my problem with all this if you dont have money for diapers dont have fucking kids although props to the cop for being a good guy but srsly if you cant afford kids dont have em
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a great guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whoa im from yakima small world today on reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,forced popup covering of my mobile screen well guess im not reading that story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if tampons are given out for free then so should diapers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good thing his wishes were respected
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats the definition of charity to give and recieve no acknowledgement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but i wish he would when the cops do something horrible its all over the place its nice when we hear about a good guy cop they should get some publicity too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no self respecting law enforcement officer wants to be known for anything they have done
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well yeah now everyone is going to want free diapers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id say hes a very humble man we need more like him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably because his friends would give him shit or there would be repercussions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not a donald trump fan but it does remind me of all the random acts of kindness he does without telling the news or anyone else i do think he knows the word will get out there though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agree but the fact that this officer thought these guys deserved a break tells me they arent the kind to buy booze before basics for their kids cops are some of the most disillusioned people out there becuase they have to see this reality on a daily basis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be honest though even if a parent is a scumbag who spends the money they need for their kids on stupid shit it doesnt make the kids need diapers or food less its never the kids fault that they were born to a piece of shit who cant care for them so even if some dickhead absconds with some huggies while paying for a handle of jack daniels the stolen goods are still making some extremely unfortunate kids life just a tiny bit better shitbag parents are one of societys greatest ills that has no perfect cure but as an adult who grew up as the offspring of a mother that thought booze and cigs were more important than keeping me fed or clean i just cant get mad about laws thatre broken which will ultimately help an unfortunate child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i used to do lp at a ross and there are two types of people who steal because its easier than working people would come in groups to steal once grandmothers came with kids who were stuffing things into their pants and had us all chasing them none of them actually left the store with anything and they told the police they were just messing with us the next day reviewing the cameras we realizied that the grandmothers left with over worth of stuff while everyone was dealing with the kids ages they are in depserate situations and they cant figure out another way to get what they need another guy who was in a wheelchair used to come in and steal a single sock at a time because he was too ashamed to steal a whole pair he got a month in disability and had just enough money to rent an efficiency we never stopped him for taking anything but once we told him just to go take the whole package of socks and he nearly started crying left without the socks and never came back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am a former walmart ap and i kid you not of the time infant food or diapers are stolen theyre simply selling them on the black market i am not making this up guys literally go around the hood selling stolen diapers and infant meal i once tackled yes i was technically not allowed to do that a guy running out the store in parachute pants with dollars of infant formula and when the police searched his car he had well over grand of baby formula from every food max walmart safeway and luckys in the california bay area police actually had a bolo hand delivered to us for this guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think diapers are an expensive item that can be easily sold so thats why they are stolen same with tide drug dealers will pay for shipments with a truckload of tide because its legal and easy to launder sorry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well alcoholism is a disease but so are people so im torn on how to feel about this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this wouldnt bother me except i see so many people steal diapers to return same with formula they return for full value and its rarely questioned
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when you notice them stealnig do you take actoin and go to stop them or is it for some other purpose
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plus theyre probably just going to take them to another store and return them for cash to buy more booze
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i see this shit all the timepeople will make a scene about why a restaurant wont accept food stamps for food and that its the same as cash but better because its free government money all while reeking of weed and cigarettes holding a large starbucks drinkwearing some extra fresh version of the latest jordansand their kids of course will look like they havent showered in a week and wearing tshirts with holes in themhalf the time they drive a car nicer than i doi bet they get housing assistance too these people could be one month away from being the people who steal diapersand i dont feel one bit sorry for them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a feelgood story you came to the wrong subreddit if you cant deal with it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a lot of drug dealers will take diapers and formula as payment either for their own kids or to take back for refunds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly what i was going to say most likely stealing them to sell thats a big on the street item i know because when i was working some people tried to steal some late at night one time and from years of stories ive seen online
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your last line sums up my thoughts perfectly of thieves who get busted are the ones who screwed up in getting their priorities straight and deserve no sympathy regardless of whether the items were necessary a crime was still being committed and they need to be punished in some form i came from a family of entrepreneurs and if someone stole from my store you can absolutely bet id want them punished to the fullest extent possible for threatening my livelihood cant feed your kids because you spent it on booze or drugs not my problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,son you got a panty on your head
UpliftingNews,not_removed,first thing i thought of ill take the huggies and all the cash in the drawer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what does this have to do with arizona
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you enjoy their free content well did you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its yakima cut em some slack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the website is a lot like the city i live there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awful newspaper seriously this is my hometowns newspaper and its a fucking joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess i missed somethingbut im too scared to go back again and check
UpliftingNews,not_removed,makes me sad whenever i have to look at my hometown newspaper online
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its the yakima herald were just learning to use the interwebs here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep from what ive been told at my local walmart its diapers formula and condoms if only condoms were the shoplifted item
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are expensive and very easily resold also frequently stashed in baby strollers as they think people will not stop them if use their kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we had a lady walk in with a screaming baby one time rinsed us not walmart but another wal store if you catch my drift we came up missing a pack of diapers multiple bottles of formula and a bunch of baby stuff like pacifiers and toys it was awful we were understaffed one day and nobody suspected her until we checked the tapes i honestly have no sympathy for these people yeah your kid needs these things but jesus christ dont just rob us blind because you couldnt plan ahead so annoying i always hate seeing stories like this too dont encourage that behavior
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if only nature had some sort of already provided way for a mother to produce milk for her children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i used to be a reporter and did many stories to promote local food pantries one thing they always needed in terms of donations was diapers we have a great community with many generous people but sometimes you dont think to donate anything beyond food ive never heard of a diaper bank before but that is a great idea and yeah i get it if you cant afford children dont have them but once people are in that situation what they and their kids really need is help
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive got boxes of various size and brands of diapers because of my sons picky skin or outgrowing them someone please tell me how to find one of these donation places im so broke im wiping my kids ass with wet wash rags i know what its like to not be able to afford diapers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when my daughter got a chance at running through a store for three minutes to grab a shopping cart full of stuff for free promotional event one of the things she tossed into the cart was diapers and shed planned ahead on what to get
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are a lot of basic necessities like diapers laundry detergent personal hygiene items and toilet paper that arent covered by food stamps and arent usually available at food pantries my church started a personal needs closet for this and theres always a line when it opens really sad that people have to struggle for these often over looked necessities
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they charge sales tax on them too very lame
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yet food stamps cover monster
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what resources are required to wash a diaper
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i typically always participate in local canned food drives and purchase pre filled bags at the grocery store for families in need i wonder why there are never any diaper drives going on around my parts i could get on board with that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because its harder to get diapers than a child maybe people should be a tiny bit more careful ill be donating condoms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i deposit a full diaper in the diaper bank does it gain more interest than a fresh diaper do depends gain more interest since they are more sizeable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,resources to wash cloth diapers you make it sound like it takes a lot when changing a diaper hold a clean corner dunk in toilet flush open lid of container with chlorinated water drop diaper in with the rest close lid when you have enough for a load empty out water and put in washing machine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or dont have them if you cant afford them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,assuming they actually planned the first or got a choice in the matter which isnt always the case
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the third ones gonna be chinese
UpliftingNews,not_removed,never attempt to chase a shoplifter at a store you work at the best case scenario is that nothing comes of it the worst case scenario could leave you injured out of a job or even dead i worked for a national big box store for a good while and in my time at the job there were at least two situations in the company where a shoplifter hit a pursuing employee with their car in both situations the injured employees were terminated almost immediately and received no financial assistance for the injuries since there is a strict policy to just let them go there have also been many instances throughout the industry where an employee was killed for chasing them chasing the thief is an extreme liability for the company and is one of the first things employees are told to never attempt under any circumstances think about it like this is it really worth it to risk your life and limb to try and defend the money of a soulless corporation that would never the same for you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its called compassion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the diapers were being stolen by dennis hopper in blue velvet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im glad some one said it condoms are actually pretty easy to obtain for free and depending on your state you can probably get birth control for free too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if they are stealing diapers food and shoes they dont need punishment they need immediate help and direction to an agency for help in the near future the policeman did the right thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so youve personally donated diapers to people in need like this cop has try doing this first before you start complaining about the government not doing it for you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good odds ill take €
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no hate here well said
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is this way because of how the laws are constructed many people fall under laws they dont respect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have some compassion thats the only thing that keeps us human if you cant differentiate between people stealing for basic needs and ordinary thief then youre fucked in the head in an ideal world those needs would be subsidised by the government but we dont live in an ideal world after all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rather than calling them bad parents though they were teaching their to steal so it is possible theyre not great people maybe what could be looked at is why people who clearly cannot afford children are having them societal pressure lack of access to birth control or abortions lack of awareness of how much it can affect them financially i am always mystified by people having kids they cannot afford and i would really like to know what makes people do it also who knows how much they have stolen previously how many pairs of shoes has that kid walked out in so diapers cost a lot so what if a family cannot afford to take on another child that isnt a justification for theft theyre making bad decisions and passing that kind of decisionmaking on to their kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well some people dont agree with plan b or any kind of abortion and whether you agree or disagree with that stance you have no right to tell anyone otherwise also you can stand on that pedestal of great decisions and judge these people and their situation all you want but at the end of the day we cant change the past so anyone in a similar situation should look at advice in this thread about assistance and local resources designed to help a family in a tight spot you have no basis to determine what their situation is or how they came to feeling the need to steal necessities for their kids maybe the parents lost their jobs maybe theyre just lazy neither one of us actually knows so theres no need to make assumptions and decide the parents are inherently shitty people you dont know what their lives were like when they decided to have that child so lets not judge so hard edit judge is apparently a poor word choice my point is that we should not make assumptions every time we see a story like this not every bad decision is made by bad people and not every crime is committed by people who have previously put themselves in bad positions there are other circumstances in life that can change or cornfields beyond our control and not everyone knows what to do when that happens desperation can be a bitch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont know why youre getting down voted you can literally get condoms for free at county health clinics at least in my state i imagine its a similar situation around the country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i completely agree with you i hate that you cant say that without people getting all worked up over it its absolutely irresponsible to have a kid that you cant provide for at all times in my opinion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what country do you live in where people dont have the right to determine their own fertility china
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so you believe that nobody has ever lost their job after they had kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i got pregnant while on birth control shit happens
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree with the sentiment but i mean really whats the use of pointing this out now people mess up and as someone who is passionately prochoice that means a woman has the choice to keep a pregnancy regardless of if they think they can afford it whose to say what the cut off is i wouldnt dream of considering a child until i have at least in the bank whereas this might seem crazy to others my sympathy lies with the kids in this situation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,amen one persons individual actions to alleviate suffering should be applauded but never mistake that sort of action as sufficient or even particularly important individual acts of decency performed instead of taking the action we need for social justice is somewhere between moral masturbation and collaboration with the exploitive classes also worth noting that after performing this single act of kindness the paramilitary internal security trooper returned to his regular job as part of the manpower that maintains an evil system of economic exploitation and social control for his sake and ours we should hope that his one act of kindness is reflective of a broader moral awakening and the man mentioned in the story will soon repent of his choice to work committing violence in the service of a vile corrupt system
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so in your mind protection never fails people arent allowed to be against having abortions and nobody loses their job after they have a baby interesting how black and white your thought process is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unfortunately the world isnt perfect and mistakes albeit beautiful blessings of mistakes happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh yeah being so poor you have to steal diapers and got away with it once is totally better than having a job and being able to pay for them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,depending on your insurance birth control can still be way too expensive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people like you never seem to have enough imagination to get that things may have been good when they had their children many people in dire financial straights werent always in that position catastrophic things can happen after children are born to put them in that position
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i got pregnant while on the pill shit happens dont be a dick about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow what a unique statement that no one has ever said on the internet before just as soon as those time machines come around im sure this couple will pop right back and retroactively make the decisions you think they should
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously dont poor people understand procreation is a privilege for the well off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont feel sad ages ago i worked in a dept store in the loss prevention department apparently some people used the stroller as a way to conceal shoplifting the kid may not even be theirs or it may be draped but empty you can stuff a lot of crap in a stroller
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the mere fact that you have a child does not mean shoplifting becomes an excusable offense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what i dont understand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,problem here is these kids exist here and now your comment doesnt compute
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you do realise people can lose money right and that sort of thing can happen after they have children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sometime people unexpected lose their jobs and cant find another one for a few months do you have more than months of saving if you do great but the majority of people dont how about unexpected medical expenses dad of the family is the bread winner has a stroke and cant work sometimes people have kids and are financially stable then shit happens
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are dozens of us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,babies are a choice or a direct result of our decision making generally speaking having a vagina which bleeds every month is not therefore diapers should definitely not be given out for free
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who the fucks giving out tampons for free
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and the definition of integrity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one of the highest forms of charity according to maimonides the only forms higher is if one gives anonymously and doesnt know who it goes to and granting someone self sufficiency
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he did it on purpose because he doesnt want people in his business and he wanted other people to realize it could be any cop doing things like this i think its a good thing and certainly what i would have done if i was in his position edit syntax
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because the media are nothing more than vultures and only want bad news theyd rather report something stupid and trivial than uplifting news depending on the news station or whoever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well cops are supposed to be good thats kind of the point when they intentionally do something shitty it should be blasted everywhere i expect cops to save children every day that means nothing to me but uf a cop rapes a child and serves no punishment for it you better believe i want to hear about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not just cops we always point out the negative and ignore the positive jimmy is an awful person because he cheated on his wife but we will ignore the fact he volunteers every saturday at the soup kitchen he is a terrible person to his wife yes but overall he is a good person with a big heart all too often we focus on negatives and ignore positives not saying all negatives have a positive counterpart like this just making a point with a fictitious example
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah you never hear about the making the look good anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,true but often for a very different reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be fair he has the diapers to deal with the shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plus targets security is wellknown and rightly feared amongst routine shoplifters the only people who shoplift from target are high or have no idea what theyre doing because theyve never done it before these were probably good people at a real bad time in their life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,true story i used to work with a gentleman who was a cop in atlanta for years he left the force because he could no longer deal with the emotional baggage that came with the job he had so many stories of breaking up families having children taken away from parents both deserved and others due to financial reasons similar to this event drug overdoses and the like a lot of things that can be hard to digest he and his wife had just found out they were expecting and he didnt want to bring that emotional stress home with a new baby in the house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wouldnt it be more helpful to their well being if the parents are thrown in jail for prolonged periods of time and have to prove the financial and mental capacity to care for offspring before regaining custody
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no but thats why they were directed towards some helpful resources and while its totally fine for you or anyone else to not be upset by theft like this its just as understandable more probably for target to not want theft in their stores
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he got a month in disability and had just enough money to rent an efficiency so sad people bitch about people living off the system yet rarely understand its just barely enough for the bare minimum if youre not cheating the system poor guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also tide
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what is a bolo hand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,police actually had a bolo hand delivered to us for this guy i was like what the hell is a bolo hand so i googled it found httpsenwikipediaorgwikiboloknife and i thought so is a bolo hand the same as a bolo knife it doesnt make a lot of sense for the police to be sending them a knife then httpwwwyouareanidiotorg not you me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,idk why i read this in hank hills voice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and whatever cash ya got
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a movie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i couldnt see an x anywhere on mobile newspapers are ridiculous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i closed the page because it was so aweful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,something can be free and terrible its the same reason i dont call your mom back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not even uisng noscript used to but it had serious performance drawbacks might be fixed now though need to check only ublock and httpsiimgurcomlbtsufnpng
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the palm springs of washington
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awfully written article you should hire some local eighth graders and put them out of business
UpliftingNews,not_removed,weird i dont think ive heard of a local news paper having its own website esp one that isnt from the
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh geeze did you report this to anyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sucks time to start befriending cashiers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill sink with you if you cant afford a child stop fucking rutting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if it worked of the time for everyone without problems yes then id agree
UpliftingNews,not_removed,minimum wage jobs usually dont make time to pump or provide good places for it despite being legally required to do so in right to work states you can be fired for anything as long as they dont say it was about making accommodations for nursinghealthother protected class statistically most working women are able to pump for a few weeks at most after returning to work after that its formula
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some babies just wont breastfees my own baby only breast fed for six weeks after that it was impossible to feed her my so was losing her mind over it and still feels guilty to this day that we are bottle feeding our baby its not always as cut and dry as you think and its hard for mothers that have tried their hardest and had to move on the the bottle to hear this kind of thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and yeah i get it if you cant afford children dont have them but once people are in that situation what they and their kids really need is help not to say you feel this way but to branch off i see bumper stickers and memes everywhere if you cant feed em dont breed em and it physically hurts my heart when we were going through fertility treatments to have our son our life was much much different we did not start off in the circumstances we are in now we have lost an income had our family struck three times now by cancer etc after my son was born a lot of things happened at once it all seemed to blow up suddenly i never thought we would be struggling to make minimum payments or keep food on our table or diapers on my sons butt tragedy and hardship can hit anyone at any time nobody is immune harsh generalizations and callous attitudes do infinitely more harm than good that being said these people got very lucky and i hope theyve since used the appropriate resources provided to them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive been associated with a local diaper bank the main point they try to get across is not to punish the infant for the parents actions diaper rashes infections stress in the home all caused by limited access to diapers its about aspect of starting a childs life in the right place many people usually of a particular political persuasion want to make it about the choices the parents made but how on earth is that fair to the child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i went to pick up my newborn from the nicu shes doing fantastic i saw a couple come to the nicu entrance and ask for more diapers and formula they had been discharged apparently a while back probably with a big stack of diapers and formula but seemed to have run out the nicu didnt give them any and i cant blame them i felt really bad for that couple
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ours does not distribute directly but works through food pantries good luck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,went to my local grocery one lucky day to find that they had marked down a couple brands of diapers because they were phasing out that designpackaging style i bought all the ones they had in my sons size and paid a little more than i ususally did on generic diapers for month and got months of brand name diapers my husband did not understand my sheer excitement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,worst toys r us ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what kind of store was it ideally she shouldve just gone for as many of the highest price item should could get say they sell phones just take like phones sell em later
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well a washer and dryer in your house is definitely necessary most apartments dont provide those
UpliftingNews,not_removed,frequent access to washing machines somewhere to keep a bucket of used nappies the kids wont get to room to dry them if they dont tumble dry i was slightly interested in cloth nappies but living in super cramped emergency accommodation with shared rotaed washing machines meant it would have been incredibly difficult and laundrettes arent always closeaffordable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,washer and dryer most laundromats do not allow diapers to be washed in their equipment for obvious reasons
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not just the resources but the sheer quantity of diapers that can be gone through when my kids were in the cloth diaper stage we were going through or so a day two days of that and were out being able to toss them in the wash nightly was what made it possible if you have to go to a laundromat frequently cloth is not so good
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think the local laundromat would take too kindly to people washing diapers there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol the resources they mentioned are washing machines
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or got a choice in the matter which isnt always the case huh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most children are planned if you are fertile have sex dont use birth control wontcant have an abortion and wontcant put any children that still result up for adoption then you plan on having children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can you care to elaborate i dont see the link between chinese diapers and poverty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i worked in retail i saw people steal sht all day longim jaded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im willing to donate condoms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do i have to do it personally its a drop in the ocean no real problem is fixed i have probably donated more diapers food and shelter through the government denmark that we have elected and paid taxes through than this cop has although i do applaud him for doing so what i am saying is its horrible people have to depend on the random acts of kindness instead of having a system where this problem isnt even in the first place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pounds gtfo with your pounds this is the united snakes of amnesia we dont do pounds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no stealing is stealing you can bring then charity diapers later pay for their child because at this rate its just a question of time but stealing is not ok it just isnt and shouldnt be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe they could afford them before they were born but circumstances have since changed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not everyone has a choice in giving birth plenty of states make it basically impossible for poor people to access abortion one or two places in a state hour waiting periods etc and birth control fails all the time plus financial situations change constantly people lose their jobs or are hit with huge medical bills theres pretty much always extenuating circumstances my mom was raising kids on a single salary when she got pregnant with me she didnt have access to an abortion and was trapped in an abusive relationship where even if she was able to get an abortion she wouldnt have been allowed to you dont know the circumstances maybe try some compassion instead of judgement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well some people dont agree with plan b or any kind of abortion and whether you agree or disagree with that stance you have no right to tell anyone otherwise dont agree with abortion but stealing is aokay then put your kid up for adoption if you cant afford a kid you cant have a kid just because they fucked up doesnt mean they can steal theft is theft stop trying to justify it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everyone deserves to be judged being judged is how one forms integrity and character
UpliftingNews,not_removed,too many americans live paycheck to paycheck cost of everyday living going up paycheck or hourly rate increase is a joke if you do get one ceos salary grossly increase
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its amazing how you ended up at that conclusion based on what i wrote you must be a clever individual but no thats of course not whats in my mind interesting how primal and lowintellect your thought process is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i definitely get that mistakes happen condoms break and ppills will be forgotten on occasion but according to so much research many of these mistakes could easily be avoided by just giving people propper sex education
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more expensive than the thousands of dollars a kid costs each year genuinely asking am canadian i have never paid for birth control mine is insured
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude thats not the point you shouldnt have a kid if you dont have the resources to support it procreation isnt a privilege anyone can procreate but you need to realize that a kid is a real fucking human being and if you bring that kid into the world willingly and knowing that you cant support it youre a trashcan of a person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the kid may not even be theirs so basically they shoplifted the baby too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my mother worked at a wallpaper store back in the and she saw this first hand some lady came into her store pushing an empty stroller and left with a stroller full of wallpaper my mom called the cops after she realized what happened and provided a description of the lady and her car i just want to know what kind of person steals wallpaper why anyone would want to steal wallpaper still confuses me to this day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats how a couple i know were able to get their kid food by hiding it in the stroller
UpliftingNews,not_removed,me too i figure ill be downvoted due to not sharing in the warmth of the pardon and i get that aspect but the bottom line is these parents resorted to criminal activity and then got away with it whos to say they wont continue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in terms of doing whats right for the baby its not their choice to be born into a shitty family but we can help with basic needs such as this for the health of the baby because the baby should not have to suffer because of idiotic parents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in new york a law was passed recently stating this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes batman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its called pr but i like the way you describe it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because the media audience are nothing more than vultures and only want bad news theyd rather report read something stupid and trivial than uplifting news there is a good debate to be had about how much of this is the responsibility of the media its easy to say that they should be out there educating people but the problem is thats a good way for them to go out of business in a clickdriven marketplace there are many good journalists and publications who struggle to make ends meet without including the type of things that many people complain about because thats what sells papersgenerates clickswhatever there are very rational justifications for blaming both the media and the consumer so i think its pretty unfair to say that the media are nothing more than vultures and only want bad news if you actually think about it thats a pretty horrible thing to say about someone whose job is to report the news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a time and a place for that discussion and its not here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,didnt you read he gave them away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait why is their security well known and rightly feared
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn i will make sure if i decide to shoplift i will avoid target
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know alcoholics and drug addicts cab also be good people with shitty lives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can confirm was arrested for shop lifting at a target was also high on lsd shhhhh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can confirm guy tried to melt off the hooks on locked devices to steal got caught twice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can confirm a couple years back they had someone following me around the store for like minutes i had been fidgeting with a box of something earlier opened up the top of a product and look at the item type deal they thought i was trying to steal shit pretty sure i ended up getting pissed and leaving the store without purchasing anything even though i had some things in my cart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,depends on where they would go when separated from the parents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have the sinking feeling that youre serious you actually think throwing someone in prison is an educational experience not a traumatic one where a person will learn lots of good life skills and address their bad habits wow following your suggestion is exactly how you would doom an entire class of society to generations of continued failure especially if you ensure the level of education for children stays horrible by basing school funding on property taxes eg people living in cheap houses in crappy neighborhoods get the worst schools in other words give them a poor education make them pay tons of police fines and then lock them up when they develop alcoholism and steal diapers for their kids to ensure the cycle continues
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish there would be more people that think like you upvoted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so other people should pay for the kid because their parents are too shitty to yes believe it or not but humans are a social creature and we operate through mutual contributions this means that even if you are a completely selfcentered anti social misanthropist its not difficult to see the logic that if your neighbors are doing well it will benefit yourself either through living in a better neighborhood or benefiting from the fruits of their work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is your problem though and youre already paying for these kids and will continue to do so despite your tough guy pronouncements welcome to the real world kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its really fucked up an old supervisor of mine has kids with different fathers and doesnt know who the last fathers are meanwhile she lives with him in his house that section is paying for he owns a business and she does pretty good herself the one time i needed unemployment i got denied because i was in school which i had started months before while working meanwhile of my classmates had unemployment paying for their career training the system needs some major overhauling
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very faint top right corner of the ad look closely i agree very tedious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it wold have to be some out of town graders
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my towns paper has its own website you have to be a subscriber to read it though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are at most health departments in the area
UpliftingNews,not_removed,condoms are already cheap as it is better education is the way to go people need to smarten up getting kids when you cant afford diapers is fucking stupid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i left walmart and after contemplating for a few miles in the car i called asked to speak to the manager and snitched that cashier right the fuck out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it doesnt not work for enough people to make it the highest stolen item
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not to say you feel this way i definitely dont i understand how life can take unexpected turns and how it seems that when it rains it pours i just know some people get bent out of shape by parents asking for help because they think its irresponsible for people to have kids when theyre struggling financially my personal take on it is that like you said things happen job loss death in the family illness etc and sometimes people need a little extra help and even if someone is being irresponsible their kids shouldnt suffer for it but im an admitted bleeding heart liberal i never thought we would be struggling to make minimum payments or keep food on our table or diapers on my sons butt tragedy and hardship can hit anyone at any time believe me i know we dont have kids but my husband and i went from being in pretty good financial shape to both of us losing our jobs literally a week apart followed by unexpected deaths in our families and some thankfully minor but expensive medical issues for both of us life can really hit you with quadruple whammies sometimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think anyone meant those messages for you and others like you but rather those who were struggling to keep food on the table before they had kids not that people like that would listen anyway but whatever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its easy to imagine those messages are targeting you but really its aimed at the young and the continuously almost permanent poor not those who suffer rapid downward economic mobility
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id bet their lawyer thought to make all participants sign a waiver which put in some cap in retail value andor the right for the store to decide to otherwise restrict how much of what a person could get i am not a lawyer but thats what id do if i were going to try offering such a promotion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,need a toilet to flush the worst off and a airtight container with chlorinated water afterwords wash as you would any then else dont put in washer before the gut bacteria is dead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my family doesnt have a choice normal diapers leads break outs for my family with niecesnephews i have seen it done add chlorinated water to the container and flush the worst part of the diaper before putting it in then frequent access is not needed once a week you have or extra loads the cost at launderettes does not compare to buying diapers and if you do not have access to a washer your there anyway to do your own laundry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my question is how would they stop someone from washing diapers i dont think ive ever seen a worker at a laundromat in my whole life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dunno about where you live here no one it there but i guess if someone showed up they get upset if they assumed they are fresh or worse old nasty diapers but then calm down once you show them that it have been soaking in chlorine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really thought the resource was time when you dont have access to one then you rinse and boil them after soaking i remember my mother doing so when we where down on our luck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously id like an answer as well it didnt sound like these kids were conceived out of a rape so where does the nondecision part come into play
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not having a choice would mean inability to afford effective contraception failed contraception of any kind and legal financial or travel related barriers to abortion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,about half of pregnancies are planned some people have reason to believe they are sterile some people are raped some people use contraception that fails some people can afford kids when they have them and fall on hard times after the fact some people attempt to get an abortion and find that the obstacles put in place by the government are too great nearby clinics forced to close no car to travel cant take the time off for waiting periods pay for hotel rooms father was supposed to help pay and he bails no one to watch current kids etc of course there are some people in the world who only care about themselves but people who are quick to make assumptions about others virtue without considering their circumstances are a far greater plague on humanity than poor people who reproduce no one ever seems to talk much about neglectful rich and middle class parents of which there are plenty so are we really hating on people for making selfish choices or for being poor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can have protected sex where the protection doesnt work and not have access to abortion services celibacy and giving away your kid to a stranger arent better than raising a kid for many people you can also become poor after having had kids already
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they say every third child born is chinese
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think since the chinese took the ban of only having one kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i worked in retail too in a music store no less theyre like a training facility for the shoplifting olympics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do it bro
UpliftingNews,not_removed,basically youre saying you want to force other people to pay for it so you can feel like youre helping when really youre not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre fucked in the head then its as simple as that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that could be the case though one hopes that people actually have some savings etc before they decide on more kids i know not everyone has savings but if they dont maybe waiting a while before having more kids and saving up some money is a good idea that still doesnt justify theft or teaching your kids to steal or using them as a means to steal a pair of shoes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i suppose you think every crime anyone has ever committed should land them in jail regardless of the circumstances surrounding it the officer made a judgment call instead of sending these people to jail and the children into foster care both of which are heavily flawed and overcrowded he chose to give them another chance that they needed some generosity and to be informed of the assistance available to them or perhaps you would rather pay taxes to keep them in jail im not justifying theft im saying that your assumption that they just decided having a child in poor circumstances is ignorant and unfounded and again you say they fucked up do you know them do you know that they really made this terrible decision there was nothing that happened fully outside of their control but that isnt even the point its so easy to say what choices anyone should have made but lets be realistic here no one can change the past so what does it accomplish to say what they should have done no they should not steal but maybe just maybe if more officers acted this way people like this would make better decisions and i never said i didnt agree with abortion only that some dont but assuming these people were in a bad position when that child was conceived and saying abort or put it up for adoption is once again ignorant on that note maybe they were in a better position when they decided to try for that child do you know it was an accidental pregnancy no then maybe saying they couldnt afford a kid and therefore should not have had a kid is just another unfounded assumption the whole point of my argument with what youve said is your assumptions there is nothing in this article about what these people are like so why do you feel the need pass judgment and pretend to know the circumstances theft is theft and they got caught the officer is in that position to determine how to handle it he had the facts and made the decision he felt was befitting based on that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i had been on it for ten years before anything happened so i assumed it was working life happens and you cant expect everything to go as planned and who knows maybe this couple was financially stable when their kids were born we had to rely on food stamps for awhile when the restaurant my husband worked for closed unexpectedly people go through hard times and it isnt always preventable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of the parents i come across on a daily basis come off as complete trash thats a high number gonna need you to cite your sources
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for saying that too often when people talk about parenting its do i want a kid instead of can i actually care for a kid not to mention a lot of people dont even ask questions about it they just end up with an oops baby
UpliftingNews,not_removed,without insurance my bc is for months luckily i make decent money for someone living paycheck to paycheck thats not really in their budget also dont forget the doctor fees to go get it prescribed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,without insurance it can be very expensive of course it depends on the method and your area of the country but hormonal birth control usually ranges from per month a single pack of emergency contraceptive was the last time i had to buy one four years ago so no not more expensive than having a child but if you dont have the money onhand you dont have the money public health services and organizations like planned parenthood help a lot to cover the costs for people who cant afford to pay for birth control but this is limited by lack of access in my area of texas the nearest planned parenthood is miles away but some people have to drive two hours or more to get to one there is also a serious lack of education so people take birth control pills incorrectly or rely on methods that they think are effective that arent like pulling out you absolutely can still conceive using the pullout method improper condom use happens all the time too these people dont know they are being irresponsible and thats a danger in and of itself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my comment was in response to the one making a pat judgement that people who cant afford children shouldnt have them nothing i said was in justification of shoplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who owns the diapers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sure theyve been shoplifting diapers for the yr old kid they have for years or maybe things were totally fine for years and then shit hit the fan after they already had kids where should they return them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i went through a few rough months after the corporation i worked for went out of business and i struggled to find a job with a comparable salary even though i worked my kids didnt starve but we did eat pretty lean and if it werent for my gracious parents and the foresights to inherit a lot of money it could have got pretty damn bad guess i was selfish having kids in this world when i obviously could have predicted that a decade later i might lose my job damn me and my trashcan parent self
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was the wallpaper yellow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so they can sell it for a profit yay capitalism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so all babies should be brought up for free should baby food be free clothes etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the hero reddit needs but not the one it deserves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,umm could you link a good journalist it is a serious question because the only people i hear discuss journalistic integrity are unemployed college students its a real issue but ive seen absolute nothing done to counter it journalists just like everyone else follow the money i dont think any profession is above it doctors lawyers politicians journalists and so on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah it might be a horrible thing to say and yeah theres plenty of good journalists but unfortunately there seems to be more bad ones its a vocal minority type thing but journalists should be held to a higher standard when it comes to responsible journalism i like this quote i heard awhile ago theres no truth in the news and no news in the truth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lets not discuss corruption because we have a feel good story there are a lot of good ones but they shame themselve when they cover the bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats fine i wasnt really about to get into a heated debate on upliftingnews you are still wrong though regardless i fail to see how any time would be bad for fighting insane amounts of corruption and lack of any accountability saying not right now is just verbally kicking the can down the road aka the entire problem youre part of itbut i digress you can feel good in this one thread sure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,target has spent a lot of time and money developing their loss prevention departments they even operate a state of the art forensics laboratory in minnesota they actually help law enforcement agencies solve cases with their lab and the technicians they employ target is on the forefront of criminal investigations
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for reference target usually keeps a file of repeat offenders they wont stop you on your first time but let the charges accrue stealing once wont usually get anything done legally but once youve stolen x many dollars it becomes a felony and then they bring the book down on you cause the charges and consequences will actually stick additionally most of the cameras you see are mostly a decoy or deterrent even if they are functional most are not but even the fake or real visible ones are positioned in such a manner as to create what appears to be a safe spot without coverage when in actuality thats where all the hidden micro cameras are located thieves will funnel to that location thinking they are clever when actually thats the most vulnerable position that kind of stuff on top of forensics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i bet thats exactly why they do it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good people dont steal once they do they dont become good people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,almost anywhere that takes care of kids is better than parents that would rather get shitfaced than buy diapers for there own baby
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no prison system is churning out model citizens not all people who go in come out as bad or worse than they went in though some people can change if you help them see that they are making bad choices plus im not sure how you made the jump from bad parents breaking the law and spending the income they have on booze instead of diapers maybe not needing to keep custody to the whole school housing thing just because you think criminals should be punished accordingly doesnt mean you want poor people to stay poor and stupid edited for clarity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you could have said that without being such a dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its really not though theft is theft stores are not charities the owner has kids too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so did you report her for violating the rules of section unemployment is a tricky one dont fall correctly into a specific guideline and youre screwed but if you hadnt been denied and had your schooling paid for you wouldnt have a problem with the system i was speaking more to ssiwelfare which doesnt pay enough to support you without some type of outside assistance which most times breaks the rules of the program yes needs an overhaul the issue is the people who do the overhaul are so far out of touch from our reality they dont actually know how to effectively fix it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was nearly offscreen for me i could only see like less than half of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh about that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good for you when i was a kid there was a time when my family was in a situation not unlike yours and as an adult now itd have made me sick to have been in your shoes and watched that happen im glad you spoke up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i knew you werent advocating the dont breed attitude but your comment sent me on a tirade because i started thinking about it and its been a particularly rough day i am also admittedly more bleeding heart than i sometimes would like to be lol and yikes im so sorry that all happened to you at once i hope things are much better now or at least on their way to it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure i absolutely get that its not personal in any case but when youre already feeling shitty about something its sometimes hard not to feel worse when you see or hear things like that its already difficult to have to ask for help add to it the fact that i have a pretty serious pride and stubbornness issue lol without the extra negativity whether its directly geared at you or not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats true it still stings though as a new mom who had every intention of doing things right its just a bumper sticker just a meme but when youre going through a crappy time it can really just add insult to injury i try not to take it personally because you cant possibly know everyones individual situation but then there are those days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah its such a nuisance when those pesky poor people reproduce if they dont have money they shouldnt be allowed to have a family
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well when you are a police officer in that situation feel free to make that judgement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so leave the kids at home and steal then got it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this whitey year old vision of criminals needs to stop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not acceptable but it does require a different reaction than a criminal arrest good for the cop to see the differernce its one thing to steal wants and another to steal needs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,by the time youre so broke that youre nicking nappies you cant afford the initial outlay for reusable ones thats the difference between being frugal and bones of your arse broke everyones circumstances are difference the last i went to a laundrette their self service section was out of action indefinitely and their service washes are like £ up so when our ex landlord took his time getting our washing machine fixed i hand washed in the tub wouldnt fancy doing that with nappies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sometimes they are hiding and watching from a concealed back room to avoid being held up when i had to use one a while ago one of the employees popped out of seemingly nowhere to make me change when their change machine was down there were mirrors on one of the walls the entrance to their room must have been in an adjacent unit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well then i guess you are one of the lucky ones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my guess poor education that leads to people not very familiar with contraception
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how could you possibly tell whether kids are conceived through rape you cant at all i mean i was never trying to make the point that they were but dismissing the possibility out of hand because a male was present is faulty logic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which would still leave adoption
UpliftingNews,not_removed,about half of pregnancies are planned pregnancies not children most children are planned
UpliftingNews,not_removed,celibacy and giving away your kid to a stranger arent better than raising a kid for many people a lot of our social programs are justified with the logic its what best for the child that reasoning should extend here adoption may not be what you want but its whats best for the child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why should you care what these people want what i care about is the children that got born into a family where their parents focused more on their naughty tingles than they did on the possible life or in this case lives theyd be bringing into the world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i do believe this is what those in the know might refer to as a joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok know i see why your comment was funny didnt know about that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought it was every fourth we always joked my little brother was chinese
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can confirm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,third child here can confirm i bleed teriyaki sauce
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats what we call democracy and really it is helping people i dont give the money directly to the needy but i dont think they mind that too much as long as their kids get what they need all the way through university if they so wish what do you think really helps kids random acts of kindness a diaper here a set of clothes theres or a robust social security network but to be honest i dont see it as helping i see it as my duty and i dont go around getting a warm fuzzy feeling from paying taxes i just pay them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,brexit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,might be i blame my parents for teaching me that stealing is bad good thing these parents are teaching their kids better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its anecdotal evidence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well you mustve missed the fact that i was addressing him bringing up actually planning and giving birth to a child read procreation and not what should happen if and or when shit goes south after you have a kid under good circumstances
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honestly i do not remember it was the mid so anything is possible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,babies that stay in dirty diapers for longer periods of time are exposed to various health concerns so therefore should be taken care of edit keep in mind im talking about it being free for those in need
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we deserve nothing but brimstone and hellfire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can think of many good journalists and a handful of quality publications my real point though was a lot of the fault lays with the consumer who doesnt read quality journalism anymore journalists and publications that try not to lower their standards for news go out of business or become blogs then we all go on reddit and complain that journalists are all shitty when in reality they are all exactly as shitty as the collective we wants them to be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had a russian friend back in college who would use that saying a lot and i couldnt agree more im just arguing that the second half is the fault of the consumer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont disagree but this is one of those feel good stories lets keep it feeling good there are plenty of other stories about cops to talk about the issues within their ranks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one does not simply shoplift from target
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre also handson meaning they can and will grapple with you until youre in cuffs and god forbid if you swing on them theyre allowed to defend themselves and the whole boo hoo i stole because im a piece of shit and tried to hit an lp officer they have an obligation to retreat first them fucking me up wasnt self defense doesnt fly the cops are taking lps side most retailers are hands off meaning theyll approach you and try to coaxthreatenintimidateoutsmart you back into their lp office but if you walk away oh well not much they can do target dont play that shit either you come back with them or you better start running if you dont choose one of those two options be prepared to fight ive seen people get fucked up like tackled from behind and punched in the head while on the ground fucked up legal no but good luck proving anything happened if something like that happens you better believe it was out of camera range thats why they did it you can complain all you want no one is going to believe you youre the criminal here not them and thats why you dont fuck with target lp
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all we can do up here is stay inside and research things anyway the doors are usually snowed shut
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in high school i was approached by an lp officer in the parking lot of my local target he accused me of stealing a cd from the store as id been seen on camera shuffling thru multiple discs mind you at and earning my own money working in retail id pick out all the cds i wanted and then narrow my choice down to i looked at the officer and showed him my receipt of purchase he said he saw me pocket several other discs frankly i could not understand where he thought id put the discs as i was wearing running shorts and a fitted tee i was not carrying a handbag just my keys and wallet i told my mom about it and she went ape shit on the phone with management
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh damn had no idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,makes their brand name actually pretty fitting if target ends up failing as a retailer they could go into the wholesale forensics business
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats kinda awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,til that target is like baskin robbins they always find out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not in australia they arent most stores do not have security here the staff cannot physically stop you soooo its pretty much open season
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they should move some of these funds to sales and research maybe they wouldnt have flopped so hard in canada im still a little bitter about that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive always wondered about that seems silly to me to spend all the money on cameras and then a leave blatant blind spot ive seen a suspicious button sized thing before in one of those blind spot areas now i wonder if it wasnt a camera that was in a walmart though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but once youve stolen x many dollars it becomes a felony and then they bring the book down on you happened to a shitty neighbor of mine he got sentenced to nine months in prison for stealing cakes they let it build up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait so how would u go about finding the real cameras im not trying to rob target here just curious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that seems like a childs mindset though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like an abusive foster home with foster parents that are only in it for the money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant blame him for being a dick though that is some stupid ass pedagogy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no he couldnt the guy he was responding to is retarded and deserves to be verbally bitch slapped
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you pay taxes by chance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you clearly need to upgrade to a larger phone all your fault of course
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its getting there thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is a nuisance when my fucking tax dollars are paying for their kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess if your down to nicking nappies nick reusable ones but also grab some chlorinecontainer and your set no need to go back after a few days to steal more its a piece of fabric no need to be gentle if you dont have access to a washer change the water a few times after they have soaked in chlorinated water then dumping them in boiling water for a bit that is how my mother did it for my little brother we where too poor for the launderette and you could only get access to the buildings washers once every days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thatsterrifying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,technically it is sometimes an option but not always a preferable or viable option when it is one not every child is perfectly healthy or has desirable traits for potential adoptive families not every birth parent can face walking away from a child they carried or considers that gamble a better option than stepping up the best they can ranking options as abortionraising a child surrendering a child for adoption is also valid its still unplanned regardless no one deserves to be shamed for not giving their kids away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,technically youre correct of births are unplanned in the us which would mean are planned still when over in children are unplanned the argument that most are planned isnt really a valid argument against anything i said
UpliftingNews,not_removed,condoms are realistically about effective not everyone can afford hormonal birth control and not everyone can take it i happen to be one of the people that cant take it tubals and vasectomies are permanent which isnt acceptable for people who actually want kids eventually and do cost a lot if you can actually find a doctor willing to perform them on young childless people if you think that realizing that someone cant possibly pay for something is just giving shitheads a pass youre clueless everyone whos not well off should just be celibate and alone right should people who take ill or lose their jobs just give up their kids for adoption i see below that you grew up poor fantastic lots of people you grew up with are still poor and you made it big too bad your parents are all nothing but selfish shitheads who should have been sterilized and none of you should ever have been born
UpliftingNews,not_removed,assuming all adoptable kids are wanted lots of kids age out of the system before finding a family
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but it often isnt best not every child is healthy or desirable by people who are looking to adopt many end up bounced around through foster homes and i dont think that whats best for the child should ever be the sole consideration either
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you must not have a child one doesnt just give a child up because times are tough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i care because adults have every right to happiness that children do not everyone can access or safely take birth control it doesnt always work and not everyone has access to abortion services or the resources available to live in any other way than hand to mouth whether its their fault or not sometimes it isand sometimes its not sometimes they want kids and do plan for them and then become ill and cant afford them after the fact sometimes they were raised that way themselves and know nothing else of course i feel for kids who are poor doesnt mean i stop giving a shit about everyone else and their problems in the meantime
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i still dont get it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah my family is john jason xing wu and beth we have our bets on jason being chinese he is the best at math
UpliftingNews,not_removed,teriyaki sauce is japanese not chinese
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so basically youre lazy you want credit for helping via taxes when you really probably donate relatively very little in taxes you think youre being charitable but actually youre not youre just forcing other people to be charitable try donating and getting tax write offs then at least you can show some semblance of helping people in need until then youre just some lazy keyboard hero who wants to take credit for other people helping
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was being flippant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and a goddamn opened safe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,truth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,religion is that you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in soviet russia target shop lifts you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre also handson meaning they can and will grapple with you until youre in cuffs and god forbid if you swing on them theyre allowed to defend themselves and the whole boo hoo i stole because im a piece of shit and tried to hit an lp officer they have an obligation to retreat first them fucking me up wasnt self defense doesnt fly the cops are taking lps side most retailers are hands off meaning theyll approach you and try to coaxthreatenintimidateoutsmart you back into their lp office but if you walk away oh well not much they can do oh i thought the hands off approach was because by law thats all theyre allowed to do so it is the case that the stores would have the authority to touch and physically restrain people and they just choose not to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope they get paid accordingly can you imagine every time you take down a shoplifter you have to hope theyre smart enough to just take whatever charges are coming you could easily get stabbed concussed lose teeth lose an eye injure your spine etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats why you kill the target lp
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you work at that lab
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,australian targets are a completely separate company from target in america they stole the logo and name because target didnt copyright its logo in australia
UpliftingNews,not_removed,walmart uses micro cameras at the entrance and exit everywhere from the floor to the ceiling so if you try just keeping your head down with a hood up to avoid cameras they still get a good face shot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,take a pic with your cell phone you will see a red flash on the spot on the screen on your phone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not sure you used that word correctly ive actually never seen it kind of weird that you used it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good point imagine the tax cuts we could get if we just introduced some laws which outlawed certain people breeding i mean it might completely undermine freedom and autonomy but the dollars
UpliftingNews,not_removed,regardless no one deserves to be shamed for not giving their kids away if not giving your kids away results in them being miserable sick or even dying then absolutely you deserve it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a joke about statistics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,never said i was good at being chinese
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have no idea what you are trying to argue and it definitely has nothing to do with my op
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and i was explaining your joke 😂
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but well never get what we deserve
UpliftingNews,not_removed,depending on state and shopkeepers laws yes you can use force if necessary to restrain shoplifters as long as you identify yourself and declare that you are making a citizens arrest but of course there is liability if you mess up such as possible kidnapping and assault charges so yeah most companies just say fuck it dont touch anyone its not worth the possible lawsuits if you make a mistake
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i absolutely agree with you that lp approach leads to things like the killdozer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait wait wait cameras on the floor pointing up so how many up skirts does walmart currently have on file
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you decide to make a backyardfirework and end up giving yourself burns i shouldnt have to pay for your stupidity its not about income or class but responsibility nice try redirecting though you worthless troll
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh what if you give them to someone who has a biokid and your child ends up disfavoured what if they get trafficked or neglected or abused by the adoptive family or never find one and just age out of foster care what if you throw them out of the frying pan and into the fire you can just wash your hands clean of that nope thats on you if you intend to neglect them from the get go and let them die of course dont try to keep them having a baby while poor isnt abuse though and neither is becoming poor if you have kids already stop assuming the worst of people not everyone agrees with you as to whats best and no ones obligated to meet your particular standard in order not to be a careless piece of shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait my sisters the third kid and isnt chinese probably because shes a girl
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im saying quit blaming the government for societies problems and make a difference yourself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we need to work on our communication or this act is going nowhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not enough of the hot ladies and too many of chumbo sized
UpliftingNews,not_removed,redirecting i wasnt the one who changed the subject to fireworks wtf its not irresponsible to have children because you dont have money having a child is not playing with fire it is an intrinsic biological force that drives our species denying it is taking away one of the most fundamental parts of a persons being and reason to exist you can try to rationalize your greed by comparing someones right to reproduce with another who plays with fireworks because if you lump them all together you can pretend youre not a selfish fuckwit who would deny peoples rights to procreate and see someone suffer a lifetime of pain after not receiving medical attention from burns because you wont pay for it and theyre stupid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that sounds strong and self reliant but you aint gonna fix any problems with a little charity unless you mean that the difference to be made is a change to the society itself which was between the lines in my op
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is that legal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the change is with you donating to charity not empowering the government more to make yourself feel better thats a horrible and lazy attitude to have if you feel its a problem and the government does a good job at fixing it youre more than welcome to pay more in taxes than you have to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i told you times to get back in coach you hairy bitch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats awesome ink definitely isnt cheap i really hope with all the good theyre doing that the tattoo shop gets it paid forward as well they deserve it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is uplifting especially as a lifelong maryland resident its awfully nice to see something other than how much of a hellhole baltimore is make headlines
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they have a gofundme page i wonder if theyd take money mailed to them as well how much does the ink and supplies for a tattoo cost
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jewish wolverine huh seems like it could lead to a predicament see video
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know how much the supplies cost but my tattoo artist charges for his work so hours and hours dedicated to free tattoos can definitely set an artist back financially i would think considering still having to buy said supplies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats incredible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the black santa emoji has a purpose now🎅🏿
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont see how its uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a white santa
UpliftingNews,not_removed,since when was that something uplifting not something bad but
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uplifting as its a small sign of our progress towards equality and respect for all people particularly during these contentious political times
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope idiot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was gonna read itbut i refuse to give them my email in order to do it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this one doesnt require an email to read
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for reposting the world needs to see this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,titanic level shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sweet bitter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuckin women
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more tragic than uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so will it be born twice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have looked for this elsewhere but couldnt find it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everyone should know the joy of rescue dogs heres mine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,peta all animals nightmare
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats awesome way to rescue but just a touch of reality peta is a monster and dont deserve your support they euthanize of the dogs they rescue their stated goal is to destroy certain breeds due to the predjudice of their founder
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why even own a dog if youre going to keep them in conditions like that people like that piss me off we leave our dogs outside in a similar pen during the day while were at workbut as soon as we get home we let them out and they come inside and cuddle with us and get on the couch and everything a dog should be allowed to do why would someone even want to own a dog and leave it outside like that people fucking suck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok sweet story but that was the worst video i was super hyped for two overly excited dogs like the ones you see when a military person comes home one was perfectly still and their interaction was just like if any two dogs would meet the whole time i just kept thinking take the leashes off glad they were rescued missed opportunity for internet entertainment edit typo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is so sweet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,could also share with rbeforenafteradoption
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awe thats so cute i want a dog lol i already have a pug but i wanna rescue a dog﻿
UpliftingNews,not_removed,poor dogs beibg kept in thet small cage thanks for lettibg them free﻿
UpliftingNews,not_removed,finally peta did something besides release animals into the wild that have no chance of living that way fuck peta
UpliftingNews,not_removed,peta people for the ethical treatment of animals paid for their veterinary care then got the brother and sister into a shelter with a high adoption rate ya what a terrible nightmare
UpliftingNews,not_removed,source like most governments or any rational person peta believes that an animal is better off being put to sleep rather than being left in a cage warehoused in a shelter for life or left to suffer and die slowly as a feral animal people who are unable to do basic maths and understand supply and demand of pets people who believe that animals have a spiritual right to life and people looking to criticize peta seem to latch on to that directly from the horses mouth httpwwwpetaorgaboutpetawhypetanokillshelters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,throw the pug in a storm drain come back a day later and your have yourself a dog to rescue problem solved
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rpupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres no point in not having it misanthropy is a selffulfilling prophecy that negates even the opportunity for progress
UpliftingNews,not_removed,after seeing everyone stand up and protest at the womens march the people who got up and went to airports and stood up for muslims being discriminated against the overwhelming donations to causes to help immigrants and to keep our constitution strong and lawful the massive donations and clean up towards the desecrated jewish cemeteries and the burnt mosques and the people standing up for those who need protection in this world id say my faith in humanity is pretty strong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not really no
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is ivanka there and not the first lady
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how uplifting thanks s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if trump had just a little more patients and took his intel briefings more serious would he even need to make this trip in the first place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like i said before even a blind squirrel
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually i lost my best friend overseas a few years ago and every president acknowledges when a soldier dies the only way this was uplifting is if you were uplifted by the president doing his job otherwise its just yet another story about an awesome young man not getting to raise his children i didnt mean to take the political bait but the article made me sad so did obama which is why i sat out the last presidential election cycles ie im not an obama supporter however i am among a small minority of people who really want to support trump but dont yet and this article did humanize him so maybe thats why you presumed it was uplifting and id agree with that part but dead soldiers are saddening
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love dishonest titles such as this after reading it youd think that renewable energy was actually making a difference its not httpsenwikipediaorgwikirenewableenergyintheunitedstates the other is nonrenewable and this completely ignores all the energy we get from oil if you include that renewables are like or of the energy humans use the other is nonrenewable so tell me again how renewables are smashing records and taking over the world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its smashing records in that more countries notably underdeveloped ones are investing more money and resources than ever into renewables that nations globally are starting to make the switch no shit renewable energy sources are only a few of the total energy used there hasnt been even close to the investment that nonrenewables have seen dont be a cynical asshole criticizing the misleading title and be glad that change is starting to happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never got why people dont just give an animal to adoption or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the news article i saw on tv said that places in canada serve as slaughter houses selling the horse meat to other countries like mexico and japan that view it as a delicacy money talks i suppose
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are costly to maintain no one wants an old lame horse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also want to add i didnt know this was happening to horses in the usa wanted to spread some awareness and hopefully this lady that paid to save them can get some crowd funding to help her out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the writer says the day went off with out a hitch does that mean there was no marriage s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im pretty sure its not the only big fat thing he got to throw on that night
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait which ones their son
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why are you posting this click bait shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not exactly what she said she said she would unless she wouldnt she gave herself a loophole
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my first thought was that the dishwasher was a machine i need to sleep
UpliftingNews,not_removed,guests book tables months in advance to taste deepfried moss edible flowers live ants and other noma specialties interesting a typical tasting menu starts at mr sonko will be nicely rewarded for his loyal service
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is why bill gates wants dishwashers to pay taxes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry to say but youre the third person that posted this lmao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tbf they were the ones who probably took it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,👍😆
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i delivered pizza for the past year theres one lady who had ms and was confined to her wheelchair so i always picked up a pack of cigarettes on the way for her sometimes a little help can go a long way for a person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre a good person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty lucky as far as that birth defect goes being connected at the hands and all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im confusedit says they were conjoined by their abdomen not hands edit looks like someone didnt watch the video
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no shit it was a joke about the picture it says they are conjoined twins and they are holding hands making it almost seem as if they are conjoined at the hands it makes it even funnier because separating their hands is then a life saving surgery looks like someone doesnt have a sense of humor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida oh no girl oh jesus asks her stepdad oh jesus no to legally adopt her on his birthday oh never mind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as someone who really never had a strong relationship with their father to say the least this was something worth sharing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes a rays fan so these are probably his first tears of joy in a very long time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpsyoutubesycghglrsq this one is really emotional edit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think i have a new personal record for fastest transition from completely fine to tears in my beard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is so beautiful i always had dads my biological father and my stepfather i recently got married and my favorite moment of the wedding was surprising my stepdad with a first dance it was honestly one of the most touching moments of my life hes a macho marine guy and he was crying while simultaneously having the biggest grin on his face while we danced it was awesome i absolutely love this video and it reminded me of that moment clarification edit my biological father walked me down the aisle i had two separate first dances my biological dad knew i would surprise my stepdad with a special dance my biological dad even helped me pick out the song to dance to with my stepdad they have a good relationship it was a very happy and fun wedding full of lots of love my stepdad and biological dad are both wonderful men who i admire for different reasons im very close to both of them and love them both very much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive been a stepfather for about years now my own daughter is still a big part of my life but hasnt lived under my roof since she was i think i have a great relationship with her my stepdaughter and her mom and i still love together and have done so since she was she has had a very rocky relationship with her own dad his lack of participation in doing family things is a big reason why my wife left him unfortunately that didnt prompt him to try harder in spite of all of that im often reminded of feeling guilty that i never find balance i choose quality over quantity in terms of time spent with my daughter who has a difficult mother with whom she still lives i can always be there for my stepdaughter because she lives with us and i know when she needs support in fact she would rather turn to me than her mom for most difficult situations and chooses to share only good things with her mom so when i think of my stepdaughter getting married i wonder how to talk with her to make sure she knows its ok if she wants her father to be there in the capacity that most fathers would want when their daughter gets married i cant imagine how hurt id be if my daughter chose someone else to step in for me i also dont want my stepdaughter to think i dont want that tremendous honour or that it isnt important to me she shouldnt have to wrestle with such a decision when there will be so many other stresses and concerns maybe one of us can walk her down the aisle partway and then the other takes over i know id cry if she asked me to walk her down the aisle she hasnt even been asked yet although mom and i think it will happen next year and im already trying to anticipate how can i make this good for everyone tldr being a stepfather i get how powerfully emotional this would be and its what ill ever experience
UpliftingNews,not_removed,joking around taking forever to open the present looking in all the bits of tissue paper then getting ott exciting about the penthat guy is such a dad

UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is amazing im the horrible guy on the other side of the papers the biological father my daughters mother and i had a horrible relationship she was young i was just out of the military and we just did not get along well we tried very hard for the sake of our child but it just did not work out her family got involved and basically tore what little we had apart from us i raised my daughter alone for the first year of her life and then her mother got pregnant again by an active duty marine who she married for the benefits and whatever else thats her choice when i found out they got marriedher family was already telling my daughter that he was her daddy i asked him to meet me not a confrontation but as a father to a stepfather we met shook hands and exchanged plesantries he was a good man and i was not upset in the least i ended up moving away after multiple visititation hearings and even though i was granted the visitation and custody she did not follow the courts orders for whatever reason she had i started a new career met a woman and moved in with her still sent my daughter gifts contacted her mother about how she was and got pictures all of the time then it stopped i was traveling through my home state and she had found out through mutual friends and demanded that i sign over my rights as a father so her stepfather could legally adopt her i spoke with my family and my closest friends and decided that it was what was best for my daughter considering her mother and is relationship and signed over my rights her father now is an officer in the marine corps the email updates stopped being sent gifts were returned to sender and i have had no contact for years now and i accept that as a consequence to what i agreed to but i know my daughter has a good life and i am happy for her so just because children are adopted isnt always a bad thing i hope one day she shows up at my door demanding answers but i also know it may not happen at all and thats okay as well its a consequence what i did does not mean i dont want my daughter in my life at all its the exact opposite i miss her every day and i think about her all the time but i know she is happy and healthy and as a biological father thats all you can ask for im happy for this woman and her adopted father

UpliftingNews,not_removed,i adopted my wifes son a few years ago at the time since he had been living with me since he was very young it felt a bit like a formality but as hes gotten older and comes in contact with friends at school that have nontraditional parental situations it makes me super proud that he tells his friends i adopted him hes but already understands our relationship is not subject to changes or whims hes my son good bad whatever he doesnt have to worry about whether dad will be there

UpliftingNews,not_removed,whos the one who brought onions into this post
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey im a florida girl that did this in nice to know im not the only halfadopted kid out there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this and the other videos linked are just awesome my wife asked her parents to adopt her when she was so she could be theirs before our daughter was born her biological uncle took custody of her when she was a few weeks old and raised her as his own but his sister her biomom would never let him adopt her when she asked them their reaction was more confusion over them never having thought to do it after she was since her biomom would not allow it before that the lawyer that did her original custody work did the adoption for us as well which was kinda cool he was excite as they were
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a stepdad this makes me smile my stepdaughter started to introduce me to her friends and others as dad recently and it made my heart swell step parents often dont get much credit but stuff like this makes it all worthwhile
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i recently walked my stepdaughter down the aisle i dont care what any paper says shell always be my daughter her biological father lives about miles away and has missed out on knowing a great woman his loss i figure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok i didnt read the full article but it seems that the daughter is how exactly do you legally adopt someone that is not a minor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty much the complete opposite of my brother my dad met my mom when my brother was years old his biological dad took off and never contacted and according to my mom from day treated him like his own child but my brother never gave shits about my dad dad coached him in baseball he would work with him for hours on end on anything he wanted he helped him paint warhammer figures ffs he was a damn good stepdad and what did my brother give him in return when he turned he told him hes not his father he never looked at him as a father figure and proceeded to track down his real life dad something his real life dad had never tried to do with him and proceeded to call him dad something he never once called my father his real life dad by the way is a junkie that turned my brother into a junkie and now theyre both in prison for attempting to rob a pharmacy sorry for the rant it still pisses me off to this day wish i had a sibling like this girl instead of the scumbag that is my brother

UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida girl happy ending stories florida man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is uplifting simply because its got florida girl at the beginning and isnt a story about methbath salts or fucking alligators or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that sites functionality is fucking awful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cry so easily
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as someone who didnt have any resemblance of a father i straight up bawled im glad theres guys out there stepping up where others should have
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my ex wife was a real asshole and moved mountains to keep me from my daughter we were finally reunited after years at her hs graduation after she bounced she knew the cs gravy train was over and just left stepdad and i get along really well mainly because we both had horrible experiences with this woman she now has dads in her life and has a strong relationship with both of us walking her down the aisle will be interesting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i must admit i got teary eyed reading this i never had a good relationship with my step dad bit hard when he took his faults out on me and my brother there was a period from when i was about till i moved out i felt he resented us and the life he trapped himself in the worst thing i can remember apart from the beatings i we got was that at the age of and on christmas day i discovered we did not get a single present not a single one i was heart broken and from that point it became a family tradition now i am nearly and made something of myself i am finally proud of myself and what i have become though i never had kids because i was so worried i would repeat the environment i grew up in my brother has had kids to different women around the world he never grew up claims he loves all his children so i guess that is why he does not pay for their support i always get uncomfortable around people who had a loving and safe environment to grow up in i am not jealous but i just wanted that for myself and to all my high school friends this is why i was a dick i was acting out but not one of you ever thought to ask me why edit grammar loves me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,til that i can adopt my stepdaughter when shes of age
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this really hits home i dont have parents but a long time ago my mom married a guy who has been my father im not related in any way anymore but hes my dad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats awesome i started the adoption process for my stepson hopefully it will be done soon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she reversed the selfie in the car so shed look like a passenger lies she was driving
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats this salty solution coming out of muy eyes omg i care i care
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that chick how
UpliftingNews,not_removed,late to the party but i have to put this out there my brother and i did this exact thing for to our stepdad over years ago gave him the adoption papers asked him to adopt us and asked if we could take his last name it was a very touching emotional special occasion but then my stepdad put the papers away and it wasnt brought up again for a year or so i remember asking him you said yes when are we going to do this and he said oh i really thought it was just the thought that counted ok lets do this brother and i were both adults so court was really just a formality it was incredible though getting to pick a parent best thing ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and now im in public trying not to cry my stepdad adopted me when i was younger and it has never been a question that he is my father it means the world to a child when someone takes them in as their own and makes them feel the same as if theyd been the parent all along years later my dad is still my hero and role model i never resent the guy that couldnt handle having a kid and ditched me and my mom because without him i wouldnt have my awesome dad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its nice to see loving and caring parentschildren out there all i got from my father was beatings so theres that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,manly tears they flow openly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my mums ex husband asked my father if he could adopt my sister and i my dad said no because it wasnt like he was absent we lived with him two weeks on and two weeks off and he loved us very much oddly enough he never really embraced me like a son either and years down the line he ended up divorcing my mum cause he was psychotic paranoid and just an asshole in general
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at work had to fight tears when watching the video read the article when she told me of course i cried she said i want his name fuck this is getting hard she said her other three children expressed they also wanted to be adopted by david but will do so in their own time oh man this is so good to hear well i barely managed to not cry stories like these really makes me love humanity again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love this story i have two adult stepsons that are my sons we all kids me my wife wanted me to adopt them for all of many years well that couldnt happen back then but after my wife passed away last winter my kids asked if i could now it wasnt because my wife died that it can now happen just in case anyone wonders anyways it sure feels good to have finally got it all lined up and shouldnt take but about a month or bit more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,weeks later gabriella sues for years back child support
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the most common reason to adopt an adult is for inheritance purposes in this case adult adoption allows someone to leave property or financial assets to the adopted individual more easily
UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida man finally steps up its nice to see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt know you could adopt an adult

UpliftingNews,not_removed,its nice seeing how many people have a good relationship with their stepdad i have never had that with mine in fact hes such a jackass that theyre on the brink of a divorce now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is simply amazing i came into my girlfriends life years ago she was a single mom of a little and a half year old and ive loved that kid more and more everday for these last years and everytime he calls me daddy it melts my heart now we are going to have one of our own in march and hes so excited to be a big brother yes things are extremely tough at first when you come into an already exisiting family and trying to fit into the dynamic of being a new mom or dad but its one of the best experiences of my life and look forward to the future and adopting him myself one day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow that one got me teared up right away as a man who married a widow and got the ultimate package deal wife daughter house and a cat all in the same ceremony ha had to wait to adopt her later due to legal complications but in our hearts daddy and daughter the whole time so happy for this guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wont lie i cried as i read this

UpliftingNews,not_removed,what is this wet stuff coming out of my eyes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i find everything with florida in it can be improved by pronouncing it florida like the musician
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i was i had no medical insurance but i needed a surgery and i jokingly asked some of my professors if they would adopt me so i could have my surgery maybe thats not a joke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,best part is when he checks to see if theres anything else in the bag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,forgot a gift again huh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish i had a dad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,alternative florida man did a good thing for once
UpliftingNews,not_removed,every single fucking one of these get me crying i have no idea why i am a grown man who wasnt adopted nor know anyone who was adopted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,on the front page there was a story about a girl asking her stepdad to adopt her and a man who threw an alligator at a person at a drive thru both from florida florida confuses me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida girls asks her stepdad yep i definitely thought the sentence would end differently

UpliftingNews,not_removed,yikes seen this on facebook weeks ago youre better than this reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,being a subscriber to rfloridaman changed the way i perceived this title
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hard to type with blurry eyes beautiful

UpliftingNews,not_removed,well this hit me like a ton of bricks wish more than anything i had the chance to be legally adopted by my stepdad he passed away in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like florida man could have gotten some much needed good press if this was worded from his perspective rather than the girl but still good for them

UpliftingNews,not_removed,im pretty sure thats more disapointing than your wife telling you shes pregnant instead of getting them as a baby you getting them when there most horomonal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thought i was in rfloridaman and they had some uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does this cost anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not being a dk but i do find some issues with this she is that makes her an adult no one is responsible for her life except herself if it was for family significance or whatever a lot of adults here would agree that they didnt have a dad or had a fup dad andor fup step dad andor step siblings when they were under years old and are thus stunned by the idea that might be fine but there are laws that help and hinder when it comes to having legal family ties so it would be wise to check this with an attorney before proceeding things can get very ugly when people ageget sickneed nursing homesdiedivorce or what have you if you own more than a pencil i personally think this was prediscussed and they found it legally and financially benefited both of them to all of ye who were ripped from having a good father this just goes to show you that even if youre an adult now it is possible you could find someone to adopt you without insidious loopholes and i hope every single one of you do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my cousin got pregnant at turned then had the baby and the father literally has had nothing to do with the kid she still sees her grandparents though very odd anyway my cousins partner turned a few months ago and the kid who is now changed her last name to his very touching

UpliftingNews,not_removed,david did not what to expect when he first saw the pen reacting very enthusiastically as if that was the only gift inside wellthat definitely checks out certified dad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had no idea a mentally competent person over the age of could undergo the adoption process legally is it any different then changing your name at that point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,almost the usagi drops plot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wut a florida girl story that doesnt involve nudity or police
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i plan on doing this next year at the earliest but might hold off til grandma on biological fathers side is gone on that i hope for many years as i dont think shed take it well i love her and would hate to ruin the relationship my biological father is more like and unlce that i barely talk to my step dad raised me from years old he fronted the bills where my bilogical father cheaped out and he did it a lot he taught me all the things daddies teach their kids he raised me to be strong and work hard and to not let my gender define me or hold me back he loves me as one of his own and i love him as my father itd be a nice gift for his birthday but my mom insists that i tell my biolgical fathers side of the family about it even if i dont take his name and i just dont think grandma can understand probably wont be taking his name though as ill likely be married by the time it happens and if not i will be soon after

UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not what i expected from a story that starts with florida person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i also had to wait until i was over before the man who actually raised me could officially adopt me its absolutely wonderful when you can legally declare something even if it doesnt change the actual relationship being able to use the last name you want on your paperwork not having to deal with questions like but whos your real father or have people correct you when you call him your dad happy adoption day lynde family
UpliftingNews,not_removed,were sure this was in florida seems out of place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am years old and wanted my step mother to adopt me i moved from my birth mothers house at the age of last year they said my biomom would have to sign over custody since she is still alive i didnt bother going further i know she wouldnt do it out of spite

UpliftingNews,not_removed,first comment in a long time that actually deserves to be on the top too fucking funny
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always get jealous when i see stuff like this it took me until my to realize that the reason i hated daddys girls so much is that i wish i could have been one so i feel ya this made me tear up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorta teared up a bit as i too have a poor relationship with my own dad jealous of the folks that get along with theirs so well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont have a dad so ive always been jealous of people that have one glad she got hers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am and asked my step dad to walk me down the isle at my wedding in july i then asked him to legally adopt me at my wedding we are currently in proceedings to have it done i introduced him as my dad to everyone at the wedding and i meant it i love that man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wouldnt ask my real father to adopt me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im grateful that people can have good relationships with their parents i used to be jealous but its just nice to see now even if i dont fully understand it from my own upbringing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,know what you mean ill admit i was crying for a good minute watching the video
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for sharing my dad went to jail when i was and wasnt back till i was a teen and mostly just bossed me around he ended up leaving my family and still wants a relationship i accept it only as a moving forward with my life he was my father but never my dad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a sweet gesture and obviously a sweet guy made me tear up it reminds me of my dad making a joke about not wanting to read shit but then realizes what it is and his sweetheart interior pokes through
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill adopt you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a cynical asshole i hoped it would open up and just read he said no thankfully there are good people out there that are not me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a positive florida man story is always worth sharing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,since like at least
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a phillies fan i appreciate this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh shit that one hit me hard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,three solid minutes of a very tattooed very good looking man sobbing with joy theres a lot of crying and talking in the first three minutes and the rest is basically him hugging his daughter and crying really emotional is an understatement worth the watch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as soon as that guy saw the words adult adoption he went into hysterics for minutes he is so full of love
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dad jokes are on point definitely a good guy i wanna see if theres anything in between theres nothing in between theres a pen i got a pen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck you i thought once was enough im going to be dehydrated by the end of these comments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh my dear god are there more of these videos and can more of them be posted to rupliftingnews please they are making me cry edit also my dad is being one of these awesome stepdads to my stepsister as her father didnt do well by her their relationship is fantastic and reminds me a lot of this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont have a beard and my facial hair doesnt grow very quickly so needless to say it took me a lot longer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my freshly salinated beard empathizes with you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my oldest stepdaughter recently got married her father is still alive we both walked her down the aisle he may have got first dance but she surprised me and everyone with cutting him short to bring me in and play stepfather of the bride for my turn i too had a very big grin and cried at the same time best thing ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my friend made me cry during her wedding her bio dad walked her halfway down the aisle and handed her to her step dad to take the the rest of the way i was sobbing like a bitch it was beautiful and both dads were blubbering with tears
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats sweet i assume you werent close with you biological father
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sure not everyone would chose to do this but when i got married i had my uncle and my dad walk me down the aisle i had my uncle because hes always there for me and is supportive like a dad and even though i have a rocky relationship with my dad i couldnt hurt him like that it meant a lot to me to have both of them with me on my wedding day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my dad used to do ott excited for socks and underwear at xmas lol i havent thought of that in years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck why did i click into that sub
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in there for minutesaaaaaaand im bawling
UpliftingNews,not_removed,here rhappycryingdads should help you keep your composure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not a judgment against you but im curious you say he legally adopted her because you signed the papers but why does that mean you cant contact her do you think you shouldnt for her own well being or something once you got gifts returned to sender why not go knocking and say you still want to see her since youve admitted you still miss her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,woah i read the article and went away feeling good but now it seems bittersweet after hearing the story from your perspective man i dont know what to say other than i hope all of you find reconciliation sometime in the future good luck to you and thanks for sharing this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it sounds like you did the best you could given the hand you were dealt the same holds true for what the girl in the video states papers dont mean anything you made a choice to step away so your daughter wouldnt be a victim to all the chaos that would have come from some serious legal battles you may regret this but its a part of why shes happy and healthy if you also make the choice to keep taking care of yourself shes gonna love the man that opens the door one day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what time zone are you in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never realized this was such a touching thing my mother remarried years ago and i asked my step dad to adopt me then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right there with you i have a stepdaughter thats only years old ive known her since she was born because her mother and i were friends before that time a few months later a verbally abusive relationship got worse she broke it off and we started dating a month later so since she was about months old ive had her every other day and i feel like shes my child i love her to death seeing something like this makes me lose it what an amazing young woman he raised for her to think of this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god dammit 😭 i wish you aaallll the best in life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,congrats
UpliftingNews,not_removed,adopted by the notorious rbg yes please
UpliftingNews,not_removed,her bf suggested adult adoption hes already off to a good start
UpliftingNews,not_removed,relationships with step dads
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the same way you adopt a kid with a birth certificate and everything last name gets changed if necessary when an incapacitated person becomes a legal adult they can be adopted so that someone is able to make decisions on their behalf source httpfamilylawfreeadvicecomfamilylawadoptionlawminorchildadopthtm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this was driving me crazy as well i think this explains it httpswwwlegalzoomcomarticlescanyoulegallyadoptanadult basically it establishes a legal parentchild relationship between the older adult and the younger adult with all the rights and responsibilities and wipes out the relationship with the biological parent so she takes his last name can more easily inherit money and property and can assume legal responsibility for him in his old age should he become disabled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uhh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive been waiting for a billionaire to adopt me all my life and now im now years old
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh went through something similar nowhere near that adopt me stage or anything like that but i was finally sort of warming up to the guy and accepting him as my moms new partner and then poof gone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,try asking him if you can be adopted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i think this is great but its not something i can relate to at all my moms new partner took a long time for me to adjust to and then he too turned out to be a total whack loser
UpliftingNews,not_removed,couldnt you have still kept your last name
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes not woody allen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also cried on the bus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in many ways its more of a formality between the stepfather and adult daughter ive heard it has some significance to estate law later down the line but here i assume based on my own experience its about being able to legally acknowledge the role hes had in her life in regards to the biological father though it severs any legal claim he might have over his daughter for example if there were a scenario where both adult daughter and mother were injured in an accident and unable to make their own medical decisions without any paperwork to the contrary the biological father could come in and start making decisions in her name about her care even if hes had no role in her life the stepdad could make the medical choices for his wife but would have no legal standing to do so for his stepdaughter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uhm yes you really thought the kid was theirs after marrying one of the parents just like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how do you adopt an adult
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always see this and nononono being linked is there a sub thats maybemaybemaybe thatd be fun i know about fifty fifty but thats all porn id rather not know the outcome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant handle the tension in that subreddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rfloridaman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people from florida seem crazy as hell from other parts of the country you always see a florida man was arrested today followed by a fucked up story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida is one of the few states to publish all arrests and convictions so the best current stories come from there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,born and raised in south florida myself florida has open media laws which means when something weird and crazy happens in fl everyone knows about it it makes us look like nutjobs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,florida has an open news law thingy that allows them to pretty much post whatever they want with crimes so they have people that sit there and take police reports as they happen and post articles about them thus the extremecrazy things that people do in fl are brought to light which while it happens everywhere has created a meme about florida known as florida man and a whole sub dedicated to it too rfloridaman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,only a florida man would have no idea about rfloridaman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,on til there is a story about a florida man throwing an alligator into a drivethru window and is being charged with assault with a deadly weapon so yeah there you go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ahhhh florida the australia of the united states
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a whole subreddit for weird florida news rfloridaman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously
UpliftingNews,not_removed,speak for yourself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a big brother heres a hug and a punch in the gut
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know exactly what you mean i actually get kind of angry when people talk about how much they enjoyed their childhood not at them more at the past i guess i can see how much they truly enjoyed it and that is something i will never have it almost feels like i was robbed of something the fact that they will never really understand how i couldnt have enjoyed my childhood is also somewhat alienating i dont let it outwardly effect me or my actions that would be unfair but the feeling is always there to some extent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive never hated people with good relationships with the fathers i just dont understand it i see my female friends who act like daddys girls or i see my male friends who have this great bro relationships with their dads and it just feels so foreign to me or really emotional moments like in this article when my friends talk about confiding their emotions in their dads it makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable because its something i just dont have any experience with i wouldnt say im jealous or something cuz i dont know any better it just seems foreign and alien to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,any suggestions for a father of two young girlsand a boy on how i can make them feel special loved etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,serious people hate daddys girls i suppose my girls are daddys girls what kind of aditudesbehaviors are they susceptible to that makes certain people dislike them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im like that my dad is great in some ways but he isnt the kind of guy who will have a laugh and some beers or teach me to shave or any stuff like that i get jealous swing people who have that sort of relationship hes a good dad though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a guy i barely heard two words from my father until he retired
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my dad can adopt you hes one of the best human beings i know he farts a lot though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,make sure you are a loving parent be what you wished your dad would have been
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im in canada but what has been the process im and my step dad is my dad i didnt even know this was an option and i think and know he would too it would be awesome to do this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a cardinals fan i too have tears of joy when i think about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats amazing she is very lucky to have you in her life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is somebody cutting onions in here or is it just me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im actually close to both of them after my parents split my stepdad really took on the fatherly role for me and my sisters im lucky to have two awesome dads
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my guess is real dad walked her down the aisle which is why she asked step dad for the first dance
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man i cant keep up with all these internet abbreviations i feel like im having to look at least new ones up per day just to understand what anyones talking about maybe im getting old anyway for those of you like myself ott overthetop i think
UpliftingNews,not_removed,let the tears flow my friend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what have you done i clicked your link and suddenly someone broke into my apartment and started cutting onions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i signed my legal rights to her away so biologically she is my daughter but legally she has no relation to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt try to draw attention away from the happiness between the two in the video the daughter is a grown woman and i am sure she has put alot of thought into what she did and i imagine the feeling of her nowlegal father is nothing but joy and love i wanted to share my story after reading all of the other comments because in the article it stated her biological father refused to give up his rights not all of us that choose to are deadbeats alot of us are very loving and caring but are in terrible relationships with someone we are supposed to coparent with and it was by far the hardest and most painful decision i have ever made in my life but like i said my daughter is happy and healthy and as a biological father thats the best thing i could ever hope for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,east coast australia maybe still pretty early though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yikes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah he had asked my mom for like ten years if he could adopt me and then he didnt ask for a few more years and then i considered it and buh bye lol he just came back into my life recently super awkward
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude he had a family
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no clue never been adopted before or know anyone that has been or has adopted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no that would be stepgranddaughter zing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never thought about it before so yeah sorry for asking i dont live in florida i dont know how those laws work ive never been adopted or adopted anyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you get a lawyer to write up the paperwork set a court date and then you go before a judge get the approval and everyone signs at least that was the process in my state the main difference between adopting an adult and a minor is that you dont need the permission of all current parentsguardians to do it i was in the same boat as the woman in the story my biological father refused to sign the paperwork to allow the adoption so i had to wait until i was old enough to sign on my own behalf that i wanted to be adopted then i was given an adoption certificate that indicating that my legal father was now the man who raised me afterwards i was also able to legally change my name and get a new birth certificate issued with the updated name and father information so i didnt have to provide both forms when filling anything out that required my birth certificate as a form of id
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrnonononoyesnonononononononoyesno edit added one knew i was forgetting it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rmaybemaybemaybe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a thing called multireddit that combines several subreddits into one feed but i cant figure out how to use it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rfiftyfifty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes there is its literally rmaybemaybemaybe a bot grabs all posts from these types of subreddit a and posts them all in that sub
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh do you mean rmaybemaybemaybe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my first reaction oh come on it cant be that bad i click it and this is the first thing i find florida man charged with throwing alligator into wendys damn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rkenm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just within the past couple minutes before clicking into this thread saw a story about a florida man throwing an alligator into a drivethru window they a special kind of weird down there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you always see a florida man was arrested today followed by a fucked up story which is because florida has a unique law regarding the release of arrest records
UpliftingNews,not_removed,our laws allow journalists access to police reports with few restrictions so if its a slow news day youll see a florida manwoman that being said i would never live in north florida or miami give me central florida and the south stopping short of dade county
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the defective florida gene is on the y chromosome so only men are affected
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because guilty before and after proven innocent yay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just moved from there and what i witnessed was a large group of outsiders moving into the state from new england to new york and new jersey you are bound to get a lot of different and unique people there i personally had the time of my life the short time i was there and met some amazing people from all over the planet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont forget to cut a little hair off and glue it to barbies crotch so she now has pubes yes sigh thanks for that one bro
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my brother would have put me in to a submission hold
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i was a kid my brother punched me in the mouth and knocked two of my teeth out hes still my favorite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre not alone i feel the same way you do sometimes its hard to see people revel in things you know youll never get the chance to have and its even worse if they take it for granted most of my regrets are less for things ive done or failed to do and more for opportunities and relationships that never got the chance to be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats how i feel like i was robbed of something that i was cheated out of something it makes me feel bitter on the inside because even if i make the rest of my life awesome time is the one thing you cant get back and ill never be able to redo childhood i deserved a happy childhood and i didnt get it that tiny feeling of emptiness about it is always in me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah the people who are all like childhood is the best time of your life made me neurotic i felt like i was doing it wrong and it was escaping me turns out not my fault shitty environment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same man i see my friends being intimidated by their dad when they fuck up because they respect them so much and it literally doesnt make sense to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just give them your time none of us have much but its as simple as taking your daughter or son on errands with you or letting them push the grocery cart you dont have to buy them ponies or take them on vacation to switzerland just spend time with them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its all about nurturing the love and trust between you and your children your time is the most precious thing and far more important to trinkets my sisters and i are total daddys girls my fondest memories rip daddy revolve around card games with playful insults and threats putzing with him around his garage snuggling on his big belly while watching tv listening to him and his brothers reminisce about their childhoods him struggling to help me with algebra he ended up taking a college course so he could remember how to do it searching for crystals where he grew up and searching for sea shells and star fish at the ocean and a million others none of those memories include me receiving anything but his love and attention when i became an adult we were best friends he was the first one i called when i had a bad day at work so he could talk me down thats what being a daddys girl is all about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if they ask you to hang out do your best never to say no my mom and dad divorced when i was but when i was a kid my dad always gave me his time whether it was going outside into the backyard to play catch after dinner time going into the basement to take hockey shots against me while i played goalie if i ever asked my dad to do any of that stuff he almost never said no even after a long day at work when i know he was probably pretty exhausted calvin and hobbes will always be my favorite comic strip ever and sums up fatherhood at least for me better than any words ever could i dont get to see my dad that often nowadays im and have my own life hes remarried and lives a state away but i will always remember those moments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell them you love them repeat compliment them on all kinds of stuff the more mundane the better spend time with them pepper them with questions about themselves whats the bestworst thing that happened today remind them when they do something bad that you didnt like what they did not who they are you still love them no bearing on what they did try to find something they like and support it collecting pokemon cards buy them a pack out of nowhere for no reason this is all i could think of off the top of my head
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just care care about whats going on in their life show an interest in their interests my dad was always too busy to pay much attention to me growing up and because of that he feels more like a step dad i never got to know than my biological father
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id like to add something to what the other posters have said just for your girls my dad always preferred his sons to his daughters and while its not worth it to be upset so many years later i just wanted to tell you i would have loved to have their relationship with him the kind with camping martial arts classes and engineering projects as much as i tried my father always struggled to relate to me and he still treats me like an other your girls may well grow up to love the outdoors or sports or gaming or robots whatever that their mom doesnt share there are lots of opportunities for dads in particular to shine and i think my dad missed out on an awful lot by not understanding that i wasnt less curious or active than the boys my sistersinlaw had the opposite with their dad they have tons of memories of kayaking hiking barbecuing etc and theyre so grateful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like the others said just spend time with them as a little girl my favorite thing was playing games my mom wouldnt play any with me but my dad was always there to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell hem you love them always dont stop so that it carries on into adulthood i love my dad but its very hard to say it because hes very unemotional ask them questions about their day and dont let them blow it off my year old will just say good unless i ask him more specifically or get him laughing first i like to ask him something silly like hey buddy how was your day you catch anyone picking their nose it always gets a giggle and opens the conversation to anything specific that was good or bad about it like another poster said if they ask you to play sports or colour always try and say yes if you cant tell them you will later but always always do it later if you say you will if theyre interested in typically girly things like dolls play with them they may not realize now but as they get older they will appreciate your interest in their interests let them know you will always be there for them if they need anything im and my dads my go to i know i can count on him for literally anything i never really grew out of the my dads a superhero thing i still believe to this day my dad knows everything hes the smartest person ive ever met
UpliftingNews,not_removed,be the father you wish you had unless your dad was great then do that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,spend time with them respect them take interest in their hobbies when they say something like daddy look at my drawing of a butterfly dont just brush them off like yes yes thats nice and then go on about your day ask them wow whats the butterflys name where is he from and play along as they get older if they mention liking certain movies or music or books ask them whats that about show me your favorite song lend me your favorite book i suffered not because my parents were hateful towards me—but because they justdidntcare i was always child to be seen and not heard and they were always parent and they never wanted to bridge that divide i was lonely they didnt ask my questions about my life or just chat with me just shoot the breeze every conversation was an order a scolding or just emotionless and factual ie if you go to the library fill up your moms car on gas okay will do even to this day when i say hey wanna go see a movie with me wanna go to the store with me you can help me pick some stuff out they shoot me down i dont know if they even know how dismissive they are because i dont think they intend to be cruel but as a result i do a lot of things alone i dont share things with them i feel like i cant talk to them without being lectured even now that im an adult your attention is the best thing you can give them theyll push you away at times such as when theyre moody teenagers but i promise you—no matter how moody and standoffish a teenager is no matter how much they scream leave me alone the ones who know deep down that their parents care and will always be thereare the kids wholl turn out alright and will stop pushing you away earlier just be there for them even for things that you feel you may be too busy or tired for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree with the poster who said just spend your time im about to turn and i still run errands with my dad when i go home and visit my mother wonders why she and i have a piss poor relationship but all of my memories growing up were of my pops and i driving to krogers walmart the pool store the butcher walgreens dropping off mail at the post office and various other small things when youre running errands for hours each saturday thats when i talked to my dad he taught me about cars then i asked questions about things we heard on the radio he told me our family history we stopped and had milkshakes sometimes it was amazing how much time i spent with him just riding around in a car picking up household items and helping with house stuff like the pool or the yard running errands with my dad is something i will cherish forever and something that i hope to pass down to my kids just make them part of your everyday life my dad and i had our special routine which was really me just joining his routine on sundays we would get up early for me have english muffins with peanut butter instead of cereal like during the week and we would read the funnies the comics together he still sends me garfield and dilbert strips in the mail
UpliftingNews,not_removed,father of young girls here im far from a expert but one thing i do is to try to include them in the little things i do need to do an oil change on the car here hold this wrench and let daddy show you how to do this making dinner here help me mix these ingredients running to the store to pick up a few things hop in the car and come with daddy stuff like that i also try to be involved in the things they wantlike to do taking dance classes on saturday morning i try to be there to watch i think its also important to spend time with just you and your kids the local recreation district where we live has a daddydaughter dance around valentines day i took my older daughter last year she was and she is still talking about it months later this year im taking both of them one last ideamy one daughter has tuesday off from kindergarten for some testing thing so i took the day off work and we are going to spend the day together i suggested a bunch of activities and let her decide what we should do as of now its looking like breakfast the park and a museum to be honest my first reaction to having daughters was something like oh crap i have no idea what to do with daughters im far from the perfect parent and i lose my patience more than i should but hopefully these little things will be a positive influence in their lives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not a parent so i cant help from that perspective but im the eldest of four kids with very loving parents and i think my point of view may help tell them you love them affection is so necessary not just as s kid but also when theyre teens they may not show it but man i tear up when my dad says he love me dont have high high expectations sure you can hope theyll do great at acemdia but its not everything i didnt get my fathers brains and struggle at maths and sciences i actually fell into depression because i was too hard on myself i so desperately wanted to make my mother and father proud that they had a smart kid and when my dad realised the extent of the problem he gave me a hug and said hey ana ill always love you no matter what you end up doing in life im so proud of you right now im proud of you from when you was a little babe and im proud of the future you because ana youre hardworking and honest and kind and i dont care what you end up doin for a degree i dont care if you dont want to be a doctor i want you to be happy in life so just know you have your mothers support and mine forever we will always e proud of you hes said this in variations many times and you dont get it or you do but coming from a south asian family where my cousins are doing science degrees and im the only artsy one hearing that i can be different and that theyll be proud regardless i needed to hear those words had a huge impact on me i dont think im ready for uni so im looking at apprenticeships and my parents are supporting me geez typing that out makes me feel shitty for rebelling and dyin my hair pink for the last five months i wanna hug my dad now haha dont do the whole gender roles thing in south asian culture girls cook and boys play is average however my parents grew up here in britain so they are far from that my brother is also learning how to cook he does chores too now this point might not be necessary but keep it on mind for everything i had relatives telling my sister she couldnt play certain sports cause of her gender and my fathers reply bullshit shes kicks a football better than any of the boys in our family dont be hard on yourself i cant chat cause i aint no parnet but i have three younger siblings one turned five recently so ive fed him cared for him when he was a baby so i know from experience that youll blame yourself for everything dont youll make mistakes its what makes us humans show emotion is ok to your boys this shitty society says boys dont cry we know that bullocks dont let them grow up bottling everything up i hope i could be of some use if not then apologies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no one really hates daddys girls just jealous because our dads left usdiedwere distant im a lad anyway so i couldnt be a daddys girl anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the daddys girls i hated were the ones who never learned that their actions have consequences and figure someone else will clean up their own messes for them teach your kids to be considerate and that actions have consequences help them with the fallout obviously but dont do it for them and dont let them off the hook for nothing and your girls will be fucking golden i think to me the daddys girl stigma comes from a lack of independence and maturity just be a good parent and youll be golden too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i replied to another comment that explains why i feel that way sometimes its pure envy and not usually any fault the daddys girl its just hurt and anger at something you never had a say in but whose absence can have a profound negative effect on you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as long as you raise them to be considerate of others and just caring people in general dont worry about them we cant help how other people feel if they are hurting but we can be kind and tolerant i dont think daddys girls are automatically selfish or spoiled the love and attention they receive is more often something that strengthens them and makes it easier for them to have good relationships with all kinds of people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nothing they could do really same with rich kids they can have the best character in the world but theyll never experience the struggle of being poor as daddys girls will never experience shitty dads hopefully so talking with them about it seems kind of pointless and wishing for something one cant have anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jealousy of the bond between the dad and girls others assume that being a daddys girl is being spoiled rotten with things not always true
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a standard dad thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,make your dad eat greek yogurt it did wonders for my farty dog
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a rangers fan wasnt it weird that the mlb canceled the world series we totally should have played each other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this sounds like me im very close with both my dad and step dad same with my mom and step mom divorce has worked out positively for my family i have a boatload of siblings step full half and to us it doesnt matter were still siblings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im very close with my daughter and im a big part of her life it would absolutely crush me if she chose her stepfather over me for something like that like sadness of a magnitude that would cause physical pain especially being surprised by it in front of an audienceeesh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so did your bio dad walk you down the aisle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well it would have been weird for him to do it while they were still together
UpliftingNews,not_removed,butif you miss her that much who gives a fuck just go knock on the door with a gift and politely say you just want ten minutes with her the mother wouldnt give you at least a few minutes a month you dont get along with the mom but is it something where shell call the cops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey man it probably means nothing but the logic soundness and consistency of your decisions is unquestionable the emotional sacrifice total you acted like the really ultimate man i know your hands are tied right now but are you gonna be able to contact her once she becomes an adult please dont leave this inside you forever we as fathers are strong enough to be able to wait but theres a connection that you should try to recover as soon as you are able to i havent felt sad with many threads here in reddit but your story hit close to home i had some enormous differences with my wife early on and i was willing to sacrifice anything for the wellbeing of my daughter so i understand you completely this is extremely heavy please contact her when you are able to legally hope im not talking bullshit i dont know the specific laws of your country neither your whole situation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it seems like you should be able to i mean i dont have my fathers last name i have my moms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no its ok sorry if i came off as rude lol its not just the us though pretty much anywhere you have to adopt your stepchild and not just marry the parent if you want to be their momdad

UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i just saw that after i commented drive by with a alligator sounds about right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,other states dont release arrest records
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah its so weird when you think of florida you think of retirement homes million dollar houses and beautiful beaches and women then you visit somewhere outside these places and you realize florida also means sweltering heat middleschool dropouts trailer parks and catching fish with your dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a central floridian fuck south florida and north florida
UpliftingNews,not_removed,miami and miami beach are my favorite places and ive traveled a lot but yes because of the sever winters lately people are moving south my boyfriend is from philly he followed two cousins here and slowly the rest of the family is trickling down however as a result were starting to get more northern chains like wawa and wegmans so no complaints my dad was from ny thanks for saying nice things about my home
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who do you think punched her in the gut
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah too obvious you have to pluck a few hairs out every time shes not looking eventually shell start to notice and ask why her barbies keep shedding if youre lucky youll be there when she does thats when you tell her shes been playing with them too much and if she wants them to stay pretty she has to leave them alone shell act like she doesnt believe you but just wait eventually youll catch her staring wistfully at all her dolls shell want to play with them but she wont dare take a minute to savor your victory then back out quietly and begin plotting your next con
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my sister is in a similar boat she was always in and out of the hospial as a child and lived with abusive cousins years later after having kids she feels satisfied watching them have a better childhood she would even take the time to watch cartoons and play with them not saying having a kid will solve your problems but to look towards the future instead you cant change your past but you have contol of your present accept the things you cannot change have the courage to change the things you can and have the wisdom to know the difference nora allen the justice league the flashpoint paradox
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right it took me a long time to get out of the habit of basically saying who gives a shit if hes maddisappointed to my friends when they would talk about shit like that because i just didnt get how insensitive that was for me to say to me i thought i was showing solidarity by saying their dads opions didnt matter because mines never have
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agree things have been horrible personally since my break up but the kids dont care girl and boy they look forward to any time with me and that reminds me of why i look forward to our time together even though it reminds me of the time i lost keep them involved and speak to them when they are not just being shts like you would any short person you care about learning from you is more likely to be remembered more than a week at school good luck everyone as the world is becoming a strange place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a new dad to a old girl i wont claim to be an expert but my favorite moments with my girl are just doing the things we have to do in life but doing them with her picking up the laundry going food shopping taking walks so my advice would be to just include them whenever you can

UpliftingNews,not_removed,then be the best auntuncle or be a big brothersister there are kids who are living similar situations that you did and need someone to just give them attention
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel you the future seems very uncurtain right now but you still have the option of volunteering in someone elses life look for a local bg club or an orphanage trust me it makes a huge difference in their lives bigger than you think
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i danced with both of my dads my bio dad also walked me down the aisle and knew about the surprise dance with my stepfather my dad was very happy about it it was a great time all around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think it would be a stretch to assume that it was a surprise only to the stepdad she might have discussed it with her bio dad prior and the bio dad probably got to walk her down the aisle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes he did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have no idea where she is absolutely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for the kind words internet friend i had a hard time struggling with it for awhile but things get better it still is a crap situation but i still have many years to have a reconnection
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jesus christ i thought he was holding a gun at first i quickly backed out and then read another comment and then reluctantly clicked on it again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was nerve racking

UpliftingNews,not_removed,i seriously almost ran away i said oh god out loud twice phew
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so glad i watched that in rnonononoyes this morning before seeing it here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love when humans save animals and they just look around like wait so youre not gonna kill and eat me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,couldnt watch hid behind my cat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shit like this is why i hate people who litter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cut it off before he strikes the first time and it would be the best mildlyinfuriating gif ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,with my cat you only have one chance to break that completely off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can confirm i mean so ive heard not that ive tried of course
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well the constitution gives us the right to bear arms but i prefer something in the lizard family and theyre all animals so its all the same thing right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,from north florida can confirm all of this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not even touching you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow thats devout id just say casually i wonder what barbie would look like with shorter hair maybe someone should give her a haircut oh well and walk out of the room whatever else happens wasnt me i was over at timmys when the hair was cut call his mom if you dont believe me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my sisters just give their own barbies haircuts instead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats the httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiserenityprayer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am the eldest he knew he would be going through this shit again two more times i was pretty good in math so he didnt usually need to help when my youngest sister took the class that college course paid for itself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my pleasure i absolutely adore it i can just imagine his mindset as the strip progresses and i feel like its something all parents struggle with at times
UpliftingNews,not_removed,interestingly enough we live in the most peaceful equal and prosperous time since the dawn of humanity im always surprised people think things are worse off now somehow that being said i admire uhahawoooo for deciding having kids is not for them a lot of people buckle under societal pressure when there is plenty of ways to have a fulfilling and meaningful life without kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like you have great influences from both thats awesome and good on your bio dad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like a winwin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so glad to hear memories for all of you forever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes my bio dad walked me down the aisle i had two separate dances my dad knew i would surprise my stepdad with a special dance it was a very happy and fun wedding full of lots of love
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this might be completely innapropriate but can i suggest something whenever you think about her and have a little bit of time write her a letter and put it in a box you know that at some point in her life she is going to come looking for you and shes probably going to think that you didnt want her even though the real situation is incredibly nuanced and complicated by writing her letters and keeping them if that moment ever comes where she comes looking at least you can give her a bunch of letters that you wrote her while she was growing up that shows how much you missed her thought of her and was proud of her my friend was in a similar situation and when she found her dad after she turned it was hard for her to realise that he did love her just couldnt see her while she was growing up long story thats not worth going into here and tbh i dont have the entire story so dont want to make things up if he turned around and gave her a bunch of letters saying how proud he was of her and showed how much he thought about her it might have smoothed over the long and tumultuous process of them trying to create an adult relationship this whole suggestion might be way out of line and maybe not even a good one but there was something in the way that you wrote that sounded genuine and struck a chord with me so maybe its something to think about doing who knows it might be cathartic or something for you too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jeez man well hope one day youre right and she shows up for you best of luck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im watching youtube right now and as soon as i ready your comment a gun when off it scared me lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had both my arms raised above my head for some reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the interchange at and was shocking to me ive never seen so many homeless people and hitchhikers in my life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all kinds of crazy stories not just crazy homeless people for example the story about the store assistant who keeps getting harassed and arrested for trespassing at work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats true as long as you sleep under a roof the rain here is no joke sometimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes you moooommmmmmmm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,planting the seed you know whats up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,believe it or not we are heading towards extinction at this rate the consequences of climate change are starting to hit us hard in ways we have never imagined and not to mention that tree growth is slowing down the ocean is becoming too acidic for an entire food chain and parasiticagricultral pests are moving north from the tropics having a kid today means you are setting them up for litteral hell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you i do dream of getting a knock on the door opening it and seeing someone there to explain everything to i think about it almost every day and i hope it comes true of course there will be a rocky road to reconnection but i dont think it is impossible i am awfully happy for your friend as well that is beautiful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,legit reaction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats usually during the day rain at night isnt nearly as common during the day youd be up and about and its easy to get under cover somewhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ssssh shhh ill let you hit me back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt realize i was doing so he was the best i couldnt ask for a better father its astounding as he came from an abusive family his father was a terrible drunk some of his brothers followed in his footsteps dad and a couple other brothers there are boys total made the decision to be better people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a long post but i wanted to share my experience with uuxoguy to help provide insight from another perspective upvotes to ujumpinjack frost for this suggestion i am another version of your daughter my parents divorced when i was separated when i was then spent all of their savings on attorneys to argue with each other for another years after that they made regular court visits to argue about custody terms and who didnt follow them and who didnt make me practice the violin enough etc as a rule of thumb anything that required them to have any sort of conversation or interaction at all with each other required a cop or a lawyerjudge during this time as is the norm it seems i lived the majority of the time with my mom thus having plenty of time to become jaded about my dad my mom passed away from breast cancer when i was and i was forced to go live with my dad full time obviously this had disastrous consequences as i never viewed him as an authority figure more of a disneyland dad and generally just had a shitty opinion about him as a person after two years i moved into my maternal grandmothers house until i finished high school and could move out during the time i lived at my grandmothers i did see my dad though the frequency definitely decreased as i got older and my grandma wasnt a huge fan of his either after high school i decided i was old enough that i finally didnt have to talk to my dad anymore that i could just wash my hands of this guy that i thought was a big jerk for the sake of being a jerk and just accepted that i was parentless i mean one year i think i was my dad made a big effort to try and see me on christmas travelling over hours to try and get me to go to dinner with him and i declined every call hoping he would get the idea and just disappear i feel terrible about this now this approach however got very lonely very quickly and i realized that my year self had no idea how to function in the real world and i had no parents to fall back on so i reached out to my dad he could have been bitter and mean and talked so much shit about my moms side of the family and he would have had every right to instead he gave me a box full of greeting cards and asked if i wanted to stay for dinner he didnt try to parent me or say i told you so and at the end of the night he said dont be such a stranger this was fun call me if you need anything the box of greeting cards was filled with birthday cards and valentines day cards and mothers day cards and every other random holiday you can think of and even the just because cards he later told me that every time he thought about me or experienced something he thought i would like he bought me a card and wrote a message in it some of them were oneliners some of them had every empty space filled he told me i didnt know if you would ever come around again but i thought if you did wed have a lot of ground to make up so i thought this would help i went from barely speaking with my dad to hating him and not speaking to him for years to talking to him once a week we definitely dont have a traditional fatherdaughter relationship but im so thankful that he gave me the opportunity to read those cards and understand how he felt when everything was going on from my perspective he didnt want to talk to me either he had a new family a new wife new kids and there wasnt room for me im so glad i was wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i second that write her letters and get your thoughts on paper about giving her up for adoption for her benefit etc and then when she inevitably comes knocking you have that to build off i mean obviously it sounds like a tough situation and im not sure how youd go about it but if you convey that you did what you did to make your daughter happy because it was an untenable situation with your ex wife and her family then thatll mean a lot only difficulty is how to phrase it without completely slating the mum
UpliftingNews,not_removed,punches mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hahahahahahah this legitimately made me laugh out loud as a big brother i remember desperately offering this when i saw my little sibling about to snitch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are a person who is obviously an older sibling the deals i was offered to not tell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont cry dont cry fuck i came to these thread to see puns not cry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck me im crying that is awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you thank you thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we were playing we were playingoh fuck oh fuck stop crying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not sure why the election in the gambia is on there given that the president refused to accept the result
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i came here from rall so i dont know if this gets posted all the time but theres a book called progress by johan norberg about how things are actually getting better all the time in big important ways hes a cool guy id definitely give him a hug if i saw him if it was something he would like and agreed to on his own free will
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there may be a ninth planet lurking in our solar system oh you mean pluto yep its still there no matter why they decided to classify it as something else
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rip harambe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was great i dont know why everyone was whining about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about nasas em drives for the space section that is life changing technology for our species if it becomes possibleviable with more testing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they keep saying that theres peace in colombiaso far i havent see a proper way of measuring that exciting new peace they keep talking aboutall i see is that crime is the same if not highercorruption its at an all time highthe drug production didnt stop it actually went higherohand we are getting our taxes raised from to on february but heyour president got a nobel prize for marketing the word peace so efficientlyhe shouldve won a razzie award because the majority here didnt buy his act and actually voted against itbut heywhats a democracy this day if the congress doesnt just ignores the peoples vote and proceeds with it anyway looks like a great year itll be a fun one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about the meme that saved a man with cancer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the death penalty is illegal in half the world alas clearly not in the us sigh what misery it is that we celebrate the statistics in the rest of world as good news but yet ignore the sanctity of life in the us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,enjoy those rose colored glasses fake news site
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ya i was gonna say voted out a dictator doesnt really make sense voted out with force and threats maybe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,makeplutoplanetagain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wasnt there a ball of ice near pluto that was bigger than pluto i think that was the main reason they ditched pluto as a planet if so we have to melt it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you heard about pluto thats messed up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish i could forgive you for that but i cant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably because we elected one of the most disgusting human beings imaginable to be our president and now the whole world is going to pay for it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know right tf did i do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those are still deep in wildly hypothetical land hyperbolic articles about how its published therefore its real aside if if theres something to them its probably going to be a few more years before people will be able to say anything vaguely certain but at the moment any effects are right on the edge of peoples ability to reliably measure them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as biased as they can be every point they made is fact and has happened in calm down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eris you mean
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just because you guys fucked up doesnt mean the whole year was bad though thats just one albeit very important country among hundreds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we have but one rule dont be a dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i happened to vote for him along with millions of others who happen to be your countrymen the only thing that is disgusting is your divisiveness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more like the best president imaginable was elected to lead america into a brighter future
UpliftingNews,not_removed,americans elected that pos redditors didnt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah good thing we have the electoral college so she didnt actually get in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is months old so it started almost as soon as started
UpliftingNews,not_removed,meme started long before trump won
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive havent seen much about people actually believing it just because there were peer reviewed results most articles and posts i have read understand that it doesnt mean much beyond having a basis as a concept but it is something last i saw nasa was planning on performing experiments up in space whether or not it is substantial output it is still exciting stuff to come out of this year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are multiple posts in this thread pointing out that some of these are in fact not facts why does the fake news moniker trigger you people so much msm is the single biggest fake news outlet in the world having been busted multiple timesoften live on air
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well it would be less than it is right now since more people voted for her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but that doesnt fit with the badgood rightwrong blackwhite divisive thinking that is so profitable to the establishment media and keeps politicians and multinational publically traded corporations in power the fact remains we had two poor choices for president and we need to figure out how to fix this however americans are resilient and we will be just fine over all it was a good year all around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,would you prefer the plague or cancer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trump has already tweeted about america needing more nukes when we already have enough to turn this planet to gravel we are all fucked no matter what corner of the world we live in this is a nightmare for every human being
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the only thing that is disgusting is your divisiveness people dont have to keep quiet about what they perceive to be your bad choices why do you hate freedom also trumps hair fake tan and suits are all disgusting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the only thing that is disgusting is your divisiveness because the rise in radical farright groups who have found encouragement after the election isnt disgusting either
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as opposed to trumps totally not divisive campaign right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no the fact that a billionaire pulled the wool over your eyes and made you think he cared about you by using fear and hate is truly disgusting you people made us all look like garbage and now everyone is going to have to pay for your stupidity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,on point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a few hundred american did electoral college most of us the actual voters didnt by about a million gotta love our pointless election system get out and vote what do you mean your vote actually didnt matter since the electoral college doesnt have to nor did it actually follow what voters wanted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah im mainly referring to press coverage equating published and proven which is a big pet peeve from mine in science journalismsuchasitis circles i think chinas running orbital experiments too im looking forward to hearing what both have to say one way or another given the relative simplicity and the possible outcomes the more the merrier when it comes to taking a good hard look at this one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats you people exactly this is a sub for uplifting news and youre practically asking to start arguments mainly political
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but hillary sent emails that may have been hacked by the russians good thing our polling booths were also hacked by the russians
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is a constructive way to criticize and there is distasteful attacks never said he wasnt allowed to be devisive but it doesnt help us if we were still in the elections id understand his point but its over trump is our pres i learned to accept obama the tolerant liberals need to bite down accept trump and work on winning elections
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you just said my opinion my opinion conjecture opinion im intolerant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tolerance look it up not everyone who disagrees with you is the spawn of satan and hitler the majority of people who voted for trump did so for positive reasons not because they are alt right neo nazis not everyone who votes trump is dumb or uneducated millions and millions of educated hardworking americans voted trump stop dismissing half the country as racist idiots its not accurate and you are spreading misinformation and devisiveness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,last time i checked every presidential campaign in recent history has been devisive trump was playing to win and he won point is the election is over get over it trump made up with his enemies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,question why does it matter that he is a billionare i dont understand how that is a negative thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it sorta seems like you dont really understand why our political system is set up the way it is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,million
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks ofox entertainment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,considering obama had years of hes a kenyan muslim and show us your birth certificate you should be on your knees thanking democrats for being so accepting so quickly at least when trump leaves the swamp overflowing we might have a mandate for actual radical reform
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aaahhgg why do both parties always have the same stupid argument you should get educated and do your research and then youll see how right i am
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i reserve the right to criticize my president elect and of my fellow americans
UpliftingNews,not_removed,educatedsmart people dont accept transparent lies from known liars
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah but one of the rules of reddit is that you have to be antitrump
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they werent claiming that everyone who voted for trump is racist they were pointing out the reality that white supremacy has seen more public attention try actually reading a comment before calling it misinformation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and youre still here making excuses for voting for a narcissist whose last concern is the wellbeing of this country and before you try to swing the hillbot brush my way she deserved to lose as much as trump did they are equally foul people stop trying to play the bipartisan you voted for a bad candidate that was faced with an equally bad candidate you cant stand on the moral high ground here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this guy gets it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not even going to grace your moronic comment with a rational response youre too entrenched in your own im right everyone is wrong i wanna suck ben garrisons balls viewpoint that youre not worth trying to educate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre not particularly good at discussing politics are you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it matters because he has no idea about the hardships you face everyday living from paycheck to paycheck it matters because you dont become a billionaire without owing someone powerful some sort of favor it matters because it gives him a obvious reason to cut taxes for the rich which in turn puts the burden on our shoulders and he has already talked about that with repealing the estate tax which would only help the people who need help least and then he also has hinted at taking away peoples social security after lying about never doing that to us it matters because there has been a class war raging in this country for decades and only one side has been fighting the rich have been ruining our lives for their own profit since bush gave them all those tax breaks which in turn cripple our economy electing a billionaire is basically like expecting the cause of all our problems to fix our problems its batshit crazy and dangerously stupid we just elected a hungry wolf to take care of the hen house
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont understand how that is a negative thing because reddit is largely liberal and largely thinks that money bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres never been a good excuse for why its set up that way in years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,calm down buddy its not everything is about politics and thanks for bringing race into something that has nothing to do with it sorry for triggering you ill leave you to your safe space where you think the entire world revolves around your countrys politics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you guys are doing the exact same thing lol you are no better replace kenyan muslim with russian nazi
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we got the stimulus bill and obamacare passed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt know you were a world renown economist and foreign diplomat forgive me you should run in years since you know so much either that or youre a time traveler have you seen the stock market and consumer confidence since the election so far you seem wrong sorry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the funny thing is most of the time neither side is acting arguing in a remotely educated manner political debate has just been reduced to namecalling and fingerpointing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,should be i dont agree with you but i respect the voice of my fellow americans we are going to kick your butt in years and get our seats back your cops are republicans your teachers are liberals they are both american and both good people respect differences
UpliftingNews,not_removed,percent lol are you nate silver
UpliftingNews,not_removed,doesnt mean you have to be a dramatic bitch about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,enlighten me since when did politicians become known for their honesty the other choice was undoubtedly a liar too so i dont see your point even jill stein is a liar we had a choice of three liars i chose the one i thought was best respect my choice please
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unless its hillary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what are you talking about man like the trump sign on the black burned down church that was burned down and written by a black man i have seen more white supremacy propaganda the past months to try to stop trump you are confusing media propaganda with reality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where is this increase in white supremacy honestly i havent seen anything change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,deep
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i gotta vote for someone man lol i made my choice im not trying to make excuses for anything im telling you to accept my decision as a fellow american
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think anything i could say would appease you unless it was liberal progressive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how many assumptions can you make in one post i respect and undersrand your opinion but realize that is all it is i could hit you with a wall of text with an opposite viewpoint neither of us would be right please message me days into his administration and we will see if your chicken little theories are correct until then stop hating on your fellow americans some of us are intelligent successful republicans and have our own positive reasons for voting for a billionare cheeto
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they will grow out of it a ton of the donald posts are berners coming over i was a liberal when i was in college too voted obama in got an econ degree from usf percent of my professors were socialists ironically they all reaped the benfits of capitalism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think ive ever heard trump called a russian nazi i did hear the nazi stuff on its own a few months before the election but that all got replaced when the democrats started running the sexist angle yeah people name call him but at least the names are based on social concerns racist oligarch etc rather than petty nationalism kenyan muslim etc and the important thing is that the real bullshit republicans threw at obama partisan obstructionism is not possible for democrats to throw at trump
UpliftingNews,not_removed,differences in people and difference is policy is like night and day incorrect policy should never be tolerated respected or accepted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,choice known liar telling obvious transparent lies choice known liar telling plausible potentially true potential lies which is better i respect your choice as much as i respect the choice of a meth addict to fuck themselves up and considerin your choice could drag the rest of us down with you you should be grateful for that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope hers were well crafted lies accepting well crafted lies from known liars is par for the course in politics shit like were gonna build a wall and mexicos gonna pay for it is not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we dont say this anymore on reddit we say that right there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what are you talking about i never claimed that white supremacy was caused by trump or that white supremacists like trump although i do think that is the case white supremacys increased public attention is easily verifiable all youre doing is straw manning me poorly you can take your intellectual dishonesty and your faux unity message back to td where that sort of thing goes unnoticed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i accept your decision and i disagree with it call me stubborn but i voted for jill stein i assume you stand by your decision and disagree with mine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this coming from someone whose only modus operandi is edgy condescension
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for proving my point better than anything i couldve said
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow i wish i knew i was talking to a brick wall before i typed that out i honestly thought you were looking to learn something you didnt know but you are obviously just being ignorant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the nazi thing is absolutely still happening
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about the israel un thing that seems like an obstructionist move obama knows trump will get on his knees for bibi cmon u never heard trump called hitler or a putin puppet get real homie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,showed they were willing to work with him to an extent despite their major differnces
UpliftingNews,not_removed,days not years come see me in days from jan
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you think i agreed with paying back iran i accept that obama was elected and the people chose to elect someone to pay back a country ears later a country that has held hostages mutiple times a nuclear threat and hate our way of life did i agree witt that policy no do i accept it yes now we have trump we have a diplomatic way of voicing our thoughts this time around i won you lost see you in years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for accepting my choice you got some crack
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont even know what your point is anymore man that white supremacy got more attention its because it was a campaign tactic used to hurt trump how can you not see that im glad it got more attention for the record lock those people up but honestly it got more attention because of political strategy which is sad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,white supremacys increased public attention is easily verifiable yes because of all the easily verifiable hoaxes that msm ran with i saw way more violence from the tolerant left than i did from any white supremacists this election cycle httpwwwphillycomphillyblogsrealtimesjerseymanarrestedinpostelectionvandalisminsouthphillyhtmlmobitrue httpwwwclickondetroitcomnewsannarborpolicewomansstoryaboutbeingforcetoremovehijabdidnotoccur there are many more examples its worth providing a counter to the prevailing narrative that theres been a lopsided wave of rightwing or racist violence this year corrections arent front page news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jill stein for some reason supported trump down the sterch and bashed hillary i do not know the true motives of crazy plant lady no opinion of her yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what that youre close minded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you assumed you knew better than me stop assuming repubs are inferior nincompoops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not where i can see it never in the mainstream unlike the birther stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a contentless post
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you cant obstruct someone who isnt president yet like i wrote above i did hear people calling trump a nazi months before the election but not since then and ive not heard anyone call him a putin puppet but even so those insults are at least based on trump policies and real world events rather than the fact he has white skin unlike the birther stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if the policy was incorrect you should have never accepted it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i said meth addict
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stop assuming repubs are inferior nincompoops then stop proving it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great so just because you dont see it in msm it means it doesnt happen right msm went the other way when they couldnt get nazi to stick by calling him a racist bigot and i definitely still hear that in the media a quick google search of donald trump birther shows the last time msm wrote about the topic was september so i guess thats not happening anymore either unfortunately a search for donald trump nazi has articles written about his similarities to nazis much more recently
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre going to get bent out of shape over every ill informed individual calling trump names youre going to have to make it your full time job i dont mean to offend bit its kind of pathetic like when fox news feels the need to criticise attention seeking university students
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont see why prisoners shouldnt have an official library i mean theres the taxpayer argument but filling a library with books is a good way to help stave off boredom and thus reduce restlessness amongst inmates
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when death becomes uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we have but one rule dont be a dick death isnt uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not all taliban are bad taliban
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i liked this bit before people would stop and watch you or whisper and laugh as you passed and now theyre not bothered barclay says
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im still trying to understand the headline mixed race couple priest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its really amazing how the first priest refused to marry them and nobody would give them a place to stay except a prostitute this beautiful couple has endured so much to be together its important that we listen to them and remember their stories
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the best way to stand up to oppression is to live a good life on your own terms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,twentyfive years ago my wifes pastor refused to marry us sure hed take our money for the venue but he refused to marry a white guy and a hispanic woman he said that our marriage would inevitably fail due to our races being incompatible we had justice of the peace officiate and it was fine six months later the pastor was in jail for arson after his wife cheated on him with incompatible people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the teacher sent her home and asked me to keep her home while she had a chance to talk to the school about how god loved all his children jean didnt have problems after that trudy says one of their daughters teachers was a real mvp
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for sharing that beautiful story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its really amazing how the first priest refused to race couple marry celebrates anniversary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a mixed race person this makes me happy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am thank for pioneers who have paved the way for racial equality i am glad that i have not had to grow up in the same racial environment as my parents and grandparents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would like to know this couple happy anniversary and many more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my grandmother and grandfather was a mixed race couple they got married in the my grandmother was an activist and she was politically active up until her death at my grandparents divorced sometime in the my father has volunteered very little information about them but it sounds like they had personality differences that were too much to reconcile with the additional weight of social pressure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all i have to say to that title punctuation is everything took me a while to realize what it meant mixed race couple that a priest refused to marry celebrates their anniversary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,finally some nonpolitically divisive news in this subreddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a great thanks to this couple as theyve helped break barriers that allow me and my wife to enjoy life without worrying about discrimination i cant imagine living without her or being forced to have never met her in the first place years and i still love her more everyday
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my grandad on my moms side was lebanese and the rest of my is mostly white but i inherited a lot of dark features plus hairplus nose i still get annoying comments from white friends that are mediumracist towards middle eastern people because they think its ok since im mostly white like haha remember how youre part brown lol also my grandma on my dads side always tells me to shave before i go on a trip or the people at the airport will think youre a terrorist anyways people are still annoying about mixed backgrounds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they did it before it was cool good for them heres to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sad some individuals just do not like racial equality still
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as someone who is part of a mixed race couple i am so thankful to people like trudy and barclay who paved the way for us to be allowed to get married
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im blackwhite been with my beautiful and crazy puerto rican queen for years now our children are doomed to have curly hair mwuhaha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aw what a sweet old couple i love stories like this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck your title bro
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not crying youre crying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in one more generation there will be stories and movies like this about gay couples
UpliftingNews,not_removed,noice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably a good story but an unreadable title
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jesus this could use some commas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre adorable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god bless this couplethey look cute in this pic happy anniversary to them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fact once you go black even after years you just factually dont go back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my girlfriend and i are a mixed couple she is black and im white and we got a lot of looks when we first started dating and now no one even sees our skin color anymore they just see a cute couple so i thank these for that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was a remarkably heartwarming article even putting aside all the special problems they had to deal with as an interracial couple at the time it was just nice to read about a couple that have had such a strong and loving marriage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a mixed race couple that a priest had refused to marry celebrates years together
UpliftingNews,not_removed,white genocide isnt real and race mixing isnt a problem racists and ethnonationalists can eat shit and die
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wonderful story but damn british articles are impossible to follow everything is so disjointed get an editor stat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought this said mixed race couple priest refused to marry celebrities even if theyre mixed race
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like the adversity may have made their relationship stronger love is funny in that way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,crazy the stuff theyve seen in their lifetime thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea had to read that title a few times
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was disowned by my mothers side of the family for dating a black man we have a child now and are still together i havent seen my mothers side of the family in over two years i live in kentucky in a city and we dont get bother here but i know we wouldnt be safe living in my hometown
UpliftingNews,not_removed,op here with a sincere apology to those of you ive caused grammatical confusion with my poorly worded title the wording might have worked with a bit of punctuation but probably needs rewriting sadly im newish to this posting game and it seems certainly on the app i use to be impossible to edit it now im blaming something in my eye when i was writing it hopefully the sharing of a lovely story compensates for it heres to their
UpliftingNews,not_removed,black dont crack he looks like he could be in his but is in his
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is always the religious that have the most hatred within them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read that as mixed race couple priests refused to marry celebrates anniversary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,amazing story sprinters dont normally get along well with marathon runners
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i need more news like this in my life such strong and beautiful individuals who were ahead of their time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i watched the original look whose coming to dinner i thought during that time it was a problem for them patience and years begins the change where it is no longer an issue when that movie was filmed the couple would not have known the future
UpliftingNews,not_removed,happy anniversary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the husband looks like a kindly turtle man how wonderful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yall need a comma in that title
UpliftingNews,not_removed,meanwhile all the other couples he helped marry are probs divorced or dead at this point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im still trying to understand the headline i just see two old humansis the priest of a different race
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its wonderful couples like those two that help things change for the better my grandfather was born in the late and my grandmother early hes puerto rican and she is irish and german i know her family wasnt happy about the union but his family came over all the time my mom has the features from her dad but the skin color of her mom my grandparents on my dads side didnt like that she was mixed and i grew up as a black sheep in that family even though both her and i had the same skin color as them fast forward now and my younger brother and i are in mixed race relationships i ended up cutting ties completely with my dads family after their racist remarks were the final straw with my issues with them its been almost years since ive spoken to them my so and i got a little bit of backlash from his family since they initially wanted him with an indian woman theyve been very supportive going forward and are just glad were happy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,english is not my first language so i always had problem with mixed race like half schnauzer half airedale halfelf arent there better words for that this is confusing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,use more commas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the guy looks like tracy morgan in makeup
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like how after the teacher talks about how god loves all his children the girls stops getting bullied nowadays you would get fired and there would be lawsuits involved even though its really not that horrible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you mean interracial couple not mixed race couple surely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,regarding the priest he said theres so many coloured men coming over here and going back home leaving the women with children so im not marrying you we were upset about that says trudy he was concerned about whether shed be divorced and made into a single mother as apparently was happening at that time due to the war he didnt say it was because they were different races
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am astounded that to this day people still dont understand that you dont need a priest to get married state officials like county clerks can register a marriage and in canada for example you can get married in the nearest courtroom or city hall its really unnecessary to make a headline every time a priest speaks out against same sex or mixed race or transvestite marriage sure its inappropriate but the sooner we stop paying attention to their puny capricious ways the sooner they realize its useless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man those dentures
UpliftingNews,not_removed,statistically they had the very highest chance to get a divorce so i guess thats something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gotta throw race in there its important just cram it in mexican anywhere and asian youll do just fine in america black
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats so sweet theyve been thru so much together
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was born in the early crazy to think that about years ago i would have been targeted or looked down upon because i am in love with a man who is of a different race than me it really hasnt been much time and it makes me curious if the same will eventually apply with gay marriage in another years or so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this makes me realize we live in such a better world right now even if it may not feel like it all the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people still do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mixed race couple that priest refused to marry or a mixed race couple which a priest refused to marry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actual article title mixedrace couple the priest refused to marry us looks like op accidently a word when they made a new title
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that my friend is called rtitlegore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the title annoyed me quite a bit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think a priest refused to get them married
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea its pretty hard to understand sentences when you only read half of them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is this a jojo reference
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this it was so poorly worded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except you did understand it and are just being nitpicky
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mixed priest who refused to marry rapes couple on anniversary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this should be a movie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the landlady had lodgers in but she took us in anyway and gave us her big front room trudy says she was a prostitute herself but what a good woman she was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats really weird is that priest was way out of line there never was a restriction on interracial marriages in catholicism and the priest has no right to deny someone a sacrament unless they dont meet the requirements had they found a sympathetic bishoparchibishop possibly unlikely they couldve had him censured more httpsenwikipediaorgwikijamescoyle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except a prostitute mary magdalene
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is it amazing he said theres so many coloured men coming over here and going back home leaving the women with children so im not marrying you we were upset about that says trudy he was concerned about whether the woman would be divorced and made into a single mother not that the man was black
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my mother told me i could date anyone as long as hes white my daughter is married to a black man and my mother loves them both so much they have a beautiful baby boy and hes the delight of the family i asked her why it was okay for her and not for me she said that her father my grandfather would have had issue with it but hes dead now so its okay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this my parents were an interracial couple and they didnt give a damn what anyone thought they were happy and created a life that they could be proud of lucky for them their parents didnt seem to care it was more or less extended family and strangers on the street shocking to me that this was the i always am shocked to find out that racism and prejudice wasnt too long ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good living is its own revenge
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that went from sad to wtf
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a hispanic gal married to a white guy that really hit me i cant imagine having to go through that someone telling you that youre incompatible just becuase of your race im glad things worked out for you guys we never had any disapproving comments fortunately and my family is completely supportive i think they even forget that we are a different race sometimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think im having a stroke
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is it amazing he said theres so many coloured men coming over here and going back home leaving the women with children so im not marrying you we were upset about that says trudy he was concerned about whether shed be divorced and made into a single mother as apparently was happening at that time he didnt say it was because they were different races
UpliftingNews,not_removed,me too and i thought my parents were brave for doing this in the this couple must have experienced things i cant even imagine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,years ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont worry itll show up on here soon enough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,beautiful curls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i still have no idea what happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for translating
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is race replacement via forced diversity policy also race mixing for whites means your babies will look adopted i always laugh at single white women pushing around adopted looking children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i totally thought they were a mixed race husband and wife priest duo and i was like damn thats crazy but still its a beautiful story even if they arent both priests
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was his point if you read the article the men were going home and abandoning their wives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shut the fuck up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was clever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just got uplifted about inches higher
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow im not going to lie i lmfao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and yet look whos happier with their life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a loving couple that stood the test of time and who could teach us all a little bit about love and respect is degenerate edgy teenagers shoul not be allowed on the internet i blame internet ignorant parents for not using parental control why bother educate your kid when he can go on and become an actual overweight angry basement dwelling neet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a cunt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these are not the convictions youre looking for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so hes a piece of shit but at least hes dedicated to being a piece of shit i dunno man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he specified he felt the issue would only arise because the man was coloured not just due to the war
UpliftingNews,not_removed,triggered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obvious troll is obvious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is only one photo of her when she was young its grainy shes not wearing a style which is considered attractive now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok let me inject a little depressing realism here this is rupliftingnews not rdepressingrealism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they were fully aware and did get married by the state plus this was in the the pope sent them personal congratulations when they celebrated their wedding anniversary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you read the article they got married back in the she wanted to have a wedding at a catholic church when the priest refused they instead went to the register office the whole article is about how much they love each other and how much times have changed it think it is necessary that we publicize discrimination people who dont have to deal with it often can forget that it happens i can understand that less media attention might be better but all out ignoring it can also lead to problems
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the thing with mixed race marriage is the church was never against it so it really is the priests personal fault and some religious people want to be religiously married before they start living together and having children so they need a priest to marry them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those arent dentures they dont make dentures without molars and an inch of receding gumline the woman is give her a fucking break
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how does it feel knowing youll never be loved by a woman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope so im always on the defensive because people laugh or give ugly looks when i hold my boyfriends hand at the mall i know its getting better but its still an ugly feeling
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i remeber i had a teacher about years ago that was a black woman married to a white man she had an adorable framed photo of them on her desk nobody in my class ever brought it up i dont think we kids noticed or cared but we once had an old white substitue teacher that saw the photo and spent a little bit of class time going on about how wrong and disgusting that was i remember being really confused and seeing the teacher break down the next day when some kids told her what happened shits fucked up man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dunno if someone else mentioned and it may seem pedantic but if its a man youre in love with then they are of the same race human skin pigment eye shape and hair colour have nothing to do with race were all human
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we were lucky enough to grow up when there wasnt as much bigotry and racism and society for the most part accepts one another and is more open
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same here interracial couple born and in the midwest to top it off i have been amazed at just how little flack weve gotten nearly all of it has been from family and even that was mild and dissipated quickly its given me a lot of hope
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most likely yes the naysayers always have the same fears they try to sell to us back when things were about to change in the us for the lgbt folk i heard many painting pictures of how our society will totally fall in couple of years look at europe the dutch have had gay marriage since like forever theyre happy as a clam god didnt smite them down or shit like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought of this few days ago there was documentary or something similar about old and young gay couples experiences throught the years since the same sex marriage was just made possible here its kinda hot topic right now and older couple mentioned that still people cover their kids eyes or look really badly at them its really sad but what amazes me is that many of these same people who look down to normal gay couples and cover their kids eyes from this agree that tove jansson is one of the most loved and appreciated childrens writer here in finland if you dont know her lifelong partner was tuulikki pietilä a woman double standards i guess who knows
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bullies laugh at people to cast them down or humiliate them im not sure why thats so strange to you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a mixed race couple whom a priest refused to get married to thats understandable since hes celibate and polygamy is forbidden
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how are they married if the priest refused to marry them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah op messed up he was typing in a dusty room and had something in his eye they arent even celebrating their anniversary that was years ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually headline writing style wouldnt include a that between couple and priest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,accidentally a word
UpliftingNews,not_removed,virgin mary celebrates anniversary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a married priest refused to race them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eventually understood it it took longer than it should have
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree id watch it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a united kingdom is a british biographical romantic drama film the film is based on a true story seretse khama david oyelowo is the prince of bechuanaland now botswana in he meets and falls in love with london office worker ruth williams rosamund pike but their interracial relationship is not approved of by either of their families nor by the british and south african governments seretse and ruth must defy family apartheid and the british empire to return from an imposed exile to their african kingdom and assume power after independence close enough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you read the article it was a bit more nuanced than that its clear he thought he was protecting her from abandonment based on similar cases its all easy in hindsight
UpliftingNews,not_removed,priests traditionally have a fatherly responsibility and thus are discouraged from marrying couples where a spouse would end up in disaster similarly even your boss or military commander might have had a say some decades ago remember that marriage used to be for life you can condemn this attitude today but the intentions were not what this thread likes them to be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was concerned about whether the woman would be divorced and made into a single mother not that the man was black of course it was because he was black the single mother response was entirely motivated by race im glad the priest that married them was more openminded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pfft yeah totally not a racist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hate to say it but social progress happens one funeral at a time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im glad to hear that your daughter feels comfortable in dating whoever she pleases this shows that you have helped instill in her the idea that everyone is human and those who have a different skin color should not be seen as different or strange im delighted to hear about your grandchild
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like your mom should have told her father to go fuck himself my dad got to hear that from me when he was drinking heavily to anyone else reading this if there is wrong being done speak up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,teaching children that racism crap should be considered child abuse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not to burst your bubble but racism and prejudice are still quite abundant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always am shocked to find out that racism and prejudice wasnt too long ago or now depending on where you live
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i recommend rsubredditsimulator if you want to have yourself anothed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres so many coloured men coming over here it implies he would have married them if he wasnt coloured
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh my thats gonna break the grammarz
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some say he still has no idea to this day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what the fuck is wrong with you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is race replacement via forced diversity policy white people arent dying out sorry to burst your bubble also race mixing for whites means your babies will look adopted no theyll look half like you and half like the person you had the baby with and whats wrong with adoption anyway you racist fuck i always laugh at single white women pushing around adopted looking children i laugh at racist shit stains like yourself of course youre an rthedonald user why am i not surprised
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe if i wrote that joke in caps you wouldnt have got triggered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you people in this sub are the biggest shutin fruits its painful to look at the comment section if its not a bullshit feelgood message then the stick up your ass takes a degree turn the majority of you have the personality type to hate what i say enough to downvote but too much anxiety for a decent rebuttal that should be expected though dealing with people who rely on a strangers story posted on reddit for moral support
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not what i said what i said was that he has convictions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think rather it was an incidental adjective not an essential one the point of the entire thing clearly i think is that they were abandoning the wives after marriage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im talking about the pic from when she was young
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it has nothing to do with how she is dressed bro
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course i read the article and thats exactly why i felt compelled to point it out these people did the right thing and so many people nowadays dont seem to catch on yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im very surprised that this was a catholic priest the church has never taught against miscegenation note that french and spanish colonials did not have nearly the same qualms about it as english colonials and in the united states there was even a priest martyred by a klansman for performing an interracial marriage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sometimes when i see a cute couple who just happen to be two different races ill watch them and think what a cute couple look how happy they are then one of them will catch me looking and i sometimes wonder if they think im being disapproving then i get sad that i inadvertently caused someone to feel like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just know that while it might suck balls for you two right now you are suffering so that future generations wont have to someday soon gay marriage will just be marriage just like this marriage used to be interracial marriage and that will be because of you i know you didnt ask for this and you shouldnt have to deal with it but its not for nothing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always give them a thumbs up yeah i know its corny as hell and my son said that gesture is stupid but i always look at the woman and thumbs up to couple hell there is someone for everyone i hope im lucky to hold hands with someone in public
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it can be downright dangerous in many areas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel a little bad now whenever i see a gay couple especially men together outside holding hands i feel so proud and glad for them so i give a little triumphant chuckle like a yea you show em i hope couples didnt see me and think i was laughing at them because i was truly laughing with the if that makes any sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,username doesnt check out c
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well tbh interracial and homosexual are not the same
UpliftingNews,not_removed,race may not be biologically real but it is socially real just because race is a social construct doesnt make it not real ones perceived race has real effects on one life and is therefore real unfortunately maybe someday race will cease having social meaning but for now it is what it is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,welllthe were pretty badass legends of the hidden temple was lit as fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres no need to be jealous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you really think it brings you happiness to shit on on other peoples happiness in the uplifting news subreddit at that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lmao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a couple one of which was of a different ethnic descent than the other for whom a priest refused to perform a ceremony in which he bound them together in a marriage both religiously and legally have recently celebrated the anniversary that marks seven decades of having been married
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whomststved
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tbh thats immediately how my mind parsed that headline til i realized i was being just a little silly for thinking so that being the priest was of the couple stringing her along for years because ya know imapriest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe other priests exist or is that silly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,married outside of a church they eventually got a second wedding done by a priest years later
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just because they couldnt get married to a priest doesnt mean they couldnt marry each other the priest just didnt want to be married to them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they married in a courthouse you dont need a priest just an officiant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your headline was fine you would never put that in a headline
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in years theyll be the same colour of dust
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whoosh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id feel obligated to give it best picture
UpliftingNews,not_removed,doesnt make it valid but either way under catholic canon law the only thing regulating catholic marriages he didnt have the legal prerogative to deny the marriage its not his choice regardless of his reasoning interracial couples have never been denied marriage rights in catholicism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,catholic marriage is still for life although i absolutely dont believe that the priest was at all in the right im only talking about his canonical church law obligations discouragement is different from outright denial can § in a special case the local ordinary can prohibit marriage for his own subjects residing anywhere and for all actually present in his own territory but only for a time for a grave cause and for as long as the cause continues ive seen black guys skip town on their wives is in no way a grave cause and would never be acceptable a grave cause for an otherwise valid marriage would be consanguinity a belief that the individuals are unready for marriage although thats rarely invoked and only in the most severe of circumstances not this or obstinate mortal sin on one or both partners known to the priest mostly this would be either a continued state of both cohabitation or premarital sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think rather it was an incidental adjective not an essential one the point of the entire thing clearly i think is that they were abandoning the wives after marriage if it was because he was black he would have said that without all the rest of that quotation that shows it was about their leaving the country not their skin color
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is probably one of the greatest things ive ever read so blunt yet poetic plus it couldnt be more accurate im taking this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems like all progress happens one funeral at a time we cant get our governments to give a shit about the environment or a number of other issues that arent social i guess itll get better as the people in charge continue to die off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you i really appreciate you saying that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my grandfather was not a nice man to put things in perspective he would be if he was still alive the world was very different unfortunately im very glad that my mother didnt agree with her father she raised her kids differently
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think rather it was an incidental adjective not an essential one the point of the entire thing clearly i think is that they were abandoning the wives after marriage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nothing at all but i do love a good laugh at marxist race mixers no matter what their colour
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shut in fruit lol i thought it was funny relax its not even negative its a big dick joke you know not all of us find the same things funny you probably hated the movie this is the end edit i think you think i was disagreeing with the humour of your joke now that i look back at the thread i thought it was funny pal ill accept an apology for calling me a fruit at any time 😂
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they being coloured men not just men in general
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course it does her hair style is also a factor if mens styles had been drastically different back then her husband mightve seemed less attractive also
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pope francis and no this isnt some sort of omg hes so progressive thing any other pope wouldve granted it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honestly when you see it enough you can usually tell the differencenes in how people look at you because people arent that great at hiding their emotions lol i doubt you bothered anyone tho
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when that happens a couple sees me watching them i put my hand over my heart and smile because i dont ever look down on anyone who is in love and dont want them to think that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel the same but more often about gay couples since i mostly hang out with in expat circles in the netherlands where interracial couples are so common that it doesnt even register like its still conceivable that i accidentally look disapproving but that doesnt even cross my mind maybe this feeling is transitional where interracial couples in your case and gay couples in mine are normal enough that you treat them like any other couple but still uncommon enough that you note it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just smile when they catch you looking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this i feel that any reaction would be perceived as negative
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this happens to me all the time i am gay and i love to watch gay couples then again what if they think i am judging its so annoying because if there was never hatred towards anyone we would be able to watch and love more easily without the possibility of thinking that they think its hatred
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats sweet gonna save it for the bad days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean of course theyre different things but the dirty looks are the same
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the players are different but the story is the same hate is hate period
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so correct people every opportunity you get we are one race the human race neither skin nor hair colour are determinants
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is enjoyable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,priest refused to marry this mixed race couple you wont believe what happened next
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whomdvestlldntre
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most of them are homos they become priests because historically it was the only way to avoid getting married without raising alarms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he totally that one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but only for two minutes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a priest is under no obligation to marry anyone its up to him if he has doubts about the marriage hes fully entitled to deny it and they are free to ask another priest also were placing an awful lot of faith in a throwaway remark relating to years ago we dont really know what happened or was said or the context
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one cause why marriage was often denied afaik was that the mans income was too low to sustain a family by canon law this might not be a grave cause but it was obviously viewed like one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah imma have to steal it too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminds me of this a scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it max planck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is race mixing marxist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im going to marry a black woman just so i can have beautiful mixed babies and contribute to white genocide some more and what the fuck does being a marxist have to do with not being a racist piece of shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your post looks like sarcasm i figured you were one of these softies that downvoted it i dont apologize
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then why did you say who cares about looks when youre old and your ass drags on the floor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i know what the bad looks like a crazy woman once yelled at my wife on the corner of and in nyc that she was stealing all the good white men and fuck you chinky bitch yeah there are some winners out there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for this great advice going to try it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im dutch and in my experience gay couples are more common than interracial couples then again i dont live in a city nor do i hang out in expat circles
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey its me ur priest i wont marry you fast forward years still a happy couple
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe ditch the derogatory sounding homos and youve got a comment with merit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i also had john
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had a john
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no johns
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can § in a special case the local ordinary can prohibit marriage for his own subjects residing anywhere and for all actually present in his own territory but only for a time for a grave cause and for as long as the cause continues ive seen black guys skip town on their wives is in no way a grave cause and would never be acceptable edit a grave cause for an otherwise valid marriage would be consanguinity a belief that the individuals are unready for marriage although thats rarely invoked or obstinate mortal sin on one or both partners known to the priest mostly this would be either a continued state of both cohabitation or premarital sex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,check the edit on that comment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its within the doctrine to blend all ethnicities into one or for now convince white people to do it cultural marxists think it will somehow get rid of racism when it will more than likely make things worse and create new groups to be racist towards anyway have fun being triggered ill watch you die out from a distance d
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im going to marry a black woman just so i can have beautiful mixed babies and contribute to white genocide som go for it im not white so i dont have to worry about it d also being a marxist is worse than being a racist plus doing interracial doesnt make you a nonracist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you would be incorrect i thought it was funny and i upvoted you but now i think youre kind of a dick whos ego is too big to accept when he was wrong poor guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you didnt say anything but i was anticipating someone bringing it up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did it work did you leave your wife for the crazy woman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i definitely think its an amsterdamexpat thing none of the dutch people i know are in interracial relationships but around half of the expats i know are including myself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now theyre all making a reality show together
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no dice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no johns youre the johns
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can § you are making some legal argument from canon law which you can if you like im speaking about the real world where life is a bit different in no way can you force a priest to do whatever you want he has a lot of personal discretion over what he does and doesnt do regardless of any text you can quote and in fact the text you quote is clearly not relevant here im fairly sure you have misunderstood it its about banning one of his parishioners from getting married anywhere this was one priests personal decision they were free to go elsewhere and lest anyone misunderstand im an atheist in a mixed race relationship
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it actually sounds more like youre triggered lmao i only asked a question and it got you a little asshurt and you started projecting im biracial sooooooo ill just continue being a product of cultural marxism and other fun racist psychobabble fuck you buddy ❤
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also being a marxist is worse than being a racist wrong
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am a dick its my shtick no apologies no love for anyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and that is how i met your mother
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im in a relationship with an australian girl but were both white so its not really a thing i guess amsterdam is very different from the rest of the country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes i am my whole post that you chose to comment on was about legal arguments from canon law
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if not being a racist shit stain is marxist then im a damn proud marxist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can respect that actually im very similar haha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know the code of canon law would have applied not the code in any event tametsi and ne temere would have applied if the guy didnt know tametsi was superceded by ne temere in any event back then they could have always appealed to the bishop they were married by another priest anyway a sanatio in radice would apply and their marriage would have been considered valid from the time of the civil wedding boom i passed that course at university
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know but i was and am fairly certain my logic is still supported by the canon why do you think tametsina temere would matter tamesti only made it so a priest plus witnesses would have to be present and actually says that parental consent is not required clandestinity refers to the exchanging of vows outside of the eyes of a priest not a hidden ceremony performed in a canonically valid manner by a priest but hidden from society na temere is mainly pardon the pun clerical stuff about how many priests need be there as well as emphatically stating doctrine on natural marriages as well as some legal questions re divorce youre right on srd which somewhat touches on the matter of clandestinity in a post tamesti world but im not sure why clandestiny would matter in this case and i havent even taken a class p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great work i love these humans
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks obama
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre gonna have to thank trump now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who do you think put that mud in there in the first place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,vice is such garbage but i actually liked this video
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rpupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love cnada so much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats pretty cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you use this postal code it will automatically be received by volunteers at canada post sites that will answer the letters its been a while like this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why is this uplifting why do these actresses need a raise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one could argue that they were very well paid to begin with if i was one of these actresses i would be seriously embarrassed to take such unneeded charity and refuse it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we talk about the and ceos making excessive salaries but we never question this type of income for athletes or actors are any of the crew of bbt so phenomenal that they could make it on their own somewhere else
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they should unionize and collectively work together to get the money they deserve just as all workers should the cast the crew and all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the uplifting part is the other actors accepting pay cuts to help out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess lower known female actresses deserve the same pay as established popular actors and actresses i deno i guess i should raise my intern to my managing salary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well mayim bialik is actually a neuroscientist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you take that rational logic of yours and you get out unions are bad and you should feel bad at least in the the united states of freedom hyperbole intended
UpliftingNews,not_removed,out of all the actorsactress on the set mayim bialik probably has the longest established career
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shes not making hundreds of thousands of dollars for every episode of being a neuroscientist though is she im talking about the income
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what the fuck is wrong with these monkeys today i blame video games
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not remotely close to the same situation was a female gorilla was a male silverback gorilla male silverback gorillas can crush a coconut with his bare hand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh you never know a quick death may be better than life in prison idk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i saw bits of video from this last instance and that gorilla was dragging the kid by the leg through water like a rag doll or a piece of meat it didnt seem all that empathetic towards the kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ditto you see pictures posted of a gorilla standing next to the kid and hear they shot him and wonder why then you see the video and think that kid is a goner for sure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,try telling that to the eco freaks and misanthropes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as someone that loves national parks i never considered the fees as a negative thing i happily pay it and will just give it as a donation instead parks cost a lot and should burden those of us that use them more than those of us that dont
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is fantastic though ive never really had a problem with the they charge for a seasons pass just curious if anyone knows how they will continue to operate efficiently without the revenue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love birthdays
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we have this in scotland and basically have since i can remember they have huge boxes where you can still donate as much as you want to the museum or whatever to help keep it going
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the federal government is making up the difference in their budget this year to cover their loss in admissions revenue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure do theyll raise our federal taxes in some other area the taxes they will make off weed once its legalized
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think so i believe it is for canada citizens only
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awesome as someone whos lived in yorkshire all my life its a beautiful county and a much welcomed move those in the newly designated areas should see a healthy bump in their property values too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was not uplifting at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i was in primary school they had a similar thing a kid would stand in the corner of the playground wearing high visibility clothes and if someone had no one to play with they would go and play with high viz kid i dont remember anyone ever going up to high vis kid though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stranger can i sit with you teen no i am busy working on my app
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great so lonely people can now be rejected over an app too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the only reason no one else ever tried to make this before is common sense as normal people will instantly realize using this app will make you the ultimate outsider and label you immediately the loner app will label you instantly in your social environment good job clearly identifying the bully targets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,still not able to convince the cool kids to download the app still sitting alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is rare rupliftingnews and rnottheonion crossover territory
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a cute idea if kids who didnt socialize well were you know social when i was in high school lunch was time for sweet solitude fuck friends i wanted alone time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ya this wont backfire on a kid using it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man lunch was one of the few times i could actually be left alone i just wanted to read my book or work on my language learning and not be fucking bothered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lunch is like minutes in most schools you wouldnt even have time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean these are high schoolers were talking about this isnt going to work its just going to point out easy bullying targets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,teen downloads the app to see who to make fun of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not sure if fake friends count kids at school are just gonna start making fun of anyone who uses it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know theres a lot of pressure for feelgood stories about young adults making apps to help others out of the goodness of their hearts but this seems slightly ridiculous if people want to sit with other people then go sit with them does every social interaction now have to be initiated by an app i dont buy in to the hype that kids now are losing crucial social skills but this isnt helping the cause
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cringey af nobody will use it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am just outraged this kind of stuff happens in high school in switzerland that just doesnt happen ever in the equivalent of high school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aw man only high schoolers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not to be confused with the sit on itapp
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive become so cynical i feel this will backfire on anyone taking advantage of this kids can be super evil
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eating alone in my high school was pretty much impossible the lunch rooms were always jampacked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its like home delivery for bullies great idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is anyone else wondering how the fuck this app is so well polished the ui looks like something built by a full team of experienced programmers and graphic designers im not totally sure how well it actually works but the fact that it looks this good makes for a pretty spectacular addition to any college resume
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she created the app by herself thats impressive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,would like to know more about her training and what she used to program the app i want technical deets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really dislike the use of invent in situations like this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i went took a high school that none of my middle school kids went to i went in freshman year knowing nobody you know what i did i joined campus ministry and volunteered to help build a set for the upcoming play join shit sports clubs extra curricular how about talk to your neighbor student in class before the bell nope lets rely on an app to do the work for you the future
UpliftingNews,not_removed,breaking another teen invents leave me alone app so high schoolers will leave them alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im going to use this app to get whiteboys to sit in the middle of my aĺl black ghetto squad wooo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the bullies will download and use it to their nasty little advantage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow a lot of fucking cynicism in this thread also a lot of lol just go sit with ppl i think the idea here was that a lot of kids maybe arent confident enough to just approach a group in that manner and the app acts as an icebreaker
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they should make a dont sit near me app or a leave me the fuck alone app or an i hate everyone dont come near me app id buy the fuck out of that hell id pay for micro transactions to notify people around me how much i hate them all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this thread is a microcosm of the circle jerk that is reddit half the posters giving really bad advice on how to act as a teenager and the other half trying to mock the work of someone who actually went and did something rather than just posting on reddit all day its like thedonald is starting to spill over in to upliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i made an app called shit with us so that no elderly person has to worry about changing their colostomy bag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can see it working well for a college campus get a bunch of people to sit with and eat lunch together but not entirely sure for a high school setting high schoolers are pretty brutal and will probably judge you for using an app to find friends besides how large are high schools anyway in australia pretty much everyone knows each other if youre in the same grade at school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,teen invents depressing app meet friends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a great idea we have done it in foreign countriesand occasionally in america always interesting conversations we have distinct ny accents and they love to hear us tawk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unless youre too poor to own a phone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah lets keep building safety pads for kids so that they dont ever have to experience what real life might be like a develop some sort of copinglife skills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is probably the best app created for jr high and high school students good for her she is going places
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youll just get bullied for using an app
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this app sounds really stupid and this is coming from a guy who frequently sits alone i dont go up to random strangers and join in their conversations its creepy when i do it and creepy when people do it to me i prefer formal introductions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im nearly positive that adults have downloaded this app to find lonely socially outcast teens with the hopes of becoming their friends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont want to piss on uplifting news but ill try anyway so this attractive yo teenager meaning im not too sure how much bullying she would receive apparently made an app on ios not just my first app no she made a professional app with professional imagery and design there very likely is a or various server behind it that had to be setup maintained and paid ios accounts must be paid etc my point is apps like this are from professional companies they require investments time money and dedication from multiple professionals apps like this are like facebook its not there principally yo help you its there to make money somehow then there is the issue that ios phones are usually de the expensive design phones that youd only find with the rich and popular kids the normies will have poor androids but hey those arent supported so this software development company developed and app to help bullied kids but for some reason made sure that only the rich and popular kids can use it then they use a fairly attractive yo with a sad sob story as a figure head to sell it im not too sure that this is uplifting news or just some type of attempt at viral advertisement for an app that probably no teenager would ever use unless schools would force it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes technology will save us but a nice gesture
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is good a idea yeah but i wouldnt use it cause if someones on their own there could be good reason in that they could be very uncomfortable person to be around and would turn other people off their food source i have my bad days were im very uncomfortable to be around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hmph a rather blatant ripoff of the ancient roman app defeca nobiscum
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now the bullies will ask you to sit with them on the app and punch you in the head as soon as you do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how about the go fuck yourself app
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not saying the app is not helpful and is nice to sit with people during lunch but i feel one should also learn to be alone in public and be confident about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are plenty of high schools out there where youre more likely to get in trouble for playing on your phone at lunch than you would be for bullying this app is a cool idea but i dont think id want to top off a long morning of being bullied with having my phone confiscated and being scolded by a lunch monitor who knows what i could be doing on that phone probably cyber bullying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so i can find a table to sit at so i have people that will stare at their phones with me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a really nice idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now you can be invited to a table via app amd then be ridiculed invitational bullying begins
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh man hit me right in the feels this one the memories of me actually skipping school meals just so i wont have to be seen eating alone are still fresh in my mind sometimes i might be able to muster the courage to find somme quiet spot on the grounds but in general it only made my social anxiety worse i already had the difficulty of eating in public not just school but you know how in school theres a much higher form of pressure as compared to eating at a restaurant or a cafe where you barely know anyone or anyone barely knows you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this idea is so plain simple i want to slap myself in the face for not coming up with it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,glansbergr
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think this would have helped me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as someone who was forced to sit alone sometimes this is absolutely lovely
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh hey an app to systematically exclude people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am really glad that this teenage lady decided to make this app because she wanted to make a difference that is outstanding and she should be applauded we always want young people to try to step up and make a difference good on her i do worry that this app will be used in bad ways but it has the chance to do great things if teachers and the administrators can get involved everywhere it would be successful and do something that a government mandate could never accomplish the word needs to be spread
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty cool i hope some gamification stuff is added so the persongroup doing that lure can be verified not to be a bully really nice and inventive d
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good idea hope it works out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeahcant see that working actively try to find friendstheres enough odd balls weirdo freaks and other groups out there that no one is alone just find them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this app is all really nice and this girl is very kind but high school kids are still not nice take it from someone who just left
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is cute but really sad because i know how this can backfire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why are kids like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gateway to reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was hugely unpopular in school so i was glad of one blessing that i was close enough to home to go there for lunch every day instead of the cafeteria but then kids arent allowed to leave school grounds during school hours anymore are they
UpliftingNews,not_removed,with my luck id log into the app and it would say no open tables sorry nerd
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at my primary school we had the rainbow bench if you had no one to play with youd sit there till someone approached you most kids just used it as a normal bench though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think the social shunning based on my parents income bracket and petty childhood cruelties i received in my youth really helped me be a well adjusted adult not sure why there is a push to coddle kids developing a thick skin is important not just in social interaction but also for workplace effectiveness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why dont kids just talk to each other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is more of a win for young women in tech if she really developed the app herself i dont think the word invent is the right one to use the screenshots look like she had help with at least the graphics or money to pay whoever to do it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if the cool kids were going to invite the strange weird alone kid to sit with them in the first place they could do it without an app in my school we sat together by neighborhood in case shit jumped off like the movie warriors so we were never alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you guys want friends you have to go to the biggest baddest kid in your school and knock him out in front of everyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a mom i can saykids are little assholes the only sweet kid is about months and under
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are hundreds of app ideas that are great theoretically but require a lot of people to actually use them this is one of them in my opinion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awesome idea but honest question how can a teenager make an app so complex thought that was difficult to do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the problem is that the people thinks in loneliness as something bad its part of life and its kind of good and part of the social process
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is why we nerds now rule the world we had to find clever ways to be happy among bullies and in a weird way we have the bullies to thank because outsmarting them makes the world a better place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pain
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant believe all the negative posts on this why do most of you even follow uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats pretty damn cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,highschooler invents myspace
UpliftingNews,not_removed,better hope bullies dont get wind of this instawimpmagnet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,look at how virtuous i am wow we dont see that every day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what about for adults at chilis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,understand the pull at the heart strings the problem is that in the real world no one gives a shit we create a bubble for people and wonder why they fail and blame everyone but themselves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just get used to sitting by yourself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but has it been launched i designed an app that was a work share app but nowhere near enough money to fund oir run it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good idea i spent the first year of high school eating alone in the bathroom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except for the kids who cant afford a smartphone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,update hundreds of kids suspended for using sit in app on their phones in school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can see this not making a big splash at high schools and kids installing it at a local hs one weird kid posts the other sees and joins for lunch the op is very awkward and the other kids nope out and uninstall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id rather sit alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was so lucky when i was in hs i sat with like other guys during lunch we will usually take up a whole row of tables good times
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its kind of sad we need apps for this also why cant they just stand up and tell a lonely kid to come sit with them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at least where im from phones are strictly banned in high school and in class during college uk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this wouldnt be an issue for her if she were beach body ready
UpliftingNews,not_removed,here in the comment section are aged males discussing what kids will do with the app it will have stickers too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read that as slit with us sorry its getting late here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck i prefer to sit by myself i dont need a bunch of mouth breathers disturbing me while i eat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so when i was in school they didnt let you have cell phone out for any reason did that change or do they not care anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i actually saw this in the app store before had no idea what it really was but this is super cool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i still dont know how i didnt commit suicide in high school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh get back to me when someone uses it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,technology wont fix your social awkwardness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why does everyone assume that we want to eat with anyone oftentimes being alone is blissful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,natalie is working on an android version of the app but for those who dont have access to an ios device or a smartphone at school she recommends a low tech version of sit with us tldr fuck windows phone users truly alone and i mean this also in an allegory sense of the high school popularity tech world downvote you will but those represent the same behaviors grade school bullies exhibit too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is just going to lead to more bullying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did she write the code herself bc that would be impressive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but then you get to college and everyone wants to sit alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wheres the adult version for the rare occasion im at a bar
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this seems like a useless app
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but if any high school was like mine many years ago no students should have phones with them they should be in their lockers sooooo the app is used when then but still a good idea
UpliftingNews,not_removed,on wednesdays we wear pink
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bot for a programming class project that has gone longer than expected because folks seem to like it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wild
UpliftingNews,not_removed,simple solution skip lunch and drink a protein shake instead go to library to do work or go to the gym and to ask to use the weights this is what ive done since freshman year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,only available on the app store well there goes at least half of the kids that might want this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is absolutely amazing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,finally a useful app way to go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if she outsourced the coding to india
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at this rate we can rid the world of all bad things by
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank god for this teen girl and her programming its amazing to see underrepresented individuals show their passion in technology now that we have women taken care of what about transgender genderqueer genderfluid androgoqueer and transimmigrant hispanic females we need more females in programming asap pile them on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because none of these children will ever have to deal with rejection and loneliness in real life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no thanks i am not sitting with dorks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont get the bullying mentality humans were just the worst arent we
UpliftingNews,not_removed,useless for kids too poor to afford cell phones must be nice being raised welltodo those of born poor hate you not for your wealth but for your lack of awareness about how good you have it fuck you douchebags
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a really great idea i hope she becomes a billionaire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what if you want to eat alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wish i had that in high school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,she coded it herself no surprise nobody wanted to sit with her
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god forbid kids actually learn to socialize and do this without an app seriously though part of the reason and need for this app is because kids are afraid to get out if their comfort zones to socialize and interact which creates this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive got a fucking app for you its called talk to people and make fucking friends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,notice no fat kids in the app because nothing is sadder than a goodrelated app on a fat kids phone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a beautiful human being hope its successful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,instantly cooped by bullies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a little disappointed this requires an app
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the illustration is terrible inch thigh gaps in tall twentysomethings whoever designed this had no idea what a group of diverse high school kids would look like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if she actually created it kudos to her if she has the time to learn both java and swift while being in school and learning other subjects
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think its a terrific idea and i wish her all the best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so has anyone actually read the article this is honestly a really cool idea people seem to be majorly reacting to the title but this young ladys been through some shit and created an app based on her experiences to try to make other peoples lives easier obviously you need other users of the app for it to work but if it caught on i could see this working out for some people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does it work for adults too im lonely af 😔
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the might shoot us app or for the optimistic dont shoot us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,could me sit with us invitation rescinded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how its possible for someone to eat lunch alone is it a thing in usa in my teen in my country i never saw someone alone at lunch even the more ankwards kids had a friend or two or more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,writing a few lines of code is invention now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the problem with society the everyone wins mentality face it there are winners and losers in this world and it pays to be a winner do you do this at your work you know that creepy guy at work do you go and hang out with them of course you dont
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what ever happened to kids making friends through social interactions dont be so afraid to say hi to new people they dont bite in an innercity this really hasnt been a problem thank god you suburban kids are weird though that hierarchy bullshit doesnt fly when everyone is practically in the same struggles as you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice hashtag invention
UpliftingNews,not_removed,come on millennials stop being such stereotypical pussies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,omg shes gorgeous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what are the odds that someone with no friends would also have no phone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while uplifting its more pathetic than anything that kids cant rely on their social skills or build them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who would i mean its such a high viz way of showing youre all alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my school had one bench installed and called it the no friends bench where kids who dont have anyone to play with sit on it problem is theres no other benches so people simply sat on it because they wanted to sit down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah we had a friendship stop which basically had the same purpose i also dont remember it being used although i was only five at the time so maybe someone got some use out of it and ive just forgotten
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this made me sad for the high vis kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the high vis kids were the ones with no friends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was a high viz kid but with regular clothes but i tried to hide so the adults wouldnt ask why i wasnt playing with anyone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my school had a friendship bench
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stranger can i sit with you teen i have a boyfriend
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,teen invents app what no no that isnt how that works
UpliftingNews,not_removed,usually there is a good reason they dont have friends source i dont have friends for a good reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its getting them ready for when they are old enough for tinder
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can never have enough rejection in your life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id forget the app if i were you just find a relatively small group of three or four people that youve seen in classes and seem nice and ask to sit with them the vast majority of people will say yes noone is going to make fun of you for making an effort to talk to them it might seem embarrassing or whatever but in the long run it doesnt really matter at all and youve got nothing to lose so why not give it a shot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it does not work well when there are literally zero users this is basically the problem with every app that relies on people meeting up or communicating if nobody is using it theres no point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a great idea maybe you could write to hergive feedback on the app asking to partner up with facebook
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive been trying it also but apparently its frowned upon for an adult male to try to eat lunch with high school kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you just copied the same reply from when this was posted on news hours ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would totally sit with youi think it sucks that people are left isolated at school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,something like a panera near you has an open table which means its just strangers who are cool with sharing the lunch experience with one another and having a conversation i actually really like this idea i think it would be great to have one table designated as the communal table at places like panera or starbucks where the idea is only single folks or maybe even couples can sit at so that hopefully the people sitting there talk to one another
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have continued to sit alone lmao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no one will download the app with that attitude mate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,join a sport or club sit with them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sorry you have to sit alone when i was in high school we had this kid named greg in my grade and he was a little off and sat alone i made it a point to sit with him and after awhile a lot of my friends sat with us too and we became a group or whatever he was cool as shit just real awkward and it made him seem weirder than he was i think you should just find someone youd like to sit with and ask if you could join with them during lunch if they say yes then great if they say no then they arent people youd want to be around anyways so also great good luck and feel free to pm me if you ever need anyone to talk to theres no reason for anyone to be alone who doesnt want to be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was such a loner in school the bullys were afraid of me becuase they thought i would bring a gun into school a couple people even told me that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess technically thats what tinder is though and its popular
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also because you could just as well life your head and look for an empty sit with your own eyes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey meet me for lunch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wouldnt have cared about the cool kids downloading it it would have been fine to have another socially anxious but not creepy person to talk to we never would have dared talk to teach other without the knowledge that the other was open to doing so i am a lively conversationist with a large amount of stuff to discuss but i have never gone up and introduced myself to a stranger especially in high school when we had individual stools at the tables so you couldnt squeeze to allow one more person in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sureeeeee you can sit with us kid is that chips you have in your lunch you need a nickname kid what should we call him boys how about stooly stooly sounds good you like that name stooly sit down stooly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is clearly a trap to single out the kids who dont have any friends for bullying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same i loved eating alone and always got annoyed when people came up to me and said oh you poor thing you can sit with us like i was some sort of charity case i mean i was a charity case but i still enjoyed eating alone and reading my book
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always went to the computer lab and played games during my lunches in school many years after graduating i still dont have many friends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same but i still felt embarrassed to be seen eating alone i guess because of the perception that alone loser its really a nowin situation for someone like me i hated highschool so so much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well for a lot of people the hardest part of socialization is initiation and thats a barrier that keeps a lot of people alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had the cheerleader table kindly invite me over one day because i sat alone and they wanted to feel better about themselves bad all around it was painfully awkward for me and i got the shit kicked out of me later not by one of their boyfriends but by one of the scumbags who wanted to fuck them and didnt have a chance and who outweighed me by pounds
UpliftingNews,not_removed,altruistic but not actually being that way i think the motivation of relating to the lone outsider from experiences of the past also applies also once someones been around long enough they know they can be riding high today but down in the dump tomorrow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the consequences for bulllies should be much bigger the only way to stop them doing it is to make it unlikely theyll want to do it again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,raise your hand if youve ever felt personally victimized by regina george
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at my school its an hour there are two people at tables adjacent to mine that literally sleep the entire lunch because theyre too afraid to sit with anyone that was me in middle school however i just said fuck it and now i just sit down and if anyone has a problem with it i dont care
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you look at the contents on rall youll see people explaining that they didnt dare to sit with strangers because they would get beaten frequently the goal of the app of to guaranteea safe welcome for me the only problem is that people could use it to trap others
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man i know this sounds whiny as hell probably but i had major social anxiety in school i wouldnt actively feel it its not like id think of talking to people then suddenly my throat would just swell and i couldnt move but i dare not just go sit next to a stranger especially when theyre with other friends and start up a conversation it sounds ridiculous because yeah just going over and talking to them does sound easy but for a lot of people it doesnt feel easy if theres a way to let other students who feel isolated know that if they want a friend theyre there to sit next to then thats amazing you dont know who the friendly ones are you dont know who will be mean or which ones the most likely scenario will just stare at you like you came from space because you dared interrupt their little bubble i for one think its great for people who feel like outcasts or suffer from feelings of isolation and have poor abilities to reach out and i think its absurd so many here are trying to twist it into some new bullshit way of fishing for kids to bully so much for uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as someone who was bullied and pushed around i wouldve killed for an app like this just to find the decent people in between the bandwagon bullies once youre an outcast everyone starts avoiding you like the plague because they dont want to be bullied with you your perspective feels like that of someone who was never alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does every social interaction now have to be initiated by an app that is not really what is going on here i am sure this is intended for a small subset of social interactions where the participants have trouble getting started
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if people want to sit with other people then go sit with them as easy as that eh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i totally agree with you having to interact with strangers irl is an important life skill everyone needs to have you cant and shouldnt depend on an app to simply walk up to someone and say hi
UpliftingNews,not_removed,socializing in middle and high school isnt like socializing in the real world if you have nobody at all to sit with chances are that youve been bullied and feel a strong sense of ostracization reaching out isnt about being social its about the fact youve been conditioned by the same exact group of kids for years that they dont like you they dont want you and you will feel humiliated if you try to befriend them i had really really awful social anxiety growing up going to college was a godsend while i still had anxiety it got so much better it turns out its way easier to go up and talk to strangers who dont know you and might like you than to reach out to people youve kind of sort of known for years who youre already pretty sure dont like you otherwise why arent you friends by now trying to make friends in that atmosphere is almost impossible for people like me our entire illness can be basically summed up as such i felt like a loser at some point and so internalized it now every time i try to be social my body has a physical reaction because i cant forget what a loser i am in a place where youve already been deemed and categorized as a loser or a geek or whatever that feeling isnt just in our head social interactions really are involved in how little social standing we have and the knowledge that they known were a loser just makes us unable to ignore what a loser we are and then we spiral and have a panic attack trying to talk to someone new and that really does nothing to help your reputation and i had friends not a ton of them band geek but there was always a few friend or two i could sit with and then they usually had more friends to form a lunch group i was not by an means considered a loner i was a nerd who had plenty of nerd friends but the first few day of lunch were nerve racking because its not about the ability to make friends lunch is where you meet up the friend group you already have and if you dont already have a friend to sit with attempts to reach out to other groups is often treated fairly poorly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if people want to sit with other people then go sit with them does every social interaction now have to be initiated by an app fuck how come nobody thought of that call the news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree the app sounds like a bandage that will come off after a day but gee please do understand that for kids being actively bullied and isolated by their peers it really is not so simple imagine all of your peer girls always eating in a big circle except you you ask them to let you in but they all pretend like they didnt hear you and even start calling you a whore without any basis in fact personally i chose to eat my lunch my mother made for me in the toilet alone over that humiliation every day every year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how do the swiss manage to achieve that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you really dont have a single loner i find that hard to believe there isnt a single weird kid nobody is friends with and nobody really wants to be friends with cliques werent really that much of a thing at my high school but people still formed groupings based off friendships with one another and if you didnt have any close friendsthat meant being alone i just find it hard to believe swiss culture doesnt have loners
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it happens everywhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bullshit im sure this happens in your country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bullshit any person that says there country schools doesnt have any social problems or bullies is lying out their fucking teeth even extremely peaceful countries like japan have social and bullying problems im really getting sick of redditors acting like the usa is this ultra violent thrid world country and that every bad thing that happens there only happens there your is country isnt perfect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what doesnt happen in switzerland phone apps or loneliness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the funny thing is that i used to be in a private international school and all english speaking people would discriminate me for who i was except for a few rare exceptions i then moved to the swiss public system and bam i was shocked at how well people accepted each other and how friendly the general ambient was and private school kids would say public school was horrible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,looks like a app for sure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you see the new south park without social media to find out what your friends are doing you become a social pariah youll have to hang out in a park with others like you that have cancelled twitter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not like people dont like it because shes trying its because the thing she made is inherently flawed the creator is probably very nice and thinks that people will use this app for good but there are so many ways to exploit it so people will probably get bullied more for using it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt go to hs in any major cities just your run of the mill population places and all but of my high schools had over people and the that didnt was more of a fluke it had several hundred and was very rural the largest hss in the usa have students nytx
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except this app would help kids find people to talk to so that they could develop their social skills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,every school offers programming and im sure she used her savings or a free trial to make an app on free with contract iphones just because i live in the fast lane doesnt mean im poor as well ill save up for a rbifl item so im not wasting a ton on quantity and getting more out of my product i seriously hate how android users think ios users are pricey snobs i think android phones are low powered too many settings that keep having to be tweaked ive not seen a rugged phone besides rogue ios has a nice market just about every phone is free these days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,still alone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in america theyre banned completely in high school cant have them in class between class or lunch technically not supposed to have them on a bus either but thats up to the driver really in college though at least from what ive heard you can do whatever the fuck you want
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rjustneckbeardthings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in most high schools you are allowed to use them at certain times lunch break and passing periods you can have your phone out but in your classes the teacher decides
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are programs where the us government will literally give you phones shut the hell up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then you dont use the app and eat alone instead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont get why this was downvoted so much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you want them to learn to socialize but you are against an app that will help them find people to learn to socialize with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds great until you actually break it down into pros and cons
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dae all quiet kids have to potential to be mass murderers boy im witty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,few lines of code have you seen the article i honestly dont believe that she did it copying from my hackernews comment from here on out she would have needed to make a frontend images and a backend the app does chatting too and stores login data not just oauth httpsitwithusio theyre also registering as a nonprofit the website blocks right clicks y tho and in the keywords there are names presumably the other people that made the app presumably parents because of last names the main page is before allowed to phone back home again to get images etc head alone takes up lines and ends on start shoppoing cart which is a bit odd body ends on include flash embed scripts which indicates that this was probably copied from another place with little to no editing it also phones paypalobjects for some reason though i cant find a donate button also the responsive design has been commented out though i can see why after uncommenting it all the images dont scale at all all in all i think they im saying that because she definitely had a lot of help if not all of it by her parents subcontracted the app out to indiachina or the dad knows app dev and used a boilerplate web cms any self respecting webdev wouldnt let their main page be before even touching the server for more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if its an original idea and you make it yes that is an invention
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i actually had to look this up because even as a software engineer the term invent in the title seemed a bit out of place to me as far as ive always been concerned i create software not invent it however after some googling around it seems that apparently in the context of ideas one apparently creates an idea in their mind and then after translating it into reality as a tangible product it can fairly be called an invention so i guess it would all boil down to whether you consider software tangible i suppose id just as soon not use the term invention when describing software but thats just me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i actually do whenever im at any event and see someone sitting by themselves i go ask if i can sit with them if they say no i move on though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no they dont bite they just say go away you stupid idiot who do you think you are lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you are the kind of kid who is sitting completely alone every day the idea of rejection is pretty much not going to allow you to ask someone if you can join their lunch its just a way to say anyone who wants to sit with us can
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you sound angry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like a bench we had in elementary school but like you said random people would just sit there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honestly that sounds better still a chance someone looking for someone to play with finds a person at least and probably a lot less stigma for going there in the first place who the fuck would ever sit on a no friends bench if you could only use it in that capacity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god dammit can you remember anything john
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they were probably happy to do it they set up these programs to give the volunteer kids a sense of accomplishment and duty that they lap up when i was in elementary school we had peer mediators who would be out in yellow vests to help kids resolve disagreements without teacher intervention we took turns so we still got to play they even took us to the courthouse as part of training to make us feel important
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol in college it goes like freshman hey whatre you studying stranger im a junior
UpliftingNews,not_removed,projecting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you cant sit with us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stranger can i sit with you teen erm no you fucking stink and youre mums a whore hahaha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats the reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how do you figure that noone is going to make fun of you for making an effort to talk to them high school bullies just love doing that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one alternative that happened to me in college is people doing it to you so about or weeks ago i was going up to get some food in our campus center i leave my backpack on the table so no one takes the table i come back and theres a massive group of people who have taken my table and the next table so i just kinda sat down and started eating and eventually started making small talk none of them knew me and i didnt know any of them and i think they thought i knew someone there and i never even introduced myself college is weird
UpliftingNews,not_removed,find three or four people good luck with that the vast majority of people will say yes true noone is going to make fun of you for making an effort to talk to them not directly only behind your back it might seem embarrassing or whatever but in the long run it doesnt really matter at all and youve got nothing to lose so why not give it a shot who doesnt want to be the weird kid who has noone to sit with so tries to force himself on our groups but we are not dicks and doesnt want to say no
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ya i think youre giving teens a little too much credit if some weird kid came up to my group of friends and asked to site with us during lunch we probably wouldve given the old uhhhhh ok and made awkward snickering sounds as everyoen remained silent not knowing what to say to the weird kid who for some reason wanted to sit with us weirdos shit at my high school we got to go off campus for lunch and walk around the town and stuff by the time i was a senior i really could give two fucks about sitting with my friends and a lot of times i hung out at my car listening to music and bsing with random people who i knew that was walking by by the time you were a senior ya pretty much know everyone in your grade
UpliftingNews,not_removed,noone is going to make fun of you for making an effort to talk to them to build off on this the trite advice to have confidence when approaching people should also include a caveat you will do much better if you internally look forward to the thrill of talking with new people instead of the dangers moods definitely affect how well other people respond towards you we have senses other than sight think of it this way both cats and dogs behave far nicer to people who dont approach them fearfully or hatefully why would it be any different with people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty weird huh i wonder which ones the bot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at my grade school there was one day that for some reason we were allowed to sit wherever we wanted instead of usual assigned seats i chose to sit in my normal spot while everyone else sat at crowded tables yelling to hear each other over everyone else one of the teachers actually came up to me during lunch and told me i was allowed to sit wherever my response was just i know im fine i feel like she tried to pressure me more i cant remember much else
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think we as a society undervalue solitary and overvalue connection
UpliftingNews,not_removed,except they are kids the worst people on he planet they are old enough to know how to think but young enough to truly think theyll never have last consequences so they do whatever they want detention wont do it and suspension for bullying is hard because you can no longer escalate punishment for more serious offenses without kicking the kid out of school which is a no go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dunno about what school you are goingwent to but at mine or all of them bullies get zero punishment however the person sticking up for themselves or others gets the punishment even if no one sticks up for the personpeople getting bullied the bullies still dont get punished example i was going through the halls and a girl was crying and a bunch of people were making fun of right in front of a teacher the teacher was even rude to the kid calling her a baby when the kid walked away another example i just moved and im going to a high school in the south a lot of people are highly racist here and not in a mocking manner either i didnt witness this first hand but multiple people had told me about it a bunch of black kids were blocking the halls saying no crackers allowed and hitting white kids and pushing them if they tried to get to their classes their punishment a teacher said just go back to class even for things as blatant racism violence or just outright rudeness no one gets punished but if i go over to the crying girl and try and comfort her i get told by the teachers im getting a detention for bothering her or picking on her when she literally said thank you to me for actually being nice to her tldr bullies dont get punished the people who stand against bullies do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i always hear the only surefire way to deal with bullies is to beat the piss out of them unfortunately thats not really an option anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i was in hs i simply asked people if i could sit with them never once did a group say no i didnt make a regular habit of it normally i hung out with my close group of friends but id occasionally go and sit with others i never aligned to a particular clique and had zero problems being around any group where things go wrong for most is that they pick a clique to associate themselves with and then clique rivalries get in the way if youve branded yourself as the jock youre no longer going to hang out with the goth kids if thats even still a thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant imagine a school where you get beaten for asking to sit with people it seems like the sort of person who would assault you for speaking to them would be easy to spot and avoid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly my thoughts dinner for schmucks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought that too i hope that people arent so malicious there must be a way to report users so many if they act that way it only happens once
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah that other poster is either an elder or had enough friends in school that they never felt alone i didnt have any friends from primary until middle school and then high school came and i spent each lunch in the bathroom by myself soooo out of years i had a friend thats a decade of loneliness if i didnt have my husband now i would still be depressed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was a social butterfly until my parents split up and i was bounced between their households all through high school by grade id attended different high schools i dont remember very much about that time of my life but i do remember getting in trouble often because id leave or try to leave school to go sit at mcdonaldswhatever to eat lunch alone since i didnt know anyone walking into the cafeteria practically gave me a panic attack my parents were also active duty military so i lead a pretty isolated life that basically revolved around playing ultima online and driving around by myself it was just easier for me to go sit in my car or drive around for the hour i remember one school id go hide in the bathroom because they were absolute pricks about me leaving the building and would suspend me or march me to the cafeteria youd think i could go sit in the library or something but i dont think that was allowed either nobody ever asked why i was leaving or really gave a shit which as a grown adult is probably what upsets me the most as im sure there are handfuls of other kids in the same situation who are badgered and disciplined over whats already soul crushing anxiety
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive always felt that way in social situations you have to force yourself to do it there wont always be an app to help you especially in the working world actually i worry about this a little since my daughter is in grade and i see them repeatedly doing things like ending games early so there is no winner to avoid conflict or hurt feelings what kind of adults will we have if we work so hard to avoid any kind of social discomfort or hurt feelings or recognition that you dont always win things arent always fair or equal i think we already see some of the outcome of that with the millennials but worry it will only get worse throw these future adults into a stressful situation and they will likely crumble
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre that kid interactions will be rejection so you learn to stop even trying this app is about saving that kid from those awful experiences man of them that they will remember and be haunted by well into adulthood and just instantly connecting them with that one kid who actually has a little bit of empathy and kindness for them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not weird for athletes and nerds to hang out at lunch or in class together and the split is barely visible until after the school day is over
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they do hes just lying to go on yet another americans are uncivilized rant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey i am not saying it doesnt exist i just havent heard of a single case of bullying in the swiss equivalent of high school in the lower grades what equates as middle school yes it does happen dont take this personally i am not attacking the us in any way shape or form im just taking facts based on my perspective
UpliftingNews,not_removed,brunettes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how ever did we make it as kids and a species prior to smart phones and social media just go sit next to someone they are going to do one of three things ignore you be nice and talk to you or tell you to fuck off take a risk learn from it and move on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have no idea what point youre trying to make here i never said iphone users are snobs fact is though iphones are relatively speaking a lot more expensive that androids any comparable iphone can be up to twice as expensive as an android most iphone users are people that have the money to spend or fanboys its simple dude if i have a tight budget like the majority of people in the world then do i go for an android i can afford or do i go for an iphone that does the same but is times as expensive that is a simple choice for the majority of people and also the reason why android by far is the largest phone os world wide kids who have iphones usually will have rich parents rich kids usually will be more popular which is what all this article was about to begin with i did not pass on apple at all in my comment so i dont know why youre so ticked off apple fanboy perhaps and the app that was shown was a professionally built app nothing trial there could she have built it all by herself the designs servers infrastructure programming testing etc etc etc sure could she design and build a complete house by myself all the architectural work wood work concrete cementing windows etc sure both are doubtful though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe but there is some potential where you can build upon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im in high school in america and we can have them in passing periods and lunch so maybe its just your high school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck you some of us dont qualify for those programs in account of being too white and too male fuck you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because whats the point in saying this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,true but optimism never hurts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminds me of people in a programming class copying code they found on the internet on stackoverflow or github for their assignments but they forget to edit comments or fix lines that would make sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds more like one of those click and drag build your own website hosts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my problem is with the fact that once software is declared an invention the copyright issue can be used to harass people nonstop we anyway dont get the source code of the app that we purchase tinkering with it is illegal anyway so we are pretty much fucked as customers by calling softwares inventions right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,looks like its me today to give the generic right in the feels comment but yeah thats a damn sad picture
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was when he lay down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy shit i completely forgot about peer mediation kid that was me and i remember going to through the trainings on a weekly basis and never doing anything after that now i do municipal mediation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh my god we had almost the same program at one of my old schools except we never had the vests it never worked but i could still probably resolve an argument better than most of the teachers ive had and have
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never see any hostility between anyone any age any classification at my uni im convinced its the greatest place on earth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a major in ravioli
UpliftingNews,not_removed,too soon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not a movie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am a serious asshole because i get bored with people the more i spend time with them i start acting out and people start shunning me i start out good but quickly become an ass meet me once though and youd think i was a very polite and nice person i can be for a while but not for a year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre a highschool student who isnt fitting in with any of the highschool cliques an app is not going to change that it will also become a point of ridicule as a person who did not fit in looking back at it i was mostly to blame for that instead of getting an app to make up for lack of social skills join band theater club any club youll make friends and then youll have people to sit with during lunch using that app is going to be like a scarlett letter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,high school bullies yes the key to his advice was to find a group you already have familiarità with who seem nice most folks who already have friends dont go out of their way to approach more but nice people there are nice people in high school will almost always be open to people who approach them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,find the quiet kid even if they do have friends theyll probably accept
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive been sneak assimilated in college as well my only gripe was if i had been sitting alone reading i felt awkward going back to it and felt obligated to socialize
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the alternative is realizing none of this shit will matter in a few years and just do whatever the fuck you want
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in high school i had a number of friends in different cliques one day i decided that it was ridiculous that certain tables were exclusive so i decided to sit down at the popular kids read rich sports stars table i played soccer with some of them every day had been good elementary school friends with some of them had helped others with assignments in various classes why the hell couldnt i sit there so i walked up smiled said hey and sat down the entire group went silent and just stared one person said what are you doing just saying hey i started to eat my lunch horrified no one spoke a word they just stared i made a little polite conversation with someone next to me they responded with oneword answers i couldnt believe this was actually happening what was this a teen movie why were they my friends in small numbers but couldnt act like human beings at the lunch table after several excruciating minutes i said see you around and walked back to my typical lunch table goth emo skater kids mostly though i dressed preppy myself they were like what were you doing laughed at me and gave me a warm welcome that helped wash down the bitter taste of ostracization and defeat bunch of pretentious rich fucks ill take the weirdos any day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so your solution is what being lonely and bitter and believing the worst of people at the end of the day high school problems are completely trivial and you look back on them and laugh at how much the younger you cared so why not make an effort it certainly beats looking dejectedly down at your sandwich every day and wishing that things were better
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trust me man people dont care if you try to make friends with them only if their douches if you were always worried about forcing yourself into peoples groups then yea youre gonna stay alone edit unless you find other kids that are alone and become friends with them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,go back and think about the all around famous kids who were new to school or whatever how did they make themself be friends with others its the exact same way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not directly only behind your back ehh so long as you arent being really creepyannoying most people wont do that just tell them none of my friends have the same lunch period as me and the majority of people will be fine with you sitting with them and not make fun of you afterward the only time i ever saw anyone get made fun of for latching onto a random group was because the guy was creepy and annoying it had nothing to do with him not having other people to sit with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honestly why would you worry about what some dickheads say behind your back back when i was in highschoo most people would look down on petty gossiping shits like that speaking ill of others over something so benign is a pretty good way of making others dislike and distrust you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shit at my high school we got to go off campus for lunch and walk around the town and stuff they actually let you do that if we got caught leaving the building during the school day or even leaving the cafeteria during lunch wed get suspended and that was before they put cameras up all over the school and made everyone wear id cards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this poster is rnews comment was posted hours before
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this i his is definitely what is going to happen source currently in high school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not saying its an easy problem i am saying those who are bullied shouldnt suffer needlessly its complex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone at my school got in school suspension and a threat of expulsion if he did anything else had just for blocking another kids phone number it wasnt like a school phone or anything it was his own phone and off of campus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dunno about what school you are goingwent to but at mine or all of them bullies get zero punishment however the person sticking up for themselves or others gets the punishment certainly a big part of the problem even if no one sticks up for the personpeople getting bullied the bullies still dont get punished example i was going through the halls and a girl was crying and a bunch of people were making fun of right in front of a teacher the teacher was even rude to the kid calling her a baby when the kid walked away sounds like a lack of appropriate teacher training and responsibility the teacher should equally be subject for review if this occurs we need better education and tools in place to deal with this case in point im not american i was listening to this american life a few years back and in jackson how a judge punished people for stealing under a certain amount say at a store he would make them stand outside the store on the sidewalk for passing traffic to see for a week holding a sign that read i stole from this store everyday for days with a court appointed supervisor it was cost effective for the state and proved one of the most affective at preventing recursive behaviour by in large—it worked im not saying this method would work for bullies but you can be sure there are solutions to stop the same people from continuing it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unless you wanna go home for quite a few days i truly hate our school system
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some of them probably bully because they get bullied and piss beaten out of them at home there needs to be a comprehensive solution while includes parents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i went to hs with about other kids in my class i see now that was a smart move on the schools part because if you didnt like your lunch table there were people youve never met before across the lunch room but i think some people exaggerate their experience slightly id imagine a high school that had someone beaten would be found liable for damages and would thus discipline the beater i mean i cant speak for outside the us but i cant imagine someone getting away with beating someone without getting caught in this age of camera phones
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a lot of kids dont feel comfortable doing that i bend aligned with a clique but if you are self conscious it can be a terrifying to simply ask to sit with someone yeah they will probably say yes but what if they say no the thought of that was enough to deter me from asking to sit with anyone i would have been mortified plus getting the seat is only the beginning once you sit down you have to be social because you are the one that asked for the seat if you act awkward theyll never want to sit with you again or even if they are nice about it theyll secretly hate that youre there and thats even worse than sitting alone this thinking is totally ridiculous of course and i agree that people need to develop social skills but if this app takes away that initial barrier and you know someone has accepted you before you sit down you can feel more comfortable at first and maybe open up a bit i know it would have helped me a lot in school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you had an experience good for you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what if you dont have a close group of friends though and one thing to remember is that even if people dont say no that doesnt mean they like you having sit with them its a very real possibility that theyre just gonna think youre weird and talk about that behind your back
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a ton of projection in this thread with people remembering their high school years and assuming it is the norm everywhere all the time while i havent seen bullying this severe it can be terrible as in some kids kill themselves i have to assume that not of the kids actively bully outcasts all the time but im going to go out on a limb and suppose that there can be an agressive minority and a majority who lukewarmly doesnt want to be associated with outcasts and ignores you or sneers if you ask to sit with them yes it sounds crazy but just read stories of bullied kids it happens and it can be everybody against you an app like that is an occasion to provide a safe space and break the bystander effect
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most comedies in the last decade or so have been atrocious but this looks like a bit of a laugh do you recommend it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not american either but theres countless stories of people getting beaten at school with no repercussion so i guess not unless it gets serious enough for the hospital i mean where i live its accepted that kids will fight sometimes it seems crazy when you think about it that the same behaviour between adults would send one to prison
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same no friendsbulliedoutcast in primary school then hid away in the library for years in comprehensive high school dropped out of college with depression and anxiety its not an easy thing to get out of i wasnt emotionally mature enough to work out how to fix my issues and its something most adults find difficult even with professional help people without mental health issues just think social skills are the only problem even as adults whereas its just the first casualty of anxiety
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gives you a hug and an upvote ditto i had aspergers that wasnt diagnosed until i was and i was very familiar with the bathroom and the library later ditched so grateful for my husband even if i did not find him until i was better late than never and i did make best friends with a girl similar to me at age so it wasnt all bad but those early years ugh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup i had a really isolated childhood i was in a really tense home situation and had adhd i now know so i really struggled with making friends and behaving appropriately as a kid i was lucky i grew into being slightly pretty i learned from my first job in a restaurant how to fake being friendly and i smile as a nervous reaction so people started behaving more warmly to me it didnt matter how many friends i later made or how positively people reacted to me in social interactions its really hard to forget that isolation no matter how old you get you feel exactly like that helpless little kid who nobody wants to be friends with and everyone thinks is weird on the inside
UpliftingNews,not_removed,see and thats why if this app could be well used its a great thing it makes me sad to see some people in the comments here say theyve used it and it didnt help because no one in the school was using it but it makes me far more sad seeing people in other comments twist it into some new bullying tactic or worse belittling the very real anxieties a lot of kids feel because when they sat alone they wanted to be left alone as if that applies to everyone is life better for you now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people are becoming more compassionate and learning that sharing is better than winning the point is to change the world to have no conflict or as much cooperation as possible when you grow up with people being hard on you you end up being hard on others its really not the answer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and people will figure that out when push comes to shove people will eventually realize its sink or swim thats life you either put in the effort or dont but having a friend you know you can reach out to in the right time will probably help that persons confidence more in the future than throwing up in the bathroom because they couldnt bring themselves to talk to someone life isnt just about forcing yourself to do shit and for some people forcing yourself to take on certain situations is far more impossible to do than it is for others there wont always be an app no but when theres a situation where there can be something to help someone such as an app then good for those people that will benefit and i wouldnt worry too much about millennials i feel like everyone sees what they want to see regarding that situation as someone in that generation i can tell you a lot of us despise the whole there are no losers everyone is special mentality because our previous generation raised a lot of us in that light and the reality of the world is different its fucked up when you tell a kid hisher entire life theyre meant for something great and the reality is theyre just gonna be another pencil pusher in a middle management job because the real world doesnt have enough room for everyone to achieve their dream a lot of us are paying the highest rates of insurance at the age were least capable of paying it a lot of us have to take out loans to survive in school to even have a chance at a job we dont despise or work ourselves to the point of blowing out to make the requirements of a scholarship most of us have to band together with friends because we simply cant afford to live on our own in this world we know the deal people tend to figure it out but having friends to rely on peers to watch our backs its helped
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is how it was in my school in venezuela granted we were a pretty small class but everyone was friends with everyone there were people that did sports some liked computers some a bit of both etc we all hung out together and there was no jocks nerds divide ever we all graduated and even years later most of us are friends and keep in touch and visit each other when traveling etc its really sad reading articles like this to me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it isnt as segregated as all these people are saying at every school in fact i thought the cliquey stuff was more of a tv trope my high school was much better about this kinda stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im currently going to high school in connecticut and thats about how it goes here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jesus if only we had this when i was i school school in the us is terrible for the underdogs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol i went to two of the whitest schools you could imagine and it was far from a harmonious playground
UpliftingNews,not_removed,idk why should this matter to kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats sweden
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im male and white and telling you if your income is low enough you qualify
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well why was i downvoted i was just asking i thought maybe i was missing a reference or something but okay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that would also explain the main page
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree as a side note i do quite a bit of reverse engineering and here in the us there is legal precedence for that kind of tinkering being completely lawful within reason my issue is actually with software patents copyrights are one thing this is my software dont copy it without my permission but once people try to patent software this is the result of my code dont do anything that has a similar result then you get companies trying to patent things like the act of logging into something or jumping in a video game as innovative atari actually did this shit when it patented the concept of minigames at loading screens and squaresoft when it patented special battle screens sequences stifling innovation the term invented sounds a little too much like something that can be patented for my tastes which is why i tend to use the term creation which feels like it falls under something more appropriately artistic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because they dont really have to ask its hey those group of people are willing to let me sit with them if i want all i have to do is go over there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the question is is it anatomically correct or other words used does it serve multipurpose
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now im going to invent an app called shit with us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my catholic school had a whites only stoop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which uni is it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah like the beach
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this really rings true for me i wish the solution was as simple as an app but realistically the common denominator is the person themselves theres absolutely no issue with this and i think there is a pressure people put themselves under to change i always found it hard to get along with people at school er i mean i didnt speak to people at school or when i did was ridiculed and it wasnt until i found a job in hospitality and developed some social skills that i looked back and saw how cringeworthy some of my anecdotes were
UpliftingNews,not_removed,join band yes one hundred times yes even if youre awful at music the people dont really care that much and its mostly just about having fun especially in high school ive been a band kid my whole life and i dont think there are nicer people anywhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my high school didnt have band or theatre and now that im long gone they do sigh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have you ever been bullied i mean really bullied i dont mean you were kind of awkward in school and only had a couple friends i mean real bullying because it sounds like you havent your entire attitude is one of someone who was just awkward not bullied those are two completely different things someone who is actually being bullied cant generally fix it by suddenly developing adultlike communication and coping skills while they are in their teens sounds like great advice until you think about it for a few minutes and then you realize its actually kind of a backhanded victim blame
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we moved the summer before my freshman year this app would have helped me i eventually found a group but weeks of being alone in a new school blows
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just graduated from highschoolcan confirm joining theater club was one of my better choices in life my only regret was i didnt join soonerhigschool wouldnt have been as enjoyable if i didnt join that club
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can do the same in university i have friends but none that really wanna join the clubs that i want to so i walked in alone just sit beside someone whos also alone and go from there maybe my effort is why i have friends in the first place though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean i could have probably started reading i was more shocked that they just swarmed in within like minutes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes because awkward bullied teenagers have the mental wiring and perspective to think like this nearly every piece of advice in this thread has been think act and react like an adult wouldat years old its like all of you forgot what being a teenager is actually like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,none of this shit will matter and a day later you realize you have minimal social skills and zero connections
UpliftingNews,not_removed,teenagers literally cant comprehend that none of it matter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in high school i was not popular i had a great tribe of weird friends and all was good then there was track season it was my only sport and i was good for that season i was invited to hang with the popular kids and jocks invited to their parties and was treated like of of them as soon as the season ended they would not even say hello in the hallway and acted like we had never met all years it was bizarre after the first year i didnt go to their parties etc and understood what it was senior year i was elected captain of the track and field team by people that otherwise thought i didnt exist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is extremely weird how self awere humans are yet act like packs of animals in groups
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because you can make it worse ive seen people who made their situation worse by trying to reach out the cruelest just took it as opportunities to bully the shit out of them and people who were bullied and ostracized to such a severe level dont look back and laugh at how little it mattered usually they struggle with depression and social anxiety for many more years and try to think about those years as little as possible because it doesnt stop hurting there is a difference between not being popular and being ostracized and i fully reccomend they work on their social skills but i dont know high school is the best place for that theyve already been labelled unworthy and most kids arent going to be receptive to them because of that bullying is a real issue id rather have a kid quietly stare into their sandwich go to college or the workforce and then start trying to make connections now that theyre not in such a high pressure broiler of social bullshit than reach out repeatedly in high school be rejected and bullied and then become even more alienated it may seem silly but people kill themselves over this they kill themselves as teens and they kill themselves as adults because of stupid high school shit its only stupid and petty of it wasnt traumatic for you for many its a wound that they learn to ignore but never completely heals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont have solutions i dont know shit about any field related to this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we get these things called lunch passes at my school and they only give them to juniors and seniors basically you can leave school during lunch if you flash your lunch pass and go get lunch somewhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i graduated from high school in i dont ever remember what i did with my school id after getting it probably threw them away but ya we got to go off campus i used to go to friends houses or wed drive somewhere or when i was a freshmen and stuff wed go to different restaurants in town im sure they no longer allow it there since everyone nowadays gets participation medals and safe spaces in school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is soooo much bullshit though the majority of bullies are stuck up popular kids with giant egos and mummy and daddies and friends that never said no to them either because they love them too much or because they dont actually give a fuck about them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unsure about the film as a whole but the zack galifianakis laughing scene in pretty funny
UpliftingNews,not_removed,please go watch the original french movie its very funny
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its actually a good movie i dont recall when it came out and im too lazy to look it is worth watching
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was okay i wouldnt call it a classic but had a laugh here and there and a lot of dead mice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not op but i do recommend it and i agree about the comedies of the last decade
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont bother this is up there with the atrocities
UpliftingNews,not_removed,werent there other library kids bathroom kids maybe they should make a sit in the library app
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im all for that but i think you can both encourage that as well as the idea that working hard will make you stand out and be rewarded with praise or respect or monetarily or whatever also losing is important its not just about conflict its about how you react to losing you can choose to be bummed or to work hard and do better next time also no conflict really isnt a possible future for humanity people arent all the same there is no way to alter the hard wiring that makes one person gay and another person a psychopath no matter how much you teach them besides that would be super boring bunch of bland people trying not hurt each others feelings all the time and make everything fair and equal ugh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,learning that sharing is better than winning in a world ruled by the natural law of survival of the fittest sharing to the exclusion of winning is a bad lesson to teach kids do we want to live in a world where everyone shares everything fuck yeah but the reality is that world is never going to exist so as a parent you better teach your kids to be competitive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the us seems to have this really weird culture of segregation in high school of course teenagers everywhere have cliques and stupid drama but it isnt down to because he likes football and i like geeking out over arduino or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same here in aus which is suprising since its fairly culturally similar to the us you could still be unpopopular or what not but there was no exlusion based on jocksnerds or whatever cliques in any given group of friends there would be mixes of athletes and people in music classes and advanced math classes etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my high school was so incredibly cliquish that there was no such thing as the popular kids no one talked to anyone outside of their friends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my high school was weirdly similar to mean girls we even had our own plastics although obviously they didnt have a name like that i was never under any delusion that it was normal but a lot of stuff about my high school was weird
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same while it was kind of cliquey it was alot more fluid and just based on interests
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i go to school in the netherlands currently used to live in switzerland and while theres defined social groups outside of school no one is going to reject simply talking to you because of who you are the social groups also encompass a diverse group of people when i went to the us and visited friends i noticed everyone had roughly the same personality
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ummm no just what planet are you on anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also the site you link apparently they moved the site
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes you can sniff the feet if you want you pervert
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just use protection halfbabies are very hard to feed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you couldve just stopped at catholic school and we wouldve known what you meant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,texas am
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like the beach she is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rotten fish raw sewage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people who make fun of you for trying to talk to them are bullies and changing yourself wont help because they dont bully you because youre weird or annoying or fat or different not really they do it for fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that can depend i was a drummer and most of the other drummers in my class had been friends their whole lives including one who had always hated me high school band was one of the roughest times of my high school experience i was so happy when i convinced my parents to let me take a study hall instead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i did years of marching band in high school and i miss it every day it was a wonderful experience i wouldnt trade for the world my kids will be in band
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same with choir no one really cares if you cant sing as long as you dont sing super loudly but my choir friends are people i still talk to today years later and i am now a choir director myself i try to tell my students all the time were like a family of misfits
UpliftingNews,not_removed,after high school i found out that of all the cliques the band and theater geeks really did have the best parties and stupidly crazy amounts of sex i missed out on that i thought i was better than that just shot myself in the foot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i grew up fat so yeah i know what being bullied is about youre right of course the student being bullied generally cant fix their image for those who are bullying them thats not the point the point is there are other aspects of school that if you can find a group to belong to and for the most part get themselves out of the loner situation that makes them an easy target
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can relate to her after i ended school i had so many pent up feelings it felt awful having no friends at all and having never been invited to anything for all those years when i was supposed to grow and feel welcome it broke me and made me question my own identity for years but as i grew older i realized that anxiety played a big part in it just like this girl i never joined events never participated in clubs never really could open up due to the crushing fear of rejection and just like her i hated school with all i had once i left it because nobody wanted to be around me for a reason i couldnt understand it was in the core my fault but it was so incredibly hard fighting it anxiety something i didnt even fully caught on until i was young adult i cant help but feel disappointed in the people who were supposed to help me but never did when i really should be the blame because i was the one who didnt let people in but at the same time can i really blame myself for not being able to fight something i didnt even realized i had
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in my experience people use high school as more of a time period of their life than talking about the establishment of high school i hated high school but i didnt hate my high school i didnt participate in anything that wasnt required i went home any chance i could slept in class pretty much every period before lunch but i liked the actually school i went to but being an asshole teenager i didnt like the time i spent in high school and the to year old awkwardness of it all i had friends and because it was a small town i knew everyone in school as we went to elementary and middle school together all in all the day after graduation i started a job in it and found people that i could get along with in a professional and personal settingi just really didnt like high school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i literally went to grab a fork at the cafeteria turned around and there were guys at my table
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a difference between not caring what a bunch of idiots in highschool think of you and completely failing to develop social skills and i would imagine most people find themselves with very few connections from highschool years out of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and a day later you realize you have minimal social skills and zero connections you only get to this point if you dont change up your methods when they dont workor if you give up completely from selfdefeat point being have no fear in trying new things especially when in high school the consequences of failure while embarrassing are temporary now is the time to see what works and what doesnt work if you can make one good friend you have proven that it can be done if you dont make any friends at least you know a lot of things that dont workthat is how you build your social skills
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right im now in a job that i hate no friends my phone literally has contacts in it my mom my sister my grandma my dad and work no idea how to keep a conversation going even with family and havent spoken to anyone in over weeks other than the usual hi and bye with cashiers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and after three months you go to college and learn you have a second chance at being a new person and none of that shit mattered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,connections i have exactly zero business connections from high school or even my first degree i have a few friends from school still sure but high school is only that important if you die before you graduate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep its a cruel cycle you can go through high school not giving a damn about your social life or you arent even given the chance for one but youre probably screwing yourself over for college i lived it it wasnt fun i was extremely lucky to have found friends who made the first move in college though not everyone will be
UpliftingNews,not_removed,find this is a major issue when you go to college and dont find any friends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not necessarily true and there are other people in the world besides your classmates if you dont connect with them you can seek out rewarding experiences elsewhere by volunteering getting involved in something youre passionate in or taking some early college courses
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea cause its fucking g high school you do t need to make connections there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what if you dont give a shit about social skills and connections the only time my anti social nature has been a real nuisance is mainly when my daughter wants to do school activities and i dread the other parents but from what i understand that is a relatively common phenomenon to the nonsoccermom crowd i have never once used a connection for anything else i might buy this in college if you believe that you need some hook ups for your career but honestly high school doesnt really matter in the grand scheme of things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes bullying is terrible and can still be crippling even years down the line but its also not what im talking about here whilst im sure they do coincide quite often there are also plenty of lonely kids who arent bullied so much as they are ignored and conversely there are kids with friends that are still victims of bullying here im specifically talking about the issue of loneliness and the fact that generally speaking people just arent going to come to you on rare occasions sure you might run into some hero who goes out of their way to include you but in most cases you have to take the initiative im not saying to go crazy with it and try to join the bullies clique or ask out the head cheerleader but striking up a conversation with johnny average or steve from the computer club and trying to find some common ground isnt a bad way to go about it is high school the ideal place for this no not at all its a cesspool of raging hormones and overly stringent and quite frankly bizarre social etiquette but guess what thats where you are and youre going to be stuck there for a few years so you may as well try to come out of it with a friend or two
UpliftingNews,not_removed,crazy makes me wonder why the schools here were basically just glorified prisons in high school we had teachers standing guard at the entrance to the cafeteria to make sure nobody left before lunch period was over and in middle school we often werent even allowed to talk during lunch and each grade had an assigned stairwell that they had to use to get to the cafeteria which meant there was always a traffic jam and if you didnt get to the stairwell in time you wouldnt get to have lunch because theyd close the doors when the bell rang
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i graduated high school in which was the year before they put up security cameras everywhere and made everybody wear id badges i at least had an excuse to roam the hallways because i was in the tech theatre program and our two theatres were on opposite ends of the school so the teachers got used to seeing us going back and forth between them during class but im sure its even more strict now i imagine if they keep having school shootings eventually were just going to end up with tsastyle xray and backscatter scanners at schools and everybodys going to be required to have a clear plastic backpack glad i got out before that happens
UpliftingNews,not_removed,either because they love them too much never saying no to your kid is not because you love them too much discipline is very much part of the picture you never correct them for reasons they are not based on love and yes i didnt mean that it was always the case that they were beaten the piss out of as home my brother would bully me and bully others in school and was never beaten he also had too much power at home and needed more limits growing up its complex but that doesnt mean there arent good approaches
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love french films questce quon a fait au bon dieu is one of my favorites

UpliftingNews,not_removed,but that is such a small part of being alone for which this app is supposed to help when i said i was mostly to blame that had nothing to with bullies it had to do with my withdrawing from the greater social interaction that is highschool the bullying certainly helped to make me withdraw more but what i should have been doing is seeking out others who felt like me you find many of those people in band theater chess computer etc clubs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im actually really sorry you had that experience drummers are usually assholes as for my experience maybe im a little biased because i am one but tuba players are the chillest mother fuckers around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love choir at our school the choir and orchestra kids bond over how much we hate band they get all the glory lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can confirm was a band and theater geek
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty much the wildest parties were always cast parties for the musicals one of the leads parents would go out of town for the weekend and wed all gather there about people usually and rage for hours some of us were in technically exclusive relationships with others but that didnt really matter once the techies showed up with the booze and drugs and at least once things devolved into damn near a drunken orgy i think three couples broke up that night i went to some of the other clique parties because i had friends who played sports or were in sga or some such thing and aside from one wrestling team party that actually wound up spilling over into three houses none of them ever really held up to the performance art kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the loner situation to me really only exists for the kids that want to fit in with the popular kids if you put any effort into being friends with a different group you will find they are almost all very welcoming and great people joining a club or team is a great idea and you will make friends immediately
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats amazing

UpliftingNews,not_removed,its almost as if they have different interests
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well to be honest it might be a local problem and i just assumed it was more spread out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tuba players unite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its definitely the case for me obviously not everyone has the same high school experience but the people you really did grow up with and are from the same home town from are the type of person that you can reach out to even after years and theyll at least be willing to hang out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,any chance of changing careers you still have time and you hate your job anyway

UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like a challenge ill throw something together and see where it goes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,crazy right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it usually only applies to small town kids who end up further living and staying in the same town or proximity for everyone else nope high school is the most random thing you will ever experience in college you at least encounter likeminded people but before that it is simply random and only based on one sharing denominator your parents happen to live in the same region so get along with each other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh im attempting to right now by getting a local trucking job so i can get back to school but past experience tells me its hard to get a job due to my face lol not a self deprecating comment btw i was in an explosion back in the army and an ammo box broke its tie downs and hit me in the face got a fairly bad scar that makes me give off either a thuggish look or a lazy eye or worse im over being self conscious about it but it does make it hard to look professional or friendly and most people seem to be put off of hiring me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i have a cousin who does this ive been looking into it also trying to get into the peace corp somehow but i hear its extremely hard without a college degree so far this has proven true sadly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,growing up i always wondered whether the schools in california were really like the ones on tv because they were nothing like any of the schools here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you do freelance app programming
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they threw barbeque sauce on him and said hey we got the retard who does that what the hell is wrong with some people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was sitting with my girlfriend at the mall when we were juniors in high school waiting for my sister to pick us up when guys walked up to us said hey your girlfriends ugly and walked away i never got the joke shes gorgeous and weve been together years now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some people just get a kick out of being assholes im glad that people were there to make him feel better shit im almost years old and i play the game i have a colleague who is in his that plays i dont go as hard core but i still enjoy the game and i will be buying the new pokemon games that come out if someone is enjoying themselves getting out and not bothering anyone then there is no reason to be an asshole to them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really dont comprehend how some children can be so cruel it just baffles me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is walking distance from my apartment the original news story got posted to our neighborhood facebook group and spread like wildfire the outing was organized by a branch of our facebook group wish i was there but im out of state working not sure if i should be ashamed or proud
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we would have still been hiding in our house like a lot of families like ours do damn thats heavy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pokemon go turns us all into people who walk back and forth and spin in circles how can you pick out someone with autism in a group like that but good for you tempe for proving that love trumps hate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude when your friend acts like an idiot in public and embarrasses you you call him a retard when you see a person with an actual syndrome of some kind you say hey buddy have fun hope you have a great day because dude what the fucking actual fuck some people really do need to be thrown screaming from helicopters as george carlin would so eloquently put it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some people never really grow out of that phase i guess always nice to see people helping people after any unfortunate incident no matter the magnitude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i once made the mistake of poking fun of an autistic boy who went to my high school i was with a handful of people i wanted to impress so i thought id take a cheap shot at someone who i viewed as weird and different they then pointed out that the autistic boy was the younger brother of a girl that was our age who they were all friends with i immediately felt shame and regret that day taught me so much and changed how i view others a year later i ended up having a class with him and some kids were blatantly making fun of him when the teacher stepped out of the classroom he started crying and nobody even tried consoling him i was the type to sit in the back and never really spoke to anyone but at this point i had had enough i stood up walked over to the bullies and basically told them to go fuck themselves admittedly i did it out of the guilt and shame of my previous comments but i dont feel as though that mattered sometimes people need others to stick up for them when they cant do it for themselves i ended up becoming good friends with his sister and i see him a few times a month and have the pleasure of calling him a friend of mine this is such a great story and it gives my home state something to be proud of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a small park by me that has something like pokes tops all clumped together in this little area as a result it has become the goto place for pokemon catching in my city theres easily people there at any given time and because the park is so tiny it makes it look extremely crowded im not exaggerating when i say that every minutes someone drives by and yells something like yeeah pokeman or pokemon suxxxx or faggots play pokemon its become so common that everyone at the park seems to be deaf to it now and no one even looks up anymore when it happens its a real shame though because a good chunk of the players are young kids and theyre being called named by a teenager speeding down the road in a car of course no one ever says anything unless theyre safely speeding down the street
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh god the moms last line got me if this hadntve happened wed still be hiding in our house like a lot of families like ours do i cant imagine the pain of being a mother or father who knows their child is getting bullied and mistreated just for being who they are having to fear that every time you leave the house or if theyre off on their own without your immediate support fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that kid is so bright i really wish this hadnt happened and that he could just live a normal life regardless the aftermath is heart warming and a really great representation of the majority of people in this world edit even the reporters at the beginning are clearly touched wonderful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill never understand people that bully the mentally challenged do they feel good about themselves for fucking with someone that cant fight back fucking assholes glad to see this people stepped up and helped the kid have a good time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for many children with autism and aspergers the bullying of other children is what really holds them back its heartbreaking especially as a parent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it could be worse you could be a year old steroid addled bodybuilder slapping around an autistic guy whos dream it is to be a bodybuilder lookin at you rich piana
UpliftingNews,not_removed,raising my beer to dozens of strangers regardless of the lack of fucks i give about pokemon go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as someone who has spent a lot of time at tempe town lake playing this i find this appalling i have never seen any type of ridicule from the game there personally we have a pretty cool pogo community in arizona so far but this is horrible side note always trips me out to see hometown shit on the front page az
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to any of you people that went out and made this guys day you are awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love this subreddit but damn it it continues to get me all misty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i started getting teary eyed when i saw him jumping up and down with happiness i hope the bullies watch this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,idk why people treat people with autism like shit i lived with aspergers my whole life and living with it is a challenge people with autism have a hard time making friends and are often sexually frustrated due to the lack of relationships they have
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can i just say fuck everyone that bullies anyone thats disabled i saw so much of this during my years of high school and even got into a fight with one when i saw him picking on a mentally and physically challenged kidnothing pisses me off more than this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as a special needs teacher im always sorry when i hear these things not because im better than most but because ive worked with autism and i know how hard is to live with that syndrome these children have to fight everyday to enter in this world they cant learn how we do just observing they achieve goals with a lot of practice so kindness at least is necessary no not necessary is human decency and acceptance on who they are is the best gift to give them go autism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,brought a tear to my eye poor kid didnt deserve that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god it would be fun to get a hold of those guys that attacked the kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i fucking hate people for this very reason haha look at you you have a mental disability hahah lol you mofo fucking hate them why do they need to make fun of people especially when it is something completely out of their control
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it makes me sick to know someone would treat another person like that regardless if you had down syndrome or another genetic disorder no one deserves to be picked on like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sometimes i wonder who really has the disability in these situations honestly i spent hours the other day walking around my city with an autistic guy who just wanted to play pokemon he got real uncomfortable when you tried to talk to him about anything but pokemon his awkward thanks when i complimented his shirt told me that people hadnt always been nice to him for being himself sometimes i just wanna punch people for being dicks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is really heartwarming stuff my younger brother is also on the spectrum pokemon go has created initiative for him to get outside and be more active shame on these shitheads for trying to discourage something like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these are the kinds of news stories i wish i could see more often
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres some real scum in this world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this reminds me of the story where the teenage boy was helping the little girl skateboard even though his friends werent so kind hearted about the little girl being at the skate park some people just make me so cot damn grateful to be on this planet others like the two guys getting the retard not so much major kudos to the rest of the community
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people with special needs are some of the kindest people you will ever meet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my best friend was there im so happy i would have been there too except i live almost hours away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,look at him hes so happy this is so great
UpliftingNews,not_removed,c college aged the fuck the most sociallyclueless jackasses i knew in middle school probably wouldnt have done something like this the hell
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all jokes aside this is a lovely gesture by a community and the group that made this happen shows there is still some decency left amongst our corrupt race hope the boy continues to enjoy the game and hope nothing like this happens to anyone like this again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,every time i see stories like this i think what if that was my child and feel completely sick im glad people came through for him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,evil is quickly vanquished when good people do something everyone that came out for this kid are great examples for us all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this was fucking touching
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its stories like this which remind why i both dislike humanity and like it at the same time how could you be so cruel to target someone with autism its about time we stop excusing this behavior with kids will be kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my son is high on the spectrum so this hits home idk what id do in this situation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just dont get it i love the people who do what pleases them who dont put on a mask of fake pleasure and i feel like those with autism are generally a gift to this world filled with hatred its so weird how people can live with themselves when they insult someone like that it also reminds me of a moment when i took an extra class and there was a girl who really liked talking about her dog everybody was making nasty remarks about her because of that but i also speak about my dog often i brought it up and people said but your dog is awesome but the real difference was that they liked me and disliked her we once had cake in class but there was too much so whoever wanted to have a second serving could grab one nobody felt confident enough to be the first to take a second serving then the girl was the first to get a second serving and she couldnt hide her joy so people started making remarks about how she was fat etc but all i think during those moments is that the people who deserve respect often get ridiculed and this notion keept getting confirmed all around me i think its so unfair when someone gets insulted by people who lack the courage they have
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish people had this compassion when us autistic people fuck up socially
UpliftingNews,not_removed,strangers take teen with autism out fuck people fuck life fuck everyth to play pokemon go humanity is fucking awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did they really need to censor retard its a valid word that is not a swear used incorrectly here since autistic is different than being retarded but its annoying how everyones afraid of the word
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a great ending the last statement of the mother really opened my eyes to families with a disabled child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while i dont like pokemon go because it lures people into my yard this really is uplifting news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,poor guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i was in elementary school there was a tv wrestling move called the thumb if i remember correctly it was jabbing your opponents adams apple with your thumb in second grade lunch time crowded school yard i got thumbed by some anonymous kid it hurt so much i couldnt breathe and went down on my knees i will never forget that and i never told any adult kids are cruel to each other today we can call that bullying but it was kids being mean i wasnt singled out other than being in the right spot for this kid when he chose to do it what the kids did to the boy with autism they probably have done to other kids he was bullied yes but i cant believe he was targeted because of his handicap it is kids being mean i wore glasses so he would have said i got the kid with glasses because that was my most identifiable trait we all do that education will help us stop doing that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man this makes me so happy i would give him a million hugs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i literally read headlines and this and get tears in my eyes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what have people become
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seeing how happy he is makes my heart melt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,should have taken his new found posse out and rolled face
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why just why in what world is that even remotely a sane thought i just dont understand the hatred and cruelty some kids have towards others baffles me props to the people who took them out and looked after them bless you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a beautiful gesture to show up and show support for this family and for your local community people really can when they want to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i def dont like pokemon and clown it regularly but i would never dream of picking on or bullying a kid or someone with special needs for any reason much less bc theyre playing pokemon more than my desire to kick these peoples asses for messing with this kid is the happiness it makes me feel that all these people got together to give this young man a special day not only was he given something pleasant to remember but im sure a lot of good will in general was fostered among the community of individuals who came together to do this great story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very cool to see the gaming community rally what the fuck is wrong with people its
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this needs to be shared everywhere

UpliftingNews,not_removed,after all the negative stories you hear about kids getting robbed because of this game it really does show you that yes this game does have some value of beauty in it contrary to all the negative news reports this game helps kids get out there and explore their world when theyd usually be at home playing their xbox one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,two adults picked onbully a teenager would have been bad enough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if your a bully in kill yourself

UpliftingNews,not_removed,what happens to the bully in these situations maybe theyre doing this shit for attention theyre not getting from parents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in tried to watch but the website is bad for mobiles i hope he is taught to be careful the notion of a young vulnerable teen becoming too trusting of strangers is more worrying than a few pathetic bullies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really glad this wasnt a morbid reality post never know how these types of titles go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love the act of kindness but wtf is pokemon go

UpliftingNews,not_removed,first off retard is not some super secret ultra safe word you cannot say second they werent bullied they were treated poorly in one single instance bullied would be this happening repeatedly by the same person against the same target good to see the community come out and make this kid smile
UpliftingNews,not_removed,karmas a bitch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so they get on the news they all get a pat on the back for doing something any nice human would do anyway then the days after they will get on with their own shit and leave him to be autistic by himself againgreat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,police say one of the suspects was a young male in his early with moppy blue hair and the other was a young woman around the same age with long hot pink hair also they had a bipedal talking cat with them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed why isnt peoples natural reaction compassion when someone has developmental problems i dont think im even a particularly nice or good person but thats even my reaction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as much as the bullying problem has gotten better it amazes me when fucked up shit like this happens i graduated in in hs all the special kids were treated normal we always made them fit in the worst that happened was us laughing at their hyjinx such as a muslim special need a kid sexually assaulting a lunch table the table folding up he was at the end and food flying but the laughing had nothing to do with him being special needs it was funny i can imagine anyone in my school making fun of someone by calling them a retard fucking terrible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,college kids i see this done by high school students but sometimes some people need to grow up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to give you a little context tempe town lake is literally right where asu is which is also by an area called mill ave which is essentially a street full of bars alternative shops and street performers you can imagine all the sorts of tweenie college kids that hang around there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a subset of college aged males that never matured past grade
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some people deserve to be chokeslammed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id love to beat those two shitstains senseless with a sock full of quarters
UpliftingNews,not_removed,two wild squirtels appeared
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,different kinds of retards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it saddens me to say but a good chunk of reddits userbase would be the kind of people to do this if they were brave enough the only thing stopping them is fear of being known beyond a username
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ehh sometimes donald trump gets bored on his campaign stops and he was just looking for some entertainment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,true seriously if i was a witness of this i would have acted on it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,more than likely those kids bullied themselves i recall the chances when i wasnt bullied to pick on ppl and i did i even pulled up to people at a bus stop and asked if they ordered a pizza i than took the pizza and threw it at the person wasnt hot hot but saucy but man i look back and i think what an asshole i was but i look back and i was bullied all the time to do stuff like that stopped right after highschool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was once walking to the bar with some friends when a car rolled up and sprayed me down with ketchup it was a drive by ketchuping no idea who it was or why took forever to get out of my coat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah seriously what the fuck thats like high school bully from a movie level
UpliftingNews,not_removed,team valor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they threw barbeque sauce on him and said hey we got the retard who does that what the hell is wrong with some people hey half the country wants to vote for a guy who is ready to build a wall to keep one religion out and deport million for being the wrong skin color this is all par for the course
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unrelated but potatoes are actually great with barbecue sauce
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jokes on them that autism doesnt even have anything to do with intelligence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont buy it but still a cool story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a for creativity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i swear to god i thought you were joking so i laughed but then i realized you were serious what the fuck is whong with those kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man i thought they had literally said hey we got the rword
UpliftingNews,not_removed,teenagers are the worst
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how does autism bbq sauce retard in the first place i mean if they had said ass burger it might have made a little sense they need to study up on their stigmath
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as someone said this is next to asu and the area is filled with college students who are just coming back now im guessing two kids that did this are fresh out of high school and about to go to asu
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they sound like the retards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kind of a waste of perfectly good barbecue sauce
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some people have no regards for less fortunate ones it really sad what happened with this kid with autism
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people who mind other peoples business
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where is john cena when you need him they deserve a through beat down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,throwing barbeque sauce at people who is the retard here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like something a real retard would do to throw people off his trail
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was honestly confused reading this comment i thought you were talking about the people in the post title
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it wasnt a joke they just wanted to beat you up i know someone who would go to their local mcdonalds after high school football games and do the same thing a relative who did this back in the he told me about it and that he really regrets it but back then his friend group just got a kick out of fighting people any way possible its a good thing you ignored them or they probably would have tried to jump you it had nothing to do with your sos looks they just wanted to find a way to rile you up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god damn it now im worried thats gonna happen with me and i have no idea how i would respond now im thinking of come backs so ill look like oscar wilde if that ever happens
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man if that had been me i woulda did a roundhouse backflip kick on the guy who said that and the force would have popped his head like a pimple his friends would have tried to run but i would have used gear second and chased them so fast they couldnt see me and then when i was standing over all of their corpses i would have punched them so hard that their bodies would turn to ash so there would be no evidence im just saying man if that had been me it would have went down different for sure and then me and my gf would have had hot sex with my huge dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people are so mean all we can do is spread our own kindness and be good to others true happiness right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some little shit cunt year olds came up to my car while my sister and i were sitting at a red light and they yelled through the passenger window youre ugly miss im like kids have you actually looked at me yet my sister is attractive even when shes not next to a mug like me some people are just assholes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems like you missed quite the but your mom moment those are few in life man you gotta take that shit when it comes around
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they were just jealous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they were probably jealous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was at the lure spot in my small town where there are pokestops and the guys would drive around ever now and then and yell shit at the year old sitting on the bench on the other side theyd say shit like what the hell are you you doing with your life old man and you catching pokemon or children you creepy old fuck it pissed me off so much i wish i could say i did something about it but i didnt know what to do i asked him what team he was on to strike up a conversation and he just really embarrassingly said im not to that point yet and kind of shifted to an uncomfortable position that made me think he really didnt want to talk to me it made me really sad i really hope those shit dick teenagers didnt ruin the game for him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i saw a to year old pokéhunter in the wild
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some people just get a kick out of being assholes there are whole communities here on reddit dedicated to it in fact
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the sad part is those werent children they were adults
UpliftingNews,not_removed,usually because they have suffered the cruelty of others empathizing with bullies is probably counter intuitive but i cant imagine a long term strategy that functions without it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i once had to leave schools because of tremendous cruelty only to enter a school where the teachers joined in bullying me nobody ever believed me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,abusive parents due to mental issuesbraindrugsalcohol and kids take the abuse and release said abuse on other weaker kids that appear weaker than him also alpha male trying to impress friends evolution has a long way to go
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,proud two fucksticks were being jackasses fuck them but ten times as many people went out of their way to make this kids day awesome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gotta find those kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its why i dont get out very much id like to but my stress levels go up and i start stimming like crazy a ten year old waving her hands is one thing a year old woman is another
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean tempe is almost nothing but asu and people who have to deal with drunk college students watching people spin around in circles is practically a city tradition
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you can tell hes different just by looking at him i wouldnt be able to say he has autism if i didnt know because of the article but i could tell he was special needs however i wouldnt pick on anyone just because theyre different i know what it feels like to be bullied i had to change schools because of it but still ended up getting bullied
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love trump your true colours are showing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never even grew into that phase i couldnt imagine being such a dick bag to someone let alone someone who is autistic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as the older sister of someone with aspergers thank you i would approach people i knew had been bullying my brother but i couldnt be there to protect him all the time i would have been so happy and grateful to have known someone had stood up for him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was at a wedding last week and kind of ribbing the flower girl she was acting real whiney about wanting a video game and i was trying to be fundistract her the way i would with my own kids she was like she kept like rubbing her hands on me and saying stop talking and id be like no you stop talking my friend was like i usually dont announce this but shes being pretty rude to you so ill just tell you she has autism i felt like the biggest dick hole the things i was doing usually make kids love me but i could now see that i was like tormenting the kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we all make mistakes we wish we didnt make when we are young good on you for having a positive result of it instead of thinking hey this is fun and continuing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you shouldnt worry about it lots of people mock autistic people without even realizing that they are autistic but i learned to ignore it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude when my kid got diagnosed at age thats the thing that scared me the most like id have these images of her being at school being harassed and not even knowing it or being lured in to doing something embarrassing one thing you read is dont mourn things that havent even happened yet dont mourn the future dont make up these little scenarios to break your own heart my kids original diagnosis was the most severe on the autism dsmiv scale requiring the most substantial support last year at age her teacherstherapists decided to remove autism from her iep they said this is the success story every parent dreams of weve never seen a transformation like this shes fine and i cried all those tears thinking about things that never even happened
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what makes this even more heartbreaking for me is that his mom was there she took her son out to play pokemon something fun and active they could do together and some assholes think its somehow funny to humiliate them and ruin their day god damn it it makes me so mad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah its starting to get a bad reputation as a place where bullies and jerks play ive personally yet to see anything but positive interactions but i suppose with the huge number of people who go to tempe town lake to play theres bound to be a few bad eggs still disappointing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it makes me brock
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont blaine me for those tears
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because people fear what they dont understand and they refuse to educate themselves on what they fear so they just stay ignorant and hateful not to mention they love to feel superior and will take any opportunity to put themselves over others man lots of people suck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when youre a lowlife piece of shit you pick easy targets whats an easier target than a person with a mental disability like autism incredibly pathetic people get a kick out of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,heyooooooo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,happy second cake day ustereosync
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that had some great music to it do you happen to know what song it was but anyway the fact that grown people would say things like that is somewhat shocking even generally kind people i would get it if they were children but this is ridiculous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pathetic bullies to the kid being bullied im sure they dont seem pathetic in fact ive heard on multiple occasions of bullies raping and killing kids doesnt get much worse than that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre part of the reason pokevision had to go down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because they singled him out specifically because of his disability it would be pretty hard to describe the incident without mentioning his condition
UpliftingNews,not_removed,too bad bro we are not going anywhere
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i got bullied a lot all my life and i would be so happy if this were me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my climate change its yours please stop the polar bears wont make it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you do realize that this is rupliftingnews and not rbreakingnews right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh dang i keep thinking about this because i troll through the parks and library parking lot to hit the pokestops on the way to and from the gym it must look conspicuous lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these days getting bullied is one of the best things that can happen to a kid im going to wager a guess that any bullied kid would steadfastly disagree with you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damnit you got me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at first i was like damn methheads and then you threw meowth in there xp
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shit i thought you were serious and that he was attacked by hipsters or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well played you magnificent bastard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,police also said they fled in some kind of hot air ballon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,team rocket needs to be put in their place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i immediately pictured every kid ive seen walk into a hot topicspencers with my chemical romance playing in the background and got just so irrationally angry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it bad i thought they were hipsters until the meowth hint
UpliftingNews,not_removed,goddammit take my upvote and go away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really hate how clever that was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you son of a bitch lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those guys always out making trouble
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these three again god fucking dammit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you mean these perps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jessie and james are both p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,took me a while but i got there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,already knew the joke by the time you said molly blue hair
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know you have weird tastes when you dont think of pokemon with that description someone call divine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did they uhyou knowsaid some weird motto too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i got my anime mixed up and thought you were talking about sakura and sasuke at first very confused when i got to the talking cat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed but your natural reaction to any human being should be compassion not just those with developmental problems
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because nobody knows you have a developmental problem unless its superficial to everyone else an hfa looks like a normal person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why isnt peoples natural reaction compassion when someone has developmental problems people with developmental problems can be dicks too theyre people reacting in a certain way by default to someone just because theyre x is bad whether that reaction is meant to be positive or not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why isnt peoples natural reaction compassion i think its evolutionary some people are prone to and seek rewards from violence selfishness and opportunism scavengers bullies alphas etc theyre essentially competitive others are much more cooperative maybe not essentially or innately but like animals that can be domesticated theyre more prone to being socialised than the former and look toward compromise and consensusbuilding as far as im concerned these are interminable virtually impossible to eradicate evolutionary strategies that manifest themselves in psychological and social differences between people and the state that were in of having both groups coexist naturally promotes competition
UpliftingNews,not_removed,peer pressure
UpliftingNews,not_removed,perhaps we should be legally allowed to beat these people with bats until they have an equal level of disability as the person they tormented
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wisconsin class of represent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the problem is with the schools and parents too though if your child is going to fuck a lunch table they should be in a special needs school if theres none of them around then thats a problem obviously
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i live by mill its basically like every college movie ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuckin chads
UpliftingNews,not_removed,asu oh ok now it makes sense out of the people i know who went there are complete assholes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ya your mom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,college aged males that never matured and females definitely not limited to dicks you also get right cunts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh trust me it goes past college and they just get worse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or suplexed by really young but strong girls
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont use quarters fill it up with raw hamburger meat hurts like hell and doesnt leave evidence source have been hit with said sock full of meat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what do you have against sock and the us treasury department
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what if you are dead and they are your punishment for eternity until you can make them realize their faults jesse is using ekans the elation of her sneaking beyond others backs and backstabbing them to rise the poke ladder james with koffing his family being they polute all natural resources with sludge and corporate destruction of anything that can supplant their goals in global domination we are in hell red showed us this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes thats the solution
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the difference is that your wifes retarded cat deserves it seriously ive never met her cat but id probably do the same that teenager didnt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your comment is kind of ambiguous and evil
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stopping illegal immigration is racist now i guess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what the fuck are you bringing politics into this for like what the fuck was that comment supposed to mean how is that anyhow relevant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had chicken potatoes and bbq sauce for dinner it was yummy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill allow it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i was a teen there were some guys that would come up to the beach in my city from the next city and do this every weekend to people once they jumped a kid in a bathroom and then chased him out with brass knuckles running right past a cop when i asked the cop why he did nothing he just said thats your problem well little did these guys know that i too really like to fight i almost felt bad for them but they never came back they should have known not to start a fight with a florida kid covered in boxing scars that was also when the cops stopped harassing me for being homeless and instead calling me the enforcer weird people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is one of those lines i come up with in the shower weeks after the situation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,then they respond with what the fuck did you just say and then everybody gets fresh knuckle sandwhiches
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if your girlfriend has a sense of humor how about which one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice casual homophobia dude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,being able to come up with a response like that on the fly got my ass kicked a few times it makes for a great story after but in the moment its best to ignore people looking for a fight
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well your girlfriend sshe probably she belongs at the uh toilet store
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously though how does an adult respond to some idiot coming up to them and saying hey youre fucking ugly and then just walking away outside is scary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think ulrorak is right that they just want to fight any response however witty would get you jumped dont rise to the bait and explain to your so that shes beautiful and they only said that to get you to give them an excuse to hurt you do it wittily for bonus points
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont worry i have plenty of experience you may not always have a response at a moments notice so i use the chimpape threatening glare strategy its kind of like me grinning at my perpetrator and slightly raising my eyebrows back and forth for those not expecting it it can be unnerving those monkeys know whats up its a great way of communicating i know what you just said and frankly i would like to make your day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am rubber you are glue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,after you slapped on your monster condom for your magnum dong though right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gear second unexpected one piece
UpliftingNews,not_removed,meanness is a reflection of a deeper trouble i know we all know that and am not trying to be condescending but when a kid or young adult is like that they arent just mean theyre suffering and dont know how to express it any other way and i feel terrible for them because the more they lash out the worse they hurt disregarding sociopaths
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because they have nothing of their own going for them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,man reading this shit makes me so sad people act cruel for no fucking reason it sickens me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was new to the game jump in a show him how to earn xp etc i was playing on my sons account he was not with me and yes im an older player and his bag was full i said out loud what do you mean my bag is full i had two people come up unsolicited and show me how to throw stuff out i was very thankful for their help and we had a fun conversation ive since started my own account
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey good on you for trying to reach out to him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that makes me so sad who cares what people decide to do with their time as long as they are enjoying themselves and not hurting anyone else people are such assholes man good on you for trying to help i really hope he sticks with it and finds a group that makes him feel like he belongs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats really sad is how people go out of their way to make fun of a grown man minding his own business how fucking pathetic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hope those shit dick teenagers didnt ruin the game for him nah at around age we all stop caring about anything least of all what some little shitbags have to say its one of the benefits of growing older the opinions of the young become more hilarious than hurtful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats horrible i really hope he isnt discouraged everyone needs to find a way to unwind from the dayforget troubles
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats funny about all of that is this im nearly years old but i still feel as though im just because im doesnt mean some magical thing happened to now i gotta wear dad shorts hike up my pants and be the ever responsible adult and now one day those idiots yelling those things will be my age thinking back on how stupid they were because they dont feel the need to conform to other peoples ideas about them just because younger people think theyre too old its funny that it happens but it will one day youll think to yourself fuck im old but i sure dont feel it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im 😎
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i saw a yo with a walker playing downtown
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cough shit reddit says cough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,adults
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe but some kids are just born cruel and enjoy being in control and emotionally manipulative
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kids also gang up to bully and ostracize autistic children in such cases do you think whole classes are acting out from cruelty
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not always some people are just fucking assholes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right after i asked my friend if people seemed suspicious of her at the airport cause she wears a hijab she said something like im not sure i think everyone thinks theyre being stared at but the truth is no one really cares what youre doing cause theyre all sitting there thinking theyre the one being watched im not articulating what she said very well i hope you get the gist of it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,okay put the pitch fork down he didnt use a capital t
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bleck just watched too much of the dnc with all their signs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ten feet higher
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same even when someone legitimately makes me mad i still feel bad for saying something mean in the heat of the moment i could never understand cruelty for the sake of entertainment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow did you do a lot of therapy change her diet why do you think her diagnosis changed so dramatically so happy for you that you both wont have to struggle as much as she gets older i am a teacher that works with kids on the spectrum and i am super interested if you dont mind sharing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my emotions are surging
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shut the fuck up brock
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks the song is from the youtube audio library dog and pony show composed by silent partner they actually had to cut scenes out to keep within the length requirements for the competition there are so many crazy things that happen to him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup and which is pathetic people with autism are not any less then those without it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i know the kid was psyched and i am sure most people would be i am just socially awkward and when i have a bad day i just want to be alone i dont even want to be around the people i do like
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my bad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,me too 😪
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn meowthheads
UpliftingNews,not_removed,xp for the curveball
UpliftingNews,not_removed,meowth thats right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really jesus what do you want him to be able to get max level or something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just curious how is dyed hair indicative of someone being a methhead im a college freshman and a lot of people i know have their hair some weird color like blue or pink
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was leaning more towards emo tbh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i figured juggalos
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was guessing a juggalo couple
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did they crash after no survivors
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most of those kids would never do something like this the op is alluding to team rocket
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uh those are usually the kids getting bullied to be fair
UpliftingNews,not_removed,suspects had spiky hair with frosted tips and were wearing backwards visors
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well ash is only what ten wow pokemon is really creepy when you start thinking about it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just from the video it doesnt look like he was high functioning even if his cognitive abilities were normal his symptoms seem to be pretty severe given what they called him too it seems like they knew he had some sort of mental disability some people are unfortunately just dicks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my nephew is way over on one side of the spectrum hes a year old genius with emotional capacity of a year old hes such a sweet kid but i can only take an hour of him as hes such a fucking asshole love him though i hang out with him just about every weekend for much more than an hour
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have you ever competed against your enemy for the love of the hottest girl in school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reeeeeeeee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,example one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your honor i rest my case
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have so many questions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oranges in a sock will also suffice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,out of curiosity do you believe building a wall will actually do anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is when supported by xenophobic propaganda saying immigrants are rapists and terrorist is indeed racist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill take what is dogwhistling for alex
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you hear about building a wall to keel out canada
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jesus christ why these downvotes seriously fuck these neckbeards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because people are fucking stupid and they suck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,probably just to illustrate that there are indeed messed up people out there who have no qualms ridiculing a disabled kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im proud of you as well keep up the good fight this world needs positivenicegenuinely good people more now then ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what the fuck are boxing scars i had bruises but scars what kind of boxing are you doing ffs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i believe this story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,weve all been there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh yeah well the jerk store called and theyre runnin out of you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lesprit de escalier
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly people here seem to think the real world is some guybrush treepwood witty bantershitfest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it makes me wonder if the people who feel theyd actually use these comebacks have ever actually experienced a proper confrontation either they are sheltered or lived somewhere where people hesitate to fight for some other reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as an adult i would respond by not caring if they called my so ugly id respond by telling my so that i think shes beautiful so far in my experience the best part of being an adult is not caring a single bit what people other than those you love and care about think about you i look back a how much i cared about what other people thought about me in high school and just kind of shake my head my life would have been a lot easier if i had just learned to not care sooner
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you hitting on me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i honestly would think the dude was hitting on me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id be more worried about what my girlfriend would say back then what i would say she doesnt take no shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so far i can only come up with and youre an insecure little shit whose idea of pleasure is insulting people who are happier than you not really witty but i guess its something
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont thats what makes you an adult
UpliftingNews,not_removed,politely smile and just sort of nod your head a little and keep doing what youre doing my dad taught me this one when someone cut us of driving and threw a drink at our car my dad just smiled and waved at the guy who got even madder because my dad didnt give him the reaction he expected and wanted on second thought maybe dont smile you dont want to piss them off just sort of acknowledge them and move on theyre just looking for reactions
UpliftingNews,not_removed,naw no condom this guy clearly doesnt play by the rules
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not even that plenty of assholes have rich fulfilling lives by trying to make them less than you youre just doing the same thing they are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry for posting a downer on ruplifingnews it really does suck though i bet that guy thinks about that often when playing the game and those ass holes forgot about it minutes after they were done theyve probably spread so much negativity throughout their small world and completely disregarded the ripple that that would cause
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did they have their phone mounted on the frame
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as far as assholes on this site go theyre pretty far down on the list places like srssucks and rundelete are by far worse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no adults
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats the case of my mother she was given a traditional upbringing and for whatever reason she was only happy when people were fighting my mom was adopted when she was months old she grew up had me after being talked out of abortion and then tried killing me several ways the same people that adopted her adopted me and i got the same upbringing and i dont see any reason other than she was just born nasty to act that way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its usually that they dont have positive and constructive ways to feel respected so they maintain status through humiliation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,some people just want to see the world hurt

UpliftingNews,not_removed,at months we began doing speech physical occupational and a general therapist each week at age right before she turned she has a late birthday september we switched to schoolbased therapy she went to a special needs school and was in an autism classroom for years i remember them telling me to send her on the bus from day to establish a routine that begins the day with the bus ride it was better than starting the day with a dropoff in case of panic they could calm the kid on the ride over rather than having a meltdown at school i was like shes two but we did it we went along with every suggestion nothing really ever clicked nothing seemed to improve i know that she was a different kid at school less crying followed instructions seemed more tuned in was willing to try more physical things so i assume they pushed her harder than i could tbh i never thought much of the athome therapy i know i know it looks like play but the therapist would show up with some pinto beans in a bin week after week and id just roll my eyes cause wed already tackled the pinto bean thing lol by the second year of schoolbased her teacher would text me with messages like who is this kid we did cut out milk thats as far as the diet went she has sensory issues for sure shed often gag at the sight of most foods so wed just give her a lot of crunchy dry foods lots of crackers shes still quirky and zones out she has a single stim that no one notices a throat sound i can calm her really well by kind of swinging her and humming sounds on her head ive got her figured out somewhat lol i dont know what happened really it was gradual and then sudden i guess we were all wrong the teachers neurologists therapists i have no idea im so friggin grateful and relieved though thanks for asking keep up the good work too i love her teachers i told them often we became friends id send the bus drivers and janitors and teachers cards telling them how much we love them and thanking them they all did it i barely changed a thing youre doing that for people oh man i love you all for doing the work

UpliftingNews,not_removed,but none i want answers to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i can answer them it tenderizes the meat beating people up works up a powerful hunger which you can then sate with a delicious burger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well ask away
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i live within pissing distance of the border it wont do much we have a fence already and they dig under it you can give cartels shit for being evil but there are some damn smart people involved
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it will make coyotes cost more so yes drugs no also it worked for hungary httpsenwikipediaorgwikihungarianborderbarrierimpactonthenumberofillegalmigrantsenteringhungary impact on the number of illegal migrants entering hungary attempted border entries have fallen tremendously since the barrier was constructed during the month of september there was a total number of migrant entries and by the first two weeks of november the average daily number of intercepted migrants decreased to only which is a daily reduction of more than
UpliftingNews,not_removed,true fuck building a wall imo we should try and get to mars via a base on the moon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if built well enough most definitely do i think its the right course of action no but you could definitely build a wall and drastically decrease the amount of illegals who make it over the border thinking otherwise is just denial
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh my thoughts are their first action on us soil is an illegal one there are a whole host of other problems with illegal immigration as well that arnt based in fear some issues are even based on the safety of the immigrants illegal immigration is a problem it should be solved by giving everyone an actually obtainable legal route though not a wall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the classic i should have saiddone that and it would have been badass

UpliftingNews,not_removed,guybrush treepwood witty bantershitfest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to me i think it is just the fantasy of being able to say something cutting back because in that moment you would feel pretty powerless i know i would not handle a group of assholes saying that kind of thing well at all
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i look back a how much i cared about what other people thought about me supposedly this is part of what a teenage brain is like it cares about peer acceptance because some part of the brain is too large in comparison to the other brain region that should be larger but only gets larger when the brain is mature the teen brain is similarly attuned to oxytocin another neural hormone which among other things makes social connections in particular more rewarding the neural networks and dynamics associated with general reward and social interactions overlap heavily engage one and you often engage the other engage them during adolescence and you light a firesome brainscan studies in fact suggest that our brains react to peer exclusion much as they respond to threats to physical health or food supply at a neural level in other words we perceive social rejection as a threat to existence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,same goddamn i returned to college recently after dropping out as a teen and i know my teenage self would be so pissed at the amount of popularity im squandering due to no longer giving a damn ooh do my classmates like me fuckin i dont care half of em are ironically by not giving two shits i seem to have ended up much more wellknown and admired than i ever was in high school
UpliftingNews,not_removed,babe youre gonna get me an ass whoopin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its kinda cringe material imo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is the sole reason i play this game in my car unfortunately it really takes a lot away from the game when you avoid the places that you have to walk to im and work hours a week and i was at the perfect age when pokemon took off its childish and pointless but it brings back so much nostalgia that it feels good to play it there have been countless times where i could see the silhouette off a magmar or a scyther but didnt go after them because i had to leave the car
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats fucking genius i want one with spiffy pokémon designs on it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sometimes i wonder if people suffer from mental or physical illness unknown by current medical research that causes strange behavior one ex lead poisoning can cause a lot of cognitive issues but who knows some people can just suck edit i typed led not lead lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah im so sorry you had to go through that shes a mean bitch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,leonard you should just kick sheldon out and move in with penny already
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes i knew a girl like this similar to what youd described from when she was a little kid felt pleasure from others pain to make herself look better but everyone really was only nice to her in her face its like they enjoy being in powercontrol because they want to know they amount to something i think some people become like that and some are born like that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sadists
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ash me later how i felt about all of this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but we dont have to make it norman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also i am sorry you got bullied a lot that sucks people are dicks i had one kid that bullied and just that one kid made my life miserable he was two years ahead of me at school my school was but most kids left after grade grade was similar to a pg year for kids who didnt get into highschool summer before grade i was sooooo excited and happy that kid was going to be gone i should have fucking known he didnt get into prepschool and was one of the five kids that was back for grade
UpliftingNews,not_removed,make it double
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wanted this to be real and you have made me sad sir good day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i meant you were giving him too much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was referring to the person who just assumed they were meth heads based off their hair color
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep biff and cassidy were the best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im honestly not surprised there are plenty of douches like this who attend asu from my experience
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well the family or person in charge of him sure were retards allowing the situation reach that far
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i won the heart of a blonde named chrissy back in when i won the downhill comp against a rival skate gang the daggers

UpliftingNews,not_removed,ya got ya grubby mitts on my coat
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think that i could really get around to your way of thinking good show
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why raw just easier or for consistency what is your experience receiving or giving if both why any brands that work better than others what socks work best and why
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i live in canada and work with people from mexico who still have family there and all thy ever say about it is essentially a wall wont do anything as there are more than enough tunnels across that boarder that it wont change anything i imagine if im hearing that here the sentiment is being discussed in places down there too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,serious question who the fuck wants to sneak into hungary and not out
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah well and also the winter prevents people from crossing the oceans and trekking by footpretty sure you can check the numbers and see that in there was a surge during the warmer months of people trying to cross and trek over europe right now there is a year low in number of asylum seekers some places in northern europe no wall implemented on the contrary preparations to receive many was made my point there are probably many reasons for the dip in trekking refugees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but then how do we stop other countries from illegally docking and using our moon base
UpliftingNews,not_removed,define well enough its an extremely long border we catch as many as we do because there are places that are easier to cross in terms of distance and the amount of food and water youd need it just becomes a game of cat and mouse unless the walls are manned or monitored it isnt that hard to get over under or through a wall
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is actually wrong cartels find a way theres plenty of tunnels in use and more can be made
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep all it takes is one sucker punch and all your training goes out the window fighting multiple people only works in the movies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rstaircasewit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,actually not replying is your best solution the guys were looking for a fight anything you say however clever would be an excuse to get testosterone overload

UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was in a similar situation in college on halloween i was broke but wanted to party so for a costume i taped a bunch of aluminum foil to myself and said i was leftovers as i headed to an apartment to drink in my admittedly half assed attire i passed a group of guys that hurled aspersions at me one of them was wearing a michael vick jersey so i shouted and what are you supposed to be gay michael vick side note even then i usually tried to avoid suburban homophobia as an insult but i was pretty drunk they then proceeded to chase me down and beat the shit out of me knocked me out chipped my tooth and broke my nose in three places i was told they were going to try and curb stomp me when someone shouted they were calling the police first thing i recall is chatting with the ambulance

UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpsmyoutubecomwatchvieclsarrbrw
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its easier to hate than it is to love because with love you risk losing something which is why a lot of people who are scared to love because maybe they have lost something its easy for them to go down the road of hate because it takes the pain off of them and puts it on somebody else makes them the object of their hate

UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok i do like this story i live in chicago and i hate that the police always get negative press here but at the same time i have to read this a little cynically this happened in norridge not chicago which is people white african american and has a median household income of they said they were called dec to a bus shelter where a homeless man was sitting with a bunch of blankets he reportedly said he had wanted to board a bus but was told he couldnt do so because he didnt have shoes okay pal here are some boots now get on that bus and gtfo out of norridge

UpliftingNews,not_removed,the officers say the good deed makes them feel good well now you dont say
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the officers say the man expressed his appreciation shaking their hands and telling them he could not go and try to find a job well thats not the greatest typo i hope its supposed to say now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,insisted on remaining anonymous thats a big part of whats lacking from humanity these days everyone who does something decent expects fame and to be showered with shouts of heroism when in all reality we should just be decent human beings because well its fucking worth it i personally despise the guy gives homeless man dollars youll never guess what happens next do good deeds just for the sake of doing them not to try and make yourself out to be a saint
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whoever called the cops on him initially should fuck themselves how can you call the cops on a homeless guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is very good and allbut for a second i thought it said homemade man there was a very brief moment of extreme excitement as i was mindlessly scrolling down my front page start off with disappointment

UpliftingNews,not_removed,can we just knock it off with the whole homeless man does this and gets thishomeless man loses this so x buys him this thing man if you want to be proactive about the homeless then go out and fucking do something i just dont understand what the point of these threads are is it to humanize the homeless okay theyre human now what is it to humanize mankind in general okay theyre human now what is it to make us feel bad because some most of us dont even give the homeless a second glancethought congratulations i feel bad now what is it just some dumb smalltalk story for us to pass on at a fucking cocktail party oh so i saw that these police bought shoes for a homeless man the police can you believe it i guess theyre not all bad after all help me understand what it is you hope to accomplish with this story i was homeless once myself you know what i did answer who gives a fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like this those videos where people give homeless people shit and film it is kinda fucked its good that theyre helping out but the self interest is cringeworthy some kid on my instagram timeline videotaped himself giving a homeless guy some food and posted it to his timeline these cops are doing it right help to help

UpliftingNews,not_removed,so thats what its like not to live in total economic poverty people buy you stuff you need
UpliftingNews,not_removed,believe it or not most cops are like this theyre gruff on the outside squishy and warmhearted inside i know we get to see the really bad apples when they hurt people but the vast majority are like these two in this post
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my friends and i give shoesboots and socks to people whose have worn out at least once a week and generally more often than that this time of year im glad these officers took care of someone but its also a bit baffling to me to see their act treated as exceptional granted none of us are cops but still this is a very quotidian scene sadly enough

UpliftingNews,not_removed,but didnt put him in a homeless shelter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice try but size doesnt exist and they dont sell custom made giant shoes at payless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a shitty thing to do how about oh jeezthis dude is homeless lets buy him a month in a hotel or some shit lets actually do something meaningful because he has no home instead of reminding him that he has to walk the streets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my shoes have the soles worn off can they buy me new shoes too mostly cause im lazy though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is why cops suck wasting taxpayers money on buying new shoes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah really and can we give a shoutout to payless for having a size in stock
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the fact that they asked to remain anonymous this wasnt one of them record me playing basketball with these black kids type moments it was a genuine gesture and thats not always the case they didnt stay unanimous they stayed anonymous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my uncle has a size foot hes like everything from socks to shoes are special ordered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im size wheres my big foot award
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im at in boots in sneakers its uncommon but not that uncommon buying shoes sucks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im surprised that payless shoes cost and that they have size online it shows up to size as a kid this was where my mom would go if i needed shoes and it was hard enough to find something in a normal kid size the shoes were inexpensive fraction of the cost of a pair of nike sneakers vs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its really rare to find a size above i wear a size us and my year old is catching up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone call the history channel cuz we just found big foot sasquatch moved to chitown after watching blues brothers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,still doesnt compare to peggy hill
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont see how its considered a good thing that the police are now doing things that should be done by social workers even the publicity puts pressure on police to do this more often out of their own pay but its not their job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i did this before the guy tossed the shoes because it negatively impacted his ability to panhandle his shoe size was while my puma was
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wear size
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wear a size shoe and let me tell you its very difficult to find anything my size even when i do its always expensive kudos to the officers for snagging a pair for only
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean i rock size hard to find converse let me tell you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they shot him afterwards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do they need to give themselves credit for a good deed on their facebook page
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah if the guy is really hard up for money he might want to consider porn considering what he is packing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they could just give him the box to wear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so youre saying i could have size feet too if i wanted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not having new or clean socks available also compounds the problem nice pairs of socks are one of the best things you can give a homeless person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck yall i wear size
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes got diamonds on the soles of his shoes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not is probably meant to be now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant have the man wear out his new awesome shoes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wat indeed im left scratching my head at this sentence
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so now he can ride the bus but not look for a job life is cruel sometimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you mean thanksgiving at the soup kitchen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we should do everything we can to make homelessness inexistent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,perhaps we should address why they are homeless in the first place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the problem with initiatives like that is that you really cant do much in a day what is needed is continuous work towards improving the problem and a national day like that would probably result in less being done for the homeless people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont even need to do much dont just throw a guy a few coins buy him a hot drink sit with him for a smoke and talk shit for a while most homeless people despite being surrounded by people are very lonely most love to have a little human contact even if that human doesnt then stuff a twenty into their hand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,every day should be help the homeless day unless more than out of your days every year is too much for you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would hope this involved getting them jobs and not free handouts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or you know a decent welfare system so there arent that many homeless people i wonder if there would be any homeless if basic income was introduced im sure there would be a few but many fewer would be sleeping rough
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we already have that a few times a year it doesnt do much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why dont we just fucking help the homeless every day you dumb fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,one of these is not like the others
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy shit do not click the link if you people dont want severe anxiety its fucked up omg i cant believe how those humans were being such bros
UpliftingNews,not_removed,morbid curiosity got the best of me and i tried the last sub hours later im now a changed person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you even uplift bro
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have to say as someone who lives in chicago and not too far away from norridge i refuse to believe a bus driver told this guy he couldnt board the bus without shoes ive seen people use the bathroom on the bus and not get kicked off all that being said nice deed by the officers cpd gets a lot of bad press and not all of it is deserved
UpliftingNews,not_removed,norridge is still pretty much chicago though of people that live there might be white but a significant percentage are middle eastern whom are categorized as white its also near a popular shopping district so its also very diverse
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be fair the chicago police did run a facility where they effectively kidnapped and tortured people to make them confess as recently as only a few years ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a cop if i didnt give a shit id either go tell the guy to not bother people and leave or tell him hes trespassing and to hit the bricks the latter includes the risk of him seeing an arrest as a warm place to sleep and at least one free meal so id probably avoid the trouble ie the paper work involved plus giving a stinky homeless guy a ride in our car and pick the former the really shitty thing to do would be to give the guy a ride to a neighboring jurisdiction and drop him off making him the problem of someone else i would only spend my own money on someone who i wanted to actually help i dont know what norridge pd pays but most of us are making wages that put us in the bottom third of the middle class you dont get my money in a case like this unless i really want to help you edit that the cops wanted to remain anonymous and not get an atta boy note in their personnel file for doing a good deed is more proof this was from the heart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and your point if you look on a map norridge is completely surrounded by chicago they are not buying a white man shoes they are buying a black man shoes so the race stats for the town do not really matter here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha not unlikely people are often generally unkind to the homeless ironically this might be solved by rising unemployment rates once automation starts really taking off again i am actually hopeful of this as the sooner more people have friends and family who are homeless the sooner a solution like ubi might arise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im pretty sure thats actually what was going on the same thing happened in a small town in texas that i used to live in drifters came to town all had mohawks and wore punk attire they were hanging at a resturaunt just drinking water when a cop who was eating approached them to find out who they were being a small town you know whos new and whos not they told him they couldnt leave town because they couldnt afford a bus ticket within minutes that officer had a few other officers pitch in for bus tickets for the three of them i know this story because i ran into the guys right after it happened i was into the same style of clothing at the time and went to ask then where they were from they said it totally felt like they werent welcome and the gesture was more of a passive way to say gtfo
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this happened in norridge not chicago which is people white african american and has a median household income of what the hell does the demographics of the city have to do with anything only thing i can figure is you are saying the officers only care because most of the area is white or they were trying to shove a homeless person out of town because cops dont want them homeless people living near white folk or what was the homeless person in question black i dont know i dont see any mention of the homeless persons race in the article nor a photo is that what youre saying the homeless person was black so the officers wanted to get him out of this mostly white area as soon as possible what a completely odd thing to mention also i get the feeling youre throwing out the median household income to show that this is some sort of upscale area or something median income certainly isnt poor or anything but its about less than the national average were not exactly talking about people living in square foot mansions are driving around in lamborghinis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you just activated by race card in the game of social justice warfare this means total victory by untouchable argument
UpliftingNews,not_removed,intolerant nimby types do that nastiness all the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be devils advocate sometimes people will call the cops for a homeless person because police will be able to do more for them than they will like bring them to a homeless shelter for example theyre not doing to get them in trouble
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if youre talking san antonio the cop was fired and the whole reason anybody knows it even happened was he was turned in by his own fellow cops last i heard the pd ia was forwarding their investigation to the da to determine charges what the da does is anybodys guess but all the shade being thrown at the cops on this really should all go on that one bad cop because its this assholes former colleagues who worked to get his ass fired in the first place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,his punishment should include eating the rest of the sandwich
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what a dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the police are always bad because theyre not bad as individuals but as part of a systemic evil and that goes for good cops good cops are still cops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,almost
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aww that is sweet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we cant solve all problems immediately but individual people can make individual steps this is one problem for one person sometimes bigger solutions start there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,heres some shoes good luck out there bro
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think they make the news because the news is pushing a narrative many stories are even made with false claims but when rebunked dont get trafficked as much as the original story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont be a retard you dont know what every brand and model of police light bars has and doesnt have ive only ever seen them with amber as well as blue so i know for a fact that thats how all of them are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i giggled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,every shoe manufacturer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my soles always wear out first
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wore holes in the soles of two pairs of shoes last summer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does this apply to penis sizes too because everyone keeps telling me their penis will penetrate my mother
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we are trillions of dollars in debt we cant be the richest in earth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck off
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sure if you buy them a nice dinner one will let you do that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,by that logic why not buy pairs for people in need
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty sure that was a typo and is supposed to be now instead of not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a charities whole purpose is to go out and do this stuff these officers used their own money and did something good and so what if the charities dont get a ton of news coverage they shouldnt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you have a spark they used their own money to do this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they cant force him to go to a shelter we have a big homeless epidemic where i live and all they can do is offer to take them if refused they cant do anything more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lovely individual
UpliftingNews,not_removed,talking like this makes you no better than the rednecks of the kkk accusing an entire workforce for the actions of a few just as others accuse an entire race for hte actions of a few yea there are some guilty officers out there realistically if they were all this corrupt many more of us would be dead already stop feeding into the propoganda and think for yourself on who to actually hate realize who is actually your enemy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get fucked
UpliftingNews,not_removed,free stuff is free stuff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i regret scrolling down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,waitshutout or shoutout
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah its pretty neat that all of the cops involved unanimously agreed to do something good e i know
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my neighbor called the police on me for shoveling their snow because they thought a company was doing it and they would receive a bill they couldnt afford to pay i was already upaid at am and the old guy who lived their had a heart attack that year and it literally took me less than minutes to shovel his sidewalk and walk way it was nice for me because the police officer had his friend come by in a plow truck and let me get cat litter buckets of salt for his sidewalk and walkway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats what i like about this too all good deeds should be done without praise or publicity just do it cause its right very inspiring
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i completely agree with your statement
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anonymous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its important to remember people do good gestures all the time that we dont hear about
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anonycops
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt know cops had soles
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you think its bad that cops want to film themselves making friends and having fun with the local kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the entire stay anonymous thing no more good is done by example
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell me about it i have a size foot and cant find shit to wear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell him a strange person on the internet said hes short size reporting in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im size and its where ive been shopping for years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it varies deeply by brand i range from a my climbing shoes are tight and my boots have extra room for socks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,even me at a size it can be difficult sir i do not envy you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,weird question are you well endowed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive only ever seen a as a translation from a european size maybe or a would be perfect for me i wish they sold them at payless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they dont make i wear because my real size is nearly impossible to find pretty much nobody even has size of in anything let alone by the way i was downvoted for pointing that out elsewhere in this thread
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey pal i just wanted to say thank you for doing anice thing sort of related but we had a jackass like this at my local store who would complain and trash talk people in his native language and he was just recently fired i know the store owner and got him kicked off the night shift by telling her he wasnt doing his job at night and i guess someone else finished the job or she got sick of babysitting him during the day shift sometimes talking to a manager really does help
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it wont help with the size penis though sorry i tried and it didnt work
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no shoes no service goes both ways d thank you maam thatll be okay here wait are you in your socks what the hell im out of here not wearing shoes this place is so weird im also reminded of louis cks old bit about the drivethru as a pedestrian
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and lets all be honest with ourselves he aint going to go look for a job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no soles on your shoes means you cant do manual labor which is probably the kind of job he would be looking for it was probably a typo the writer most likely meant now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how would he get hired if he walked in looking like a bum with no soles on his shoes he wouldnt you shouldnt judge this person based off him being homeless this man could be a vet with ptsd
UpliftingNews,not_removed,autocorrect journalist just typed up the story quickly and pressed spell check no red words good to publish
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i used to live in the tenderloin in sf and i was used to the normal line for the glide memorial church free food they had some event right before thanksgiving and there was an entire city block end to end wall to wall with homelessneedy people i cant estimate crowds for shit but im confident saying it was in the magnitude of thousands
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i mean people actually going out of their way to seek out the homeless and help them in some way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean some people have family so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,were just gonna killlll emmmmmm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right its super nice and all but its like the smallest of band aids for the larger issues of our culture
UpliftingNews,not_removed,write your congressman or mp a physical letter they dont give a shit about emails every letter they get they assume represent actual people in their jurisdiction and thats votes even better start a letter writing campaign in your district change starts from the group up let your local politicians know if they want your vote they need to take action in this area
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ask your cities
UpliftingNews,not_removed,perhaps we should address why they are homeless in the first place are we not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats an extremely difficult problem to address though no one has much of a handle on mental illness and addiction
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh fine ill do days from now on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok take it the wrong way but all i was saying was the nation could use that but if you wanna go spouting off like youre a damn saint be my guest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,where
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah only one of them is focused around memes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a fear of driving walking down the street riding my bike and just fucking existing now dont watch the brick video though its not graphic at all but the audio im scarred for life from that one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you even uplift bro i know i know i thought about that ¯ツ¯ there is still an uplifting angle though thanks to the actions of these police officers there will be fewer homeless people in norridge this one heroic act might actually have eliminated homelessness in norridge so theres that today norridge tomorrow barrington eliminating homelessness one village at a time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a meme that shouldve stayed in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive seen people use the bathroom on the bus and not get kicked off isnt that why busses have bathrooms unless you meanthis was on a bus that didnt have a bathroom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i wonder about that white stat i grew up on the far nw side and it might have been correct in the but a lot of hispanic and middle eastern folks have moved in the area would have thought those numbers would have dropped a bit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok officer i confess your momma is a filthy whore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dude thats bizarre to me i mean its counterproductive as hell granted i havent been a cop for a long time now but just a little human kindness towards the homeless population and theyd tip you off to all the actual bad shit and bad people no better street level intel network than the folks that are everywhere see everything and go completely unnoticed by everyone you want to solve that straightup whodunit with a body in the alley fuck surveillance video you pray there was some homeless dude behind the dumpster half a block down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,norridge cops are definitely not in the bottom third of middle class in salary not getting rich but do pretty well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the latter includes the risk of him seeing an arrest as a warm place to sleep and at least one free meal so id probably avoid the trouble ie the paper work involved plus giving a stinky homeless guy a ride in our car i cant imagine the kind of situation someone must be in to be willing to get arrested so they could have some shelter and food for a little while on top of being thought of and treated poorly or as if they were invisible on a daily basis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly norridge might as well be chicago in fact i believe in the late harwood heights and norridge tried to become part of chicago those areas are pretty much extended parts of the nw side
UpliftingNews,not_removed,careful with that logic ubi isnt the be all and end all ultimate problem solver that income is coming from somewhere hence some government agencygroupwhatever are actually in control of it if ubi exists under the current reign the people should fear it as it will be leveraged against them in due time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ubi will never succeed its far too idealistic and not at all realistic i dont even think it could be passed in congress american culture is all about individualism we cant even convince a majority of people to help foot the bill for each others education or healthcare how are we supposed to pitch an idea like hey could you pay me to be alive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck that we need birthing licenses and child quota caps before we just start paying people to shit out kids and exist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so now cops shouldnt do anything to help people who outright say theyre having some problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or he was just using the facts he had stated to point out it was an affluent neighborhood but nah hes just being racist right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or you could be following the narrative that police officers are mindless monsters and that we have a race war instead of a class war but hey enjoy your safe space
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pretty saddening
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i seriously doubt this is the case he was probably forced to relocate from the bench he was sleeping on because people really need to sit on those benches while they wait for the bus
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how can you earn that much money and not have housing i ask because i own a housing unit that charges weekly and a days work would make you enough for a weeks rent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shoes a good bag or two and a listing of information for resources is always a good start
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well there certainlyis some truth to that but there are still too many bad cops with monster egos or those who were bullied in life and become cops to get above others
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah and where exactly in ohio do you live states have regulations for signal bars and its pretty much a national standard with exception to hawaii also if you do some extremely simple research the answer i came up with before you shotgun replied an answer would of made you think twice before making yourself look like either someone from out of the country or a neckbeard that still gets driven around by your mom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes but it only applies during business days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lots of people including myself use their own money to do something good as you put it no suspicious recordings of us making their way to the news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but the point is that this isnt uplifting at all hes been homeless for such a long time that the soles of his shoes have been worn to the point where they are useless so they bought him new boots come on imagine yourself as him and just think of what he must think of the local police force right now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,talking like this makes you no better than the rednecks of the kkk this is a ridiculous thing to say whether you agree with him or not you know what the kkk is right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not really about whether you love cops or hate cops its about a group of people with institutional power and a command structure which doesnt officer incentives and effective tools to deal with wrongdoing if we could confine the discussion to that and avoid invective i think wed get a lot more done
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if by propaganda you mean police shooting innocents and getting away with it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes but id take shelter for a month with an air conditioner in a hotel room over a free pair of shoes any day protection from the elements and from other humans is a bit more important than decent foot coverings which i could construct from items i find in most garbage bins plus most people dont know this but ifyou approach stores near closing time and tell them hey if you have any mis matched shoes that you cant use i could use them when i collected for hurrican relif for jamaica in the later thats what i was mostly given from stores like beneton fashions etc etc they would give me xxxl shirts or shoes that were only one left of one kind and only one right of another kind but if theyre in your size then who cares if they match or not same thing with fast food if you approach the restuarant from the back door where they t ake the trash out and waitand when the worker comes out with the trash say hey man do you mind if you pass a word along to your manager i knowyou guys throw away a lot of burgers at closing time that are just sitting under the heat lamp i m homeless can i have them instead of the trash can i used to work at burger king this happened a lot thats how i know
UpliftingNews,not_removed,definitely shoutout i fixed it im using a keyboard and ive never made more typos in my life im so confused
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shootout
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i wear a and have learned i dont get to shop for what i like i just have to go ask what they have then choose from atrocities its usually only a pair or two to choose from then goodness for online shopping
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he probably saw something on news about those people who prey on elderly like that theres people who literally knock on the door afterwards asking for money they know theyll usually pay up sick people luckily theres more of you around than them even if the news makes it look otherwise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he came with a plow and didnt plow it thats some sadistic shit right there but good on you for that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not a christian per se anymore but it reminds me of a nice verse from the bible that says when you give dont let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not simply a matter of how large or small the number of unjustified police shootings is its a matter of racial disparities in being stopped by cops especially without cause the likelihood that an individual killed by the police was unarmed and judicial sentencing as well as several more fundamental questions about the existence and purposes of a police force at all that is whether it is desirable that a authoritarian power has the generally recognized or authorized capability to use force on the people it presides over in order to maintain society as it is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no i dont think its bad its just not as touching
UpliftingNews,not_removed,call up shaq to see if hes got any from his tween years still lying in the attic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what size is your other foot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a size and its where ive been shopping for years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my size feet are all the bigger i want ive seen the selection of bigger shoes and it sucks you have my condolences
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id say average its a common misconception
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whats the scale on a scale of is too small and is too big sounds juuuusst right also thats probably good it didnt work your lady friends probably dont want the rear wall of their baby factory jack hammered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its true that many homeless would like to work im sure having new shoes isnt the only thing keeping the guy from getting a job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont know that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,homless people are stuck in a situation where they cannot find a damn job they have no resume they have no place to live no adress thats why they should build those small micro houses for them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah they crank out these pro police puff pieces like hot cakes no time to proof read much less fact check
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh im ready for ai to take over
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all homeless people are mentally ill and addicted lol okay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you dont have to go that far its just that you are fucked if you cant get another job and dont have savings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,christmas thanksgiving etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep made that mistake killer username by the way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,weve got a quiet community here mr no shoes and we dont need your bare feet stinking it up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good luck driving that one guy from the exit ramp at and golf hes been there for decades
UpliftingNews,not_removed,until theres just one town in the us full of homeless people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to make this ¯ツ¯ copypaste this ¯ツ¯
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the uplifting angle is that norridge doesnt have a homeless problem anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey i lived in barrington are you from there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a meme that shouldve stayed in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive never seen a city bus that has a bathroom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the cta public transportation buses dont have bathroom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed i would have thought hispanics would consist of especially seeing how diverse nearby areas like jefferson park are
UpliftingNews,not_removed,having watched some old mystery serials they would stick in episodes where the best informants were on the fringes of society i actually got a kick out of movies where the detective or cop who busted a person long ago and sent them up was now friends with them ie charlie chan and nick charles from the thin man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,huh ive never seen it put that way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how did you come up with that conclusion i just told a story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or he was just using the facts he had stated to point out it was an affluent neighborhood median household income is considered affluent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he lives in a house but being homeless pays the rent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know him and you dont either i dont know if that was a small problem or a big one but it was one that the officer felt capable of addressing shoes are a big deal its not coverage its the ability to get about to get to a shelter to be allowed to enter many fast food places possibly even to get to a possible job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup but not as many as youd think the broken black communities where the problem originates from on the other hand
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry im still confused article says the debt isnt much too worry about but not that we are the richest on earth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck off and make a post detailing your shit theres a reason everyone dislikes your comment fucking pick up on it no this isnt truth this is petty bullshit youre pathetic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone else took the photograph and submitted it the officers didnt even want to be recognized
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hate when people perform small acts of charity if youre going to do it it needs to be big otherwise its useless lets just stop then right if you cant buy him a bloody house then why even bother shoes wont help anyone because even with new shoes hell still be homeless so he wont care about the new shoes hey so much for making someones day right if you can improve someones life even just a little bit then you should do so
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honestly i think he thinks better of the police force kindness goes a long way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is one of the most entitled things i have ever read
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes which is why if you continue to read the sentences following the one you picked here could see in the context it fits
UpliftingNews,not_removed,by propaganda he means few incidents occurring and the media making seem like the norm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the police is taking money out of their own wallets to help this guy if the homeless are going to complain about free items they should stay homeless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what does you two dollar keyboard have to do with it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,me too these switches are super sensitive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stealth boast who cares how much it cost
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have bad feelings towards you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have also had bad feelings towards you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea but this was after the time i get multiple houses now near me since im already dressed in my thermals and snow removal clothes also my next door neighbor had a heart attack this year and the guy across the street and house down had
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are not sickthere irish and the they need to pay for there caravans somehow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres people who literally knock on the door afterwards asking for money they know theyll usually pay up i find it out that they end up paying for that what i would say is i am only owe you my thanks nothing else i would have been fine paying you if you would have asked before starting the service though if you also want to cause trouble the police can get here in minutes or i can call the morgue in under minute i just find it odd that the elderly dont really stand up for themselves i can see if they are years old but i know many that would do the job themselves and can be a pain in the ass when you offer to help
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plow truck with a salt spreader on the back those are for streets and not sidewalks and small drive ways my brother has a large drive way so i gave him my large snow blower i bought dirt cheap in an auction over the summer years ago i was going to do the snow for the block but it was just too large and not really made for snow under inches it was something like but i got it for plus in fees
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres a lot of good advice in the bible a lot of information on how to be a good person unfortunetley theres a lot of bullshit that was put in there for the higher ups to control the little people and to keep disenfranchised people women minorities etc down but if it does have some great stuff if you can separate the wheat from chaff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in america yes in other parts of the world not so statistically rare still does not mean you should relax or let down your guard because there are groups continuously looking to do harm to americans if they had the means nukes and other mass bombs would be frequently happening no problem dealing with minor delays in air travel for an increased percentage in safety would hope we get mass body cams for cops soon to end ambiguity and bring forth justice and personal responsibility on both sides of the coin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,on the us shoe scale also b width none of that cheswick eeee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the scale would require girth also a for example
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like to think its us vanity sizing like with womens dresses a size is actually a pounder a size is a healthy average size
UpliftingNews,not_removed,next up curing him of his conversations with inanimate objects edit downvotes for a harmless joke the pc police are on the lookout apparently
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for your service i respect vets and it saddens me that so many are homeless i still think he should be able to get help and not stuck on the side of the road if a vet with ptsd gets help but still has no shoes he probably isnt going to have a job also just out of curiosity what military branch where you in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nsfw
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a huge percentage yes ive been a cop for a decade so i have been in contact with a few
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i meant a literal day for it the other ones its not at the front of most peoples minds to help anyone but their own family and friends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not sure if deblasio still does supposedly to save tax money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was thinking austin was headed in that directionthen went to san fran and portland i stand corrected
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wellnot a bathroom bathroom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats another area which back in the was just as lily white
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because thats not how your story is phrased at all you literally start with implying the cops were trying to be dicks by helping and telling a story where when a cop helps someone with a problem they assume it was because theyre assholes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,norridge is very much middle class
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not as much as the media lets you believe a lot of stories turn out to be biased and riddled with real fake news like how brown was an innocent kid id take what you hear from the mainstream news with a grain of salt especially after they have been found out lying and manipulating so many times you are right that it happens but nobody talks about the rampant black on white crime or black on blue crime even though that happens a lot more that is because its not pushing someones agenda not saying you should wear a timfoil hat but dont blindly trust the media either
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that isnt moderate at all and you need help you can be happy with out drugs it just takes time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you spoke about the debt so i pointed out that despite how huge it is it doesnt appear to be that big of a concern for richest on earth check this one out httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofimfrankedcountriesbygdp you can click on the headers to rank them by size the usa tops the chart for gdp nominal and is around place for gdp per capita if you look at the gdp ppp the us is in place ppp is a value that represents purchasing power its considered more accurate to judge standards of living for gdp ppp per capita the us drops to place which i believe hints to the large disparity in income in the us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i read that also
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant understand why its entitled elaborate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the kkk did a lot more than accuse a race of things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you appear to have a learning comprehension problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i use a corsair rapidfire and the switches allow keys to be pressed in at a shorter distance than most keyboards or at least that is how it feels my keyboard is super sensitive to the touch because of this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha i went from a free dell keyboard to a razor blackwidow chroma if im fully honest i hate the feel of it but im sure i will get used to it ive just been using the same pos for like years this thing is insanely loud it sounds like a typewriter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt pay that much for it i bought that shit off a rich kid after christmas i dont know anything about keyboards and am simply observing how i prefer the feel of a keyboard that costs less you alright brah
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have responded similarly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn where do you live heartattauckland
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it isnt like we might have a reputation for stealing ladders dont even mention caravans youll summon them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is that an irish thing never knew would have associated caravans more with gypsies
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am currently unemployed and struggling to find any job in my mid at the advice of pretty much everyone went door to door asking to shovel driveways and sidewalks got a bunch of fuck offs get a real fucking jobs what are you fucking and door shuts and a lot of threats of calling the police anyway seeing as you feel the need to threaten these people with death im going to guess youre one of those people who wouldve just slammed the door in my face anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,riamverybadass
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think the idea is to convince them they already agreed to pay and forgot because they are old in the instances where they pay my guess would be the its because they are unsure if the forgot vs unwilling to stand up for themselves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are good people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well heres some wheat some folks may neglect if one sizes up christianity by the new testament far too many like to site the law of the ot in their criticisms of christianity then one should know there are many injunctions to respect outsiders or the sojourners and not to shut them out knowing what exactly a samaritan was in those days makes the parable of the good one all the more significant in fact jesuss lineage not that genealogies should ever matter as st paul warned contained a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiruthbiblicalfigure likewise there are far too many injunctions that insist on helping the poor and the least matthew for starters while rather demonizing the rich the letter from james is not too flattering when jesuss apostles abandoned him only the women and the apostle john but i have a rather wild speculation about him being possibly a tad autisticalmost a living bible destined to live a long time chose to stand by the crucifixion now just who were the first to be privileged to witness the what many online would call the supposed resurrection yes women that speaks volumes just by its profound depiction there heck a lot of the scribes assisting the apostles were women there were also women who were prophets and were warriors in the ot so their contribution is indispensable to the christian faith though we are asked to follow laws those laws that do not infringe upon christian teachingthus it is better to serve god than man and if it means harboring the persecutedie during nazi occupied europe then so be it and those within the church jesus does dismiss in fact the secular attitude of hierarchy and asks the leaders to be ministers that is to say servantsmatthew the bible also warns heavily of the many wolves and false teachersbrethren who spy out liberties and burden people with laws so yes it is a given that to this day that many of the most prominent evangelical faiths are flimsy hustles and cults run by men who exploit and constrain the vulnerable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as in d cell batteries im only about if thats the case
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,makes unfunny joke at the expense of the disenfranchised gets downvoted damn this pc culture
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats because you are only seeing the homeless who look like they live in a dumpster someone who is homeless and trying to get their shit together generally try and stick to some personal hygiene
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a lot of homeless are mentally ill and try to self medicate with drugs its unfortunate that there isnt more help for mental illness that isnt just locking them up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lmfao
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hah i didnt want to add too much to the joke but i really wanted to follow it up with we should just use san francisco half our work is already done
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well typing off a phone and i dont care
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh im pretty happy right now though i really do like living out of my van and i dont mind my drug habit im ive seen and been through it all i choose this life for a reason
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow this is awesome you learn something new every day thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nobody gives a shit about your retarded bullshit this is upliftingnews go and fuck up someone elses post these two cops did a great thing no amount of your stupid whining is gonna change that you are equivalent of the westboro baptist church picketing a funeral to push your agenda you delirious piece of shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wtf are you trolling on about this guy wants to demonize every single police officer because of the actions of a few there are many good innocent officers anyone who promotes hate of an entire group of people simple for how they look is simply a pos
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just wanted to make you look to see if you had messed up again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but is it rgb
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they advertise the switches as having actuation point rather than so i guess thats the point of the rapidfire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what switches are you using
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trust me it might feel weird for a day or two but once you get used to it you can never go back to membrane keyboards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit nongamer guy buys black widow chroma for day trading and prefers feel of era dell footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you havent even touched the surface of great mechanical keyboards yet just wait till you upgrade to a planck or rmechanicalkeyboards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you need to get yourself some of they make a hell of a difference to the noise of mechanical boards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,try to find an ibm model m best keyboard ever granted it is ugly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not a bro but ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,indeed fellow human
UpliftingNews,not_removed,were prefer it be called the midwest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youd think that but i just have older neighbors neighbor next to me is just overweight a bit and was doing some construction around his home
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gypsies are irish
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seems more likely you should understand the problems with someone coming up and demanding money for a service you never asked for doortodoor sales is a lot of rejection but racketeering is a crime
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you could always try calling the local snow removal companies ahead of time and see if they have any openings for their crews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the point being the only people i see doing this would be ones who wouldnt mind getting rough sorry for keeping myself safe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess that is a possibility i cant personally say if i will continue making sure i have paper trails for everything to cover my ass in any situation when i am up there in age i can only hope i do so no one takes advantage of me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it wasnt a great joke but it was just meant to be tongueincheek not a joke at the expense of the disenfranchised dont trip too hard over yourself in your fight to make yourself feel superior to others
UpliftingNews,not_removed,trump chimes in lock her up lock her up lock her up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know i meant it as an example i dont think we have a race war as much as a class war and the white cops shoot all the black people is just a smokescreen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are welcome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this was fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea ill stick it out for sure the macros on this thing are awesome i actually dont game that much and use it for day trading i can set up different illumination and macro profiles that automatically change depending on what app i have open but i cant go sentences without a typo and im pretty sure my nbr can hear me typing this thru the walls i need a macro for spellcheck haha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive got a cherry mechanical keyboard for a couple years now still dont know feel the difference to the cheap logitech ones i used before
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nongamer guy buys black widow chroma for day trading and prefers feel of era dell keyboard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they actually hate gaming mech keyboards especially razer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never thought that me being confused would lead to having another subreddit join in but then i remembered that this is and im on reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh nice ill look into it right now thanks i actually find its the clicking thats loud not so much the bottoming out of the keys do o rings still help with that or would i have to change switches to get it quieter edit im pretty sure it still helps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,classic ive deffly owned a few of those back in the day pwned a couple noobs with that thing in cs for sure i wish i had the foresight to hang onto onei just checked and cant believe ports are still made on mobos even tho is super common
UpliftingNews,not_removed,see now this is all kinds of suspicious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not american but is texas the midwest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gypsies are romanian travellers are english irish most are associated with the irish though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,put in apps for the ones that called me back got turned down for no experience
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol its ok bro ive made tons of jokes that didnt land before sometimes you just read your audience wrong yknow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so theres a class war and some of the classes just happen to enjoy tanning a little too much you seem smart enough but open your fucking eyes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are absolutely retarded its unreal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plz post as described if not i have to steal your hilarious headline
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for a good reason too im looking for a mechanical keyboard at the moment i game a lot but most gaming keyboards are shit for their prize especially razer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a razer blackwidow is the only keyboard ive ever managed to brick and subsequently also the only keyboard ive ever snapped in half over my knee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh i didnt know o
UpliftingNews,not_removed,having another subreddit join in im not quite sure what you mean
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think theyll still help quite a bit and theyre not very expensive hope they do the job for you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i bought my mobo for the port im surprised i found one that has ram slots for and i am not much of a techie but i wonder what else uses or if the ibm model m keeps it relavent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha why would this be suspicious i am normal functioning human like u guys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,america only has three regions new york las angeles and the midwest
UpliftingNews,not_removed,texas straddles the border between the southwest and the south
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the ones round here dont travel much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea i always thought so the romanian part didnt know the rest thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think its more that theres a vocal minority of people like yourself that expect humor to be convenient and feel good and that theres a dark humor within daily life that many people are uncomfortable with so they choose to feign umbrage
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as in that the media manipulated that and riled up the riots just to get clicks the problem is still the broken black communities first and foremost
UpliftingNews,not_removed,right back at ya you seem relatively smart as well so dont give me the tanning nonsense you know what i mean we have some race problems but most are blown out of proportions or they only show what they want to show most hate crimes is black on white we have a class war and this is a nice smoke scream remember we can have both
UpliftingNews,not_removed,haha its all yours
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a cold blight is savaged by a warm light i triple dog dare you to pm uharrybahlsack with tidings of a better tomorrow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your tail light is flickering again sigh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not true we also have the south i live there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love this pitbull song
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its the term we use for them but theyre usually associated with caravans and travel alot horses are common too wiki is your friend if you want more info
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok i guess thats one way to look at it another way to look at it would be that humor is subjective and what one person thinks is funny is different from another person but hey dude whatever im sure youre a very funny dude irl i wouldnt actually know
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know what i mean no i dont know what you mean dont talk to me like im on your side where do you live that you have such a broken view of the world
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i never asked for proof i told you to gtfo with your retarded paranoid bullshit this is rupliftingnews this isnt rdickheadinthecommentsexplainswhyeveryoneisawful stop trying to argue i am telling you to get fucking lost i dont care about your argument nor your goals nor your points nor your opinions dont act like im holding a point opposite to you because i am not i am not holding any point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fantastic way to go mobility and staff
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this subreddit really needs to be renamed rupliftingnewsthathappenedafterreallyfuckingdepressingnews damn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,truly a bittersweet story such a tragedy the family will never be the same
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so glad the officer on the far left decided to be the only one to dress up as batman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,awww this is great to hear such a tragic story here in wi this story is huuuge
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope they bought him a big plate of ribs or pork chops afterwards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,too long how about rulntharfdn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh that just breaks my heart he looks so cute in his costume and no doubt was so excited to trick or treat with his dad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not a costume
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt even see him until you said he was there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,really
UpliftingNews,not_removed,way to be a dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you shouldnt lump a large group together based on the actions the of a few no one is saying that a policemanwomans life is more important you said it this is a story about doing something nice for a child that lost his father
UpliftingNews,not_removed,be careful you might cut someone with your edginess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah by you dehumanizing them youre part of the problem
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you heartless bastard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant wait for the day that you need emergency help and realize you need them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you know officer down is more important than us there is also a reason killing or assaulting an officer carries stiffer penalties they love themselves first and foremost keep downvoting doesnt change the fact these officers were not out helping your community instead of upholding the blue line
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and hes not a cop
UpliftingNews,not_removed,true point taken
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i see your point not my intention to demonize as a human but the force as a whole
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell that to all the kids without parents gunned down by police wonder if cops showed up and helped them oh because the blue line doesnt fade self rightous dbag
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for the orginal flavor of your comment cunt taco im sure your parents proudly remember the day you died in that house fire
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill call a crackhead thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sure in around or near your mother
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for for seeing my point not about his death or his kid its skwed story posts and the fact theyve gunned down it feels like misinformation to not state facts however offputting i made it i was lazy should have made more sense
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes a watchful protector
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how the hell is this uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,seriously uplifting how
UpliftingNews,not_removed,family doesnt have to buy her food anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,turkey our ally will still bomb them regardless
UpliftingNews,not_removed,woow respect for these women but yes dirty politics trumps any morals every time these days
UpliftingNews,not_removed,heh uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read elsewhere that cost of the surgery is but that the hospitals are paying for it and the doctors donated their time his is the penis transplant the first was a failed attempt in china in the second in south africa in this recipient went on to father a child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i woke up this morning with a bad hangover and my penis was missing again this happens all the time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i guess he can say i wouldnt hit that with another guys dick with more conviction than most
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope this guy is left alone by the media i am sure there are idiots out there who feel that they need to know every detail about the structure and function of his new penis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this mustve been hard on him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,was the reason it was the first us penis because the others before him all bought african penises
UpliftingNews,not_removed,id imagine hes going to have a pretty cocky attitudeif ya catch my drift
UpliftingNews,not_removed,iit a bunch of commenters being dicks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you have anything in a ron jeremy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thumbs up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe it will seem possessed and have a mind of its own oh wait that happens anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the sub says uplifting but the snoo on my frontpage says
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did he at leastyou knowupgrade
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill get inches doctor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but does it rise to the occasion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he can finally stand on its own now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its detachable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what is unbelievable is how fast it went from missing to be on the black market though it is not specified it could have been the antique market
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he can also say first
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how come
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont know why this isnt upvoted more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those are discontinued but we have a johnny castle you might enjoy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill just leave this here httpimgurcomymrkoad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you look in the medicine cabinet because sometimes i put it there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like a missile a king missile
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ieds blow up from the ground up so they have a tendency to rip off dicks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dam
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh that sweet baby i cant imagine having a child with so many health issues i hope his conditions improve and he and his family can enjoy life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,titles like this are known as inspiration porn and are pretty offensive to most disabled people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that was pretty uplifting up until the part where the raccoon died after taking a few steps
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rdownloweringnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the best thing to do would probably euthanize it while its in the drain because its already in so much pain and under so much stress
UpliftingNews,not_removed,animal euthanasia comes to mind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so in reality the most humane thing would have been to shoot it and and then get it out of the pipe so its not causing a clog instead it was scared and suffering while people wasted time money and effort to dig through a parking lot to save a raccoon that died the next day what an uplifting story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,born to kill next to a peace sign the duality of man in a city besieged with homeless in a culture where in general people do not matter if they do not contribute via some form of employment yet we throw tremendous resources towards raccoons and other animals if you abuse your dogs in some states you can go to jail what about abusing humans that happens all the time we make them sleep out in the cold rain snow often with little or no food and water they desperately lack the proper mental health care but also lack access to the prescription drugs needed to be less of a burden on all of us im not judging were all guilty of it just pointing out the duality in our culture humans fascinating animals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,humans build roads and tunnels and such critters die
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good work everyone burgers on me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they should have rescued humans instead
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if only they had lives
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jesus i know
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you euthanize already dead animals like the raccoon in this story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its thinking like this that leads us all to be unhappy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a very selfish way of thinking
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not a waste it was an obstruction in a drain needed to be removed if animal or object the tremendous heart crap is just fluff to make a story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,absofuckinglutely the municipality probably puts down dozens of raccoons every week but theyre willing to spend tens of thousands to try to rescue one doomed trash panda its no wonder such places teeter on the brink of bankruptcy ive rescued raccoons before and love them and other animals but theres no excuse for being such damnable fools about it put on your big girl panties put a bullet in its head to end its suffering fish out the body and move on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lol its not like their gonna doing anything after the fact prevent this from happening again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think its standard procedure to rescue humans stuck in pipes too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gotta make sure those zombie fuckers are dead also
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it died anyways right after being rescued they could have put it down so it wouldnt suffer the extra hours
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just cant understand how anyone could do that to unconditional love and complete trust so glad this had a happy ending
UpliftingNews,not_removed,poor lara glad to see she found some new nice people to be with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rpupliftingnews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why would an abused man want a used handbag dumbass sexist bitch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cullen has to go to colorado to be with his mom who has cancer hope his good karma comes around soon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,glad this meets a stranger on craigslist had a happy ending or at least didnt end horribly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gotta love the aircooled family
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my favorite part about this article is that the writer used the phrase hither and yon like its no big deal hooray local news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just pay to have the car shipped to me and i will paint the car for you yes for free i know im a nice person said nobody on craigslist ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,drove a new beetle till miles or so spedo quit bout half way no heat last twenty years had floor pan done one paint job four engine top end redone one major engine rebuild still no heat last twenty years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when i was a kid growing up in the mid everyone turned them into off road dune buggies of sorts with roll cages and everything no fender wells no doors tail pipes that pointed straight up in the air feet they had skinny narrow tires that went through anything by the late into the early a hiker could damn near find a rusted abandoned hulk of a beatle anywhere deep in the woods they were a car you could buy for a couple hundred bucks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tell that fool i got a gen civic wagon that needs some tlc babe put a word in
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shell pay me with happiness
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i purchased a vw bug in what seemed like cherry condition beautiful paint job new seats great head liner interior roof decent sound system new carpets what more could you ask for sigh what more could you ask for to begin with it had a leak in cabin pillows that allowed carbon monoxide to seep into the cabin the ride home dropped oil the entire way and a combination of the leak and checking out my new ride in a degree summer garage i received a combination of a heat stokepoisoning this lasted about months i could not even get into the car without my brain feeling like it was over heating i did purchase the vw bible booklet but had no desire to work on the car drove it up to the vw shop and the mechanic was literally smiling ear to ear asked for an inspection and received a cvs receipt httpimgurcomgalleryapyakwu later the car still dropped oil like a stuck pig and something blew on the freeway since they were the last to handle the car i asked them to cover some of the costs later they wanted it was up and running some what still dropped oil like stuck pig come to find out they have these cent filters by the rear wheels that stopped the leak also scary as hell when it would leak oil directly onto my tires fuck me put it on ebay with full disclosure that i was not a mechanic here is my receipts take it off my hands higher than i paid still lost only thank god another foolish vw seeker picked it up it fell off the radar till i searched online a few years later to see that it was in a salvage yard missing a front fender and tire never again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a classic vw bug is my absolute dream car thanks to good ol herbie my jealousy is absolutely seething at this article good for them though really
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i live in richmond its nice to see something good come out of this town once in a while
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fucking hell he had to leave to help his mum with her third cancer battle this guy makes spiderman seem bitter
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive had bugs in the now if i were to ever get one i would make it a baja bug

UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i had the money id love to do this putting old cars back together is something i grew up to enjoy doing with my dad every day after school never get many opportunities to do it anymore
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a super beetle yes that is actually a thing my first car was the exact same a super beetle and the previous owner had painted it pretty much this same redfor a second i actually thought it might have been my old bug trippy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,meanwhile also in virginia im trying to sell a subaru on craigslist and all im getting are scamming attempts

UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a feel good story and all but i doubt id give my first born a beetle as their learning car in an age when asshole parents are giving kids they never taught right or wrong to trucks and suvs to be the first cars they crash those things are going to crash into something and i wouldnt want it to be my kid in a beetle ill put it this way when i was in high school there was a kid whose parents gave him a new supra the car was at the time he crashed it so they gave him a new turbo as punishment i guess
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i assume that is his house in the background sure looks lie she could afford to pay someone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and hes immediately put in the friend zone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for some reason he insisted on fixing it blindfolded though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rniceguys

UpliftingNews,not_removed,show me the reverse of this happening and ill be impressed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is the real pimp my ride
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cool though in order to restore it for free he had to be putting his own money in as soon as he started the project anyway just saying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,lynchburg okay
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this should be posted on rtwoxchromosomes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,deleted

UpliftingNews,not_removed,blowjobs are amazing things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i have a friend who met his now wife and mother of kids on craigslist dating ad one of the best couples i know not everyone on the internet is evil
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im guessing this is going to end with her sueing him a bit down the line after all this is america
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like most normal relationships tbh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,misread as virgin woman no restoration necessary
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why did it take two years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,had a totally different meaning when i read it as virgin woman
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i initially thought it said virgin woman and was going to say thats the most effort ive ever seen someone put into trying to get laid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,read virgin womanmeets stranger on craigslist while half paying attention what a welcome relief upon second reading
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i went to high school with cullen hes a pretty dang cool dude weird this is my first time seeing someone i know mentioned on reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,any way we can help this kid out seems like a good guy cmon reddit we can do this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wonder if they need donations for the medical
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plot twist the brake lines are knicked with a file to fail catastrophically a year from now seriously this is a sweet story and im sure that this didnt happen reasonably sure maybe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we all know that he was hoping for a happy ending but did he get it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im assuming the dude got friendzoned hard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks for doing all this work whys the trunk welded shut
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but where does it say he puts his ownoney in it explicitly says he gave her a bank account number and she periodically deposited money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well not yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey im ethan bradberry
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,just wait its not over yet
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i didnt notice this is rupliftingnews and i was prepared mentally that there will be something about rape after the but in the title
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sure there was a happy ending involved
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes i also think he got laid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,beetles are like the mormons of cars you think you should hate them you want to hate them every fibre of your being says you should hate them but goddamn you just cant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hooray richmond great little city lots of fun
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you mean you dont
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does a vw not use coolant lines to heat the cabin bc no heat is usually a very bad sign with regulating temperature of the engine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,now youre lucky to find a pre thats running for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,happy ending
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you didnt follow jey lenos advice then i assume never buy a old restored car from someone with a tiled garage they are just inn it for the money make it look good and sell it to a chump the people you want to buy old restored cars from is the guy who only get to work on it after he put his kids to bed at night who has a garage that is falling apart the guy who works on it with love
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like a typical vw and i mean that with love i own a
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unfortunately this is the kind of thing you can expect when dealing with older cars especially ones that can be considered special interest like a bug ive had a few old cars come and go some im glad to not touch again others i miss every day you either need the money and hopefully a trusted mechanic or the know how to keep them going when buying something restored its best to seek advice from an expert on the car a mechanic or even help online there would no doubt be a large community of vw restorers in your town that are always happy to fill anyone with their god like wisdom my interest is old subarus and the amount of people that give me advice is astounding
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice things happen here sometimes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,deleted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,supers ftw mins currently waiting for me on the other side of the world poor babber
UpliftingNews,not_removed,make sure its clean clean it inside out and out clean the wheels vacuum every nook and cranny clean inside the engine compartment clean the dash use a toothbrush then clean it again make sure its insured so anyone who is interested can testdrive it then follow these steps finally if you do all that and it still doesnt sell your price is too high
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because theyre illiterate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive gotten quotes to repaint my vw microbus properly and they all are minimum add another grand in parts and shell be all restored hopefully some day ill be able to afford to do it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,valid point i guess i could have explained it more clearly than the title suggests though i was limited in space
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that place is a shithole this is a much better place for it its happy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nothing wrong with that key word being guaranteed
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh man thats just horrible and as im typing this i see below we have but one rule dont be a dick
UpliftingNews,not_removed,westfield reppin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,please tell cullen hes so freaking handsome and that the man bun totally works for him
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice you start and well follow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wildcard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cut the brake lines dennis yeehaw
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a vw beetle theyll fail catastrophically in a month anyway as soon as the drums wear down my first car was a beetle man i loved that little death trap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,remind me year inform police of ubercorsairs uncanny foresight
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey contact the website the article is on they probably have an email they would have contact details
UpliftingNews,not_removed,most of the time people talking about sending skin in the mail end up involved in stories with terrible endings
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it says in the third paragraph that it was done though cullen and his friends including his girlfriend chipped in moving the car hither and yon as it got cut welded ground filled sanded prepped primped carpeted reupholstered chromed and rebuilt sanding priming sanding priming cullen recalled nevermind i see at the end it says the front seats still need to be done
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes on facebook if you have an account you can message him there
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish strangers would line up to help me out so much pointless generosity out there i mean its great justi dunno some people really need help im sure the van is pretty though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,came here to say this if he didnt get a blowy out of this i swear ill drive there right now and suck his dick myself
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was uncomfortable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plot twist he doesnt even like cars and he is really an entomologist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well one photo does show a sidehug so you might be right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait what
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know the feeling
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre all air cooled arent they
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no it uses air forced through boxes heated by the exhaust and into the cabin no heat probably means it was missing short plastic tubes that connect the heater boxes to the cabin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aircooled engine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,vws are air cooled theres a joke beetle drivers all carry big fire extinguisers not for safety but so they dont have to stop every fifty miles to cool down
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is funny now they were junked regularly and then gutted for offroad it had to have been or down by old man johnson farm which backed up to woodlands and marsh was turned into sorta an off road track which led even deeper into the woods theyd go anywhere and parts were cheap if they didnt go somewhere a chainsaw made quick work of getting them someplace new it used to be as if private property ownership of woodlands didnt even exist when the damn things broke down in boonies theyd end up abandoned and soon filled with bullet holes ten twenty year later they be nearly reclaimed by nature bushes would grow up out of them thered be gopher holes in the center no big deal nowadays its probably an environmental crime trespassing i was really lucking growing up then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its actually really easy to find a pre for below
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sure he said shell pay me with her penis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive never heard that but damn need to remember the tiled garage i have a year old tig welder year old milling machine and my year old lathe yes i still use them when i need a tool
UpliftingNews,not_removed,never buy a old restored car from someone with a tiled garage that being said man do i love taking advantage of the lift at my maker spake with its clean and painted concrete floor
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ohhhhh you own one of those loud muthafuckers i love those
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is true but the bugs are so simple and easy to work on now the prices are through the roof for parts but being able to take an engine completely out of the car install another engine and have the car running in like three hours still blows my mind especially with just two guys and a floor jack no special tools required
UpliftingNews,not_removed,datsuns are tanks guy i had a that would drive with two dead cylinders even hit with one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i actually found the woman on facebook by typing in her name we exchanged pleasantries nice woman apparently the kids mom has cancer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,repaint minimum bloody hell can anyone confirm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that sounds like a wedding rate tell somebody youre buying something for a party its this price tell them its a wedding the price doubles your old classic bus is getting the wedding rate you can get a pretty good paint job for if theyre doing bodywork too the cost can skyrocket though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im looking to restore a landcruiser grand at least
UpliftingNews,not_removed,damn he rebuild from raw rare earth elements
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ualtereagle make it possible bro
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i actually know him as well if you want to pm me
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also maybe we can help him out with his own bug
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you take it for the team son
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nobody wants a wildcard charlie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bitches
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not sure if this is an insomnia reference or not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,older jeeps are fun little death traps too friend of mine has a postal version crude brakes top heavy no creature comforts to speak of i really really want one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you be careful hell cut yours too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are the other redditors eligible for your offer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope this is one of those threads that the person in the article shows up in the comments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,someone gotta do this as a job
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is this going to be like the safe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while i disagree with their beliefs they are at least nice people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these mormons are they small and dressed in black and have big noses and a tendency to fly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea they probably dry rotted a looonng time ago
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love how so many people leapt at the chance to say the engines air cooled doing nothing at all to answer the actual question about why no hot air was getting to the cabin the one guy did but still reddit isnt a competition to correct people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i put her on the back of my bike and we went riding down by old man johnsons farm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,her penis ಠಠ
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rnocontext
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pics would love to see them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not particularly loud i mean its got stock exhaust and all and its only a liter engine
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ive been getting a lot more interested in them lately mostly for the baja offroad conversions ive looked at a couple one being a fully completed baja buggy that was road legal one of the reason i love the cheap old cars is their simplicity the bloke with the baja had five more beetles and a split screen combi shell on his property safe to say he was pretty keen on them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah i dont believe that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wish there was something we could for him since were local like a gift basket for the road i dont know
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if theyre disassembling the car down to bare metal doing body work and a decent paint job you could easily hit its so easy to underestimate how long it takes to fix even a small section of a car
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you want it done well probably
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea depending on how rusteddented amd dinged the body is sounds about right also finding the correct color can be a pain also i had a honda accord whose body was pretty good and it would have cost me about to have it repainted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not his job tracking down parts learning new skills waiting for her to deposit cash for parts materials etc plenty of reasons projects like this drag on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my free car that youre building unpaid in your spare time is taking way too long restoring a car in years is pretty damn good actually most restos i know of take at least years probably more thorough rebuilds though but years for an amatuer rebuild is very fast any way you look at it all those rebuild in a week reality tv shows arent how shit really works even pro rebuilds take at least months irl
UpliftingNews,not_removed,messaged him on facebook itd be really cool if we could set up some kind of gofundme to help out with his mom im not sure how the details would work out with that as i have no experience with that sort of thing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats what i was thinking i hope theres some way we can help this guy who has been so generous sounds like hes going through a rough time and it might lift his spirits and provide him with a distraction ill check back in with this thread
UpliftingNews,not_removed,go to hell charlie we never liked you anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ya he doesnt even like get us man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jeeps were rated as americas worst car i wish i had one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i had an jeep which was my first love it only tried to kill me a few times
UpliftingNews,not_removed,keep us updated
UpliftingNews,not_removed,woah wait in line like the rest of us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that they are i live in an apartment and they live across the hall from me they have been using the apartment for about a year and a half and every one that has come in has been nice and never once tried to talk to me about mormonism i dont bother to try and learn their names anymore because they cycle in and out so fast but honestly they have been great neighbors
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice people dont try and actively recruit others to their brainwashed cult just saying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mormons not jews
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in some beetles past owners have smashed them in with a hammer because when that heater works it is like a furnace
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but theyre aircooled
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are no coolant lines in an aircooled engine coolant is literally the main and only a purpose in a liquidcooled engine so albeit bluntly i answered the question i replied to
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you caught my embellishment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kph not mph
UpliftingNews,not_removed,mine is runs perfect and can go i have proof
UpliftingNews,not_removed,according to his facebook he moved within the last two weeks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good luck using reddit to help the gofundme i once posted a comment with a gofundme link to help a police dog surgery funds who was shot in the line of duty and then lost for days after the shooting because she was scared one officer died during the exchange of fire the dog lived but was found days later with bullet holes in her long story short my comment was auto filtered by reddit and nobody could see it but me because it had a link to a gofundme in it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would also e down to contribute
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you so much im really glad my comment didnt go unnoticed and its even better than youve actually met him please send me the gofundme link if you arent be able to post it on here as the comment below you suggests he seems like such a good dude and the fact he said he was doing it for the experience speaks volumes about him a person anyways i know his mother was not what this story was about but i felt that it was mentioned way too fast in the video its just one of those text things that came up and i almost missed it would be really awesome if we could help in anyway
UpliftingNews,not_removed,any luck i would like to contribute to try and help this great human
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what do you think is happening right now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ford pinto worst american car in history

UpliftingNews,not_removed,keep us upholstered
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thought the line was for ops mom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,flying jew best super hero
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well it is german
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you responded only enough to tell the guy hes wrong but not enough to actually help him understand thats classic reddit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well done it was a great story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpsyoutubelfkdmwraiy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nope mileage and if you find it hard to believe imagine our surprise took us a weak to figure out the injectors connector in the wiring harness had failed of course the car weighed lbs so

UpliftingNews,not_removed,no fili wasnt fresh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love yelling put it in h whenever i see someone stall or hear them miss a gear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeaaaa thats some bs 😂
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it was it happened in my home state about an hour from me here was my post sadly the story in comments and link to help her was unavailable for people to see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,count me in as well on this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i really wanted a wrangler until i test drove one you know all those air tunnel tests we did yeah so lets build a brick and put wheels on it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in all honesty they do both look quite similar in facial structure kids can be pretty awesome also i could see these two growing up to edit condensed my two comments into one first gold thanks stranger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it just me or do those kids have different haircuts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont mean to kill the vibe but i think this is really just proof that kids dont think things through very well haha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i hope the teacher played along
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i would argue that its learned not taught
UpliftingNews,not_removed,omg that little tie and suspenders adorable
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gus and shawn the early years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boy wants to get the same haircut as his friend dont be a dick sure but come on now why is this news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not proof
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant tell which one is reddy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i want a penguin tie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,facepalm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,deleted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no because it can be learned through observation
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is great but this isnt proof we dont need proof were adults cheers to these two boys just living life they arent a movement they arent champions of diversity or figure heads for change or anything like that they are just two buds source black guy with a white best friend of over years
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its much stronger proof that the kid is an idiot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats cute as fuck
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and santa clause is real
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if this isnt bullshit which it quite clearly is then those children are really far below the intelligence level they should be at by their age even newborn babies can distinguish between dark and light skin and those two would quite obviously be able to as well this story is just a nonsense propaganda piece of course we know racism can be learned and that black and white people can be friends we dont need this sort of idiocy to state that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sorry but idk how this has anything to do with prejudice the kid should have the logic to know that their skin color would give it away to anyone that can see
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wow so uplifting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,all this shows is that kids are fucking stupid we can try to be in a fairy tale and act like the kids not seeing the color of their skin is a good thing but in all honesty the kid has to be really dumb to not realize his skin is different than his friends
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cool story and all but i dont think this proves anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this doesnt prove anything just the fact that the kid is retarded
UpliftingNews,not_removed,holy shit thats beautiful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youve got to be taught to hate and fear youve got to be taught from year to year its got to be drummed in your dear little ear youve got to be carefully taught
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not to be a debbie downer but im not so sure that that means anything actually i would think it means those kids are not very bright sorry all not a racist generally not a pessimist but i am a realist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is one of the first uplifting news titles ive read that doesnt kill my soul a little bit first
UpliftingNews,not_removed,boy parents sure have a hell of a time living through their kids nowadays
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or it demonstrates that critical thinking and understanding other peoples thought processes are faculties that the brain masters later in development in other words kids are dumb it doesnt prove anything the sample size is tiny
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you youre seriously suggesting humans invented a primal emotion and that it isnt natural i mean really
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i kinda think it would be nicer to let them be friends without bringing up all this adult hate and prejudice stuff just let them be kids cute picture they really do look alike
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you want to read a vision of this kind of thinking ingrained in society check out ann leckies superb sf novel ancillary justice leckie tells the story of the radch a people who are so unconcerned with gender that they dont even see it and they use female pronouns for everyone because the radch also deal with other civilizations they are always trying to remember how to tell men from women so they dont screw up when addressing other races
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it actually is i often think kids are so much smarter than adults at times
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or systemic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,touching story but this doesnt prove that hate and prejudice is something taught i think feelings of hate and prejudice are ingrained into all of our psyches whats uplifting is our effort to overcome that part of ourselves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that is by no means proof we are drawing conclusions from a childs lack of wisdom in making decisions nothing more
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it can be taught but just as easily learned people with low socioeconomic status love to create scapegoats most commonly other ethnic groups on top of that humans are tribal in nature and will naturally gravitate toward those who look like themselves this is self evident just by observing the world around us and no amount of liberalism or feel good stories is going to change that i would actually argue that black people due to their generally lower socioeconomic status are more racist against white people than vice versa and i cant really blame them because whites have historically and to some degree contemporarily treated blacks like second class citizens i also cant really blame white people who who may hold racist viewpoints because frankly most black stereotypes are statistically validated the best we can do is live side by side i dont think we will ever truly live as one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its sad that this is even noteworthy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think i disagree prejudice is learned yes but not necessarily taught
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or something shown by the media on a daily basis
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when my dad was a little kid he asked his black friend if he pooped white
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this has been long proven prejudices start being formed after age
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you just know they gun be bros for life
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if this is true who taught the first person hate and prejudice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love should be mandated between all people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if its something taught then how did it start i suspect its just human nature to distrust or hate people who seem different
UpliftingNews,not_removed,chicken and the egg if hate is taught who did humans learn it from
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honestly though they look a lot alike nose chin ears eyes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i mean i get that point of the story and i agree that hate a prejudice is something we teach our kids but damn sons you guys are stupid af realizing that somebody has a different color isnt hateful or racist it is just how it is adding values to those differences is what is racist like he is worse than me because he is black is racists we look different is not racist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres been studies posted stating most young kids prefer their own race
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its rarely something taughtits inundated in our culture that you grow up to become aware of how you handle that is up to you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this doesnt prove anything
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i teach year old kids here in korea i am white first of all despite koreans being overwhelmingly patriotic at times when theyre not complaining about how much they hate korea my kids barely know theyre korean when you show them a picture of the korean flag and ask what it is they say taekwondo cos its on all the uniforms but what i came to say was they dont even really realise im white one day i was marking their work and my arm was beside my my students arm in a tone of total amazement he said teacher why is my arm brown and your arm white then he touched all my freckles it was adorable my husband who is korean came to visit one day they think he is my dad i tried to explain in english and korean but no he is my dad to them the fact that we are different races is not a thing to them at all kids really dont notice these things til they are pointed out to them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes going places
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is it racist now to simply recognize an individuals skin tone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well thats just bloody sweet isnt it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im seeing double here four little kids
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and the left clearly got taught just that but its ok when it is against somebody with a different opinion
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe the kid is just really stupid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,could just be proof that kids a dumbass
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i live in a canadian town with almost no black population i met a black guy from florida and his white wife on a separate occasion and different time i met their little boy about the same age as these two when he was playing and away from his folks i said hey name of child is your dad name of dad you kind of look like him he is as black as his dad he replied everyone says that like he didnt know he was black i thought it was just great that he hasnt experienced racism i hope he never does racism is taught behaviour
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anecdotal evidence hate is something taught
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that really isnt proof one way or the other
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so true racism really is something that is nurtured and learned from a persons environment whether youre white black asian etc sad because there are a lot of great people out there to get to know regardless of what the msm likes to portray there is more good than bad however it is beyond unfortunate that people out there will never want to get to know another individual just because they are different from themselves
UpliftingNews,not_removed,til you all thought hate and prejudice was natural and also when you guys make a big fuss about this it means skin color is still an issue in your country
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while i agree that racism is learned the idea that not being racist means you dont see color is a hindrance for the abolition of racism thinking you have to not notice the physical differences in order to not be racist puts a barrier that cant be surpassed because unless your blind or incredibly naive you cant not notice true racial equality comes when you see the differences and simply dont care
UpliftingNews,not_removed,white kid wants to be black news black kids wants to be white will never make news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,predisposition does not mean expression therefore genetics dont dictate behavior or personality sure they can be a contributing factor but they arent the deciding one if they were personalities and behaviors would not be open to change
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jax reddy gonna be friends for life hope no backwoods asshats mess that up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there is only one human race some humans are just better at sunshine than others
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for posting this story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is so cute but its not hateful or prejudiced to be able to tell people apart by such an obvious visible feature as skin color
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can we be honest here the kid is either joking or hes developmentally disabled you would have to be literally blind to not see a big difference in skin color
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if you want real proof there are schools that reprogram rescued children that were raised in hate culture
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bullshit tribalism is an inborn trait
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminds me of a sexual assault case that happened at my university recently they sent out a mass email describing the assailant in great detail but failed to mention if he was white hispanic asian or black political correctness police are at it again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ha what a couple of idiots
UpliftingNews,not_removed,stupid kid
UpliftingNews,not_removed,taught by the president
UpliftingNews,not_removed,of course its taught or better yet learnt i wasnt born disliking aboriginals but seeing them waste government money school resources and ruining my country town of course i came out slightly racist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so they are not skinheads
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this just shows that kids are dumb
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i agree the fbis data about the overwhelming amount of crime that black people commit compared to their representation in the us population is what taught me to be cautious of them i wasnt born with that instinct but thankfully i was able to learn it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its something taught in that you learn it the hard way
UpliftingNews,not_removed,adoption foster or genetics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i cant help but think of jd and turk
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its in the chin and cheeks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,god i miss psych
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they have identical ears cute little buggers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is exactly what i thought
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they are practically carbon copies of each other if you ignore their skin tone
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i call that face shape kid shape
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i fucking miss this show
UpliftingNews,not_removed,who the fuck are those guys httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvohhgllqskro
UpliftingNews,not_removed,psych
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what show is that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think in the original post the mother attached the photo just to show the two friends together its not a photo of the kid after getting the haircut
UpliftingNews,not_removed,racist
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres also ample evidence kids are sexist and racist from birth edit extra info because nitpicking recent publications show that exposure dominates race and sex preferences from birth to year but they did have preference from ages extra race and sex preferences clearly emerge theory is currently its tied to language acquisition and exposure but they dont know i call both these factors racism and sexism which frankly they are since they absolutely do not see equality and will act accordingly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly my thoughts i mean yea its kinda cute but it really doesnt prove anything except that kids are pretty simple
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that would be so cute
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ethnocentrism is genetic been known for awhile when the chips are down a black man will side with another nonhostile black man over a jew and a jew will side with a nonhostile jew over a north east asian and a north east asian will side with a nonhostile north east asian over a white etc this applies to religions as well ie christians with christians muslims with muslims just see how unevenly distributed the unique populations of the us are instead of being smoothly distributed across the regions we see huge density spikes separated by large gaps filled with population centers dominated by other groups scientists found strong ethnocentric behaviors in borderlinenewborn babies black babies preferred to play with other black babies with black dolls and had lowered fear responses when around black adults as opposed to whites babies white dolls and white adults whom they showed a much more heightened fear reflex tribalism is in the dna and when society goes to shit you can see that any and all ideas about onelove and multiculturalism are thrown out the window now coldblooded hate especially in a decent socioeconomic situation that is certainly a learned behavior
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gosh that show was amazing seasons then just fell and fell hard
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he said he couldnt wait to go to school on monday with his hair like reddys so that his teacher wouldnt be able to tell them apart i think its more this part saying that the kid didnt recognize race to an extreme either way its a puff piece it doesnt need to be hard hitting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also to say they dont look different because of the skin color is retarded and not racist or hate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wanted a flat top haircut when i was but it was because of the dick tracy movie and my parents never told what why i couldnt have it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how cute is fuck exactly
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gotta knock you down to pick you up s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is actually true were born with a lot of terrible inborn instincts and impulses that no longer help us in a modern context we really arent that far removed from the jungle and back in the day as a general rule you really wanted to hang out with things that looked as much like you as possible for a number of reasons that said we are also born with tremendous adaptability and malleability and are therefore able to suppress those natural biases and learn better behaviors that ability of ours is borderline miraculous and it should be celebrated thats the cool thing about this to me its no less touching and this simplistic selfhating narrative seems to be the exact opposite of reality we should celebrate and embrace the progress that this exemplifies not get down on ourselves because some people are mean to some other people when again it wasnt that long ago that we were tearing each others throats out for little reason at all have some perspective people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,children develop egos and personal agendas as they grow older they formulate alliances based on a perception of shared selfinterest and values some actually do the work of leveraging their own abilities towards positive outcomes others just mirror the larger group while identifying and attacking the other if people werent selfish assholes with crappy action plans there would be no hate or prejudice
UpliftingNews,not_removed,go back to rthedonald you god damn nazi we dont want your kind here
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agreed a truly inconvenient truth
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nice to hear you talk of the innocence of children
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sjws care too much everythings race and skin color and gender and etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and some are better at math abstract reasoning and delaying gratification
UpliftingNews,not_removed,guess the president is pretty old then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,huh my story okay it was never easy for me i was born a poor black child i remember the days sittin on the porch with my family singin and dancin down in mississippi
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why does know one think of psych
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i thought of barack and joe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you mean turkandjd and jd right
UpliftingNews,not_removed,brown bear
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eaaaagglllle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was thinking of barney and james
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i feel like their noses are similar as well
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i miss seasons of the west wing or really any aaron sorkin series
UpliftingNews,not_removed,
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvklijaxmxcm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they look like they could be related
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sean and gus from a comedic crime solving show called psych
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if she had showed the aftercut photo we wouldnt be able to tell them apart
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think you missed that one rule at the bottom of the text box
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the only study i found was which suggests that while they will show preference for race as early as three months it is still learned there was another study that suggested nine months and another that had to do with gender preferences but they both pointed out that it isnt from birth do you have a study that did find the behavior would be exhibited from birth seems interesting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,source
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres also ample evidence kids are sexist and racist from birth humans innately react more favorably to other humans that have similar traits to them and their immediate family once they are capable of processing that similarity sexist and racist have negative connotations here that dont apply
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no kids are playing it safe kinda like my month baby gets scared when a stranger picks him up but not when somebody he knows does it imagine then if that stranger also looks like samuel l jackson and my kid has never seen a black person before of course he will be scared he is also scared of people with giant beards
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for the last time jamal i know its you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think it is ethnocentrism so much as it is you are more likely to interact with who you grow up around the studies i could find touching on this ranged from months for learning this behavior key word being learning the abstract from the first study i found says the findings imply that adults perceptions of ethnic differences are learned and derived from differences in exposure to own versus otherrace faces during early development i asked someone else in the thread but ill ask you as well do you have any studies suggesting this behavior is present at birth source edit saw your sources in another the reply the second one suggests it is evolutionary but did we evolve to respond well to those we grow up around or respond to those with the same ethnicity i guess they could both be true depending on how you define ethnicity it also seems they are tweaking variables throughout which would tell me the environment does play some role i wish i had time to sit down and read the whole thing because it seems really interesting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you just call religion a product of genetics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tribalism is in the dna and when society goes to shit you can see that any and all ideas about onelove and multiculturalism are thrown out the window the spike in leftright tribalism weve seen growing in america these last few months being a perfect example of this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not true ethnocentrism is about culture not race genes dont play any role in your worldview thats absurd genes contribute to your physical and biological traits this is nurture its a learned bias your psychological state is shaped by your environment what youre taught monkey see etc the reason why tribalism is prevalent is because its evolved from our huntergatherer ancestors over thousands of years its learned early and hard for survival but its a fallacy that weve just yet to evolve out of race and culture are two uniquely different concepts this poster is muddling and mixing these into a hodgepodge to support a perceived bias theres no evidence to back these claims
UpliftingNews,not_removed,gonna need sources to back up those mighty claims
UpliftingNews,not_removed,out of curiosity could you direct me to these studies i know we have a strong tendency to have ingroups and outgroups and side with those we identify with i could see babies associating stronger positive feelings with the racelanguage of their families and thus with prefer those who are like they view most similar to their care givers also do you know if theres research on how this affects those children of mixed race like if theyd be more likely to mingle with other race children or only those of their mixed family or if theyd be more likely to do so with the side theyre more influenced by
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i love this you spent some time on it too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,preference toward members of ones own community could easily be more due to environment than genetics though we naturally trust people who look like those with whom we feel the most comfortable this obsession with dna makes you come across as somewhat deranged
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plot twist the teacher is blackwhite colorblind
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats fine but what does looking different mean for those boys
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he already told you fuck is as cute as cute is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,about kilocutes kc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im triggered over the naivety of so many on this site the fact people blindly believe this shit to be true is incredibly infuriating
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyd know they have different color skin from what im seeing thats not the point
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thank you for your input however your comment doesnt logically follow any rational path so i must ignore it good day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,add civilization to the list those mud huts are starting to look nice though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,at least you learned the difference between shit and shinola
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ugh you jerk how dare you p
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there it isdidnt take long
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hmm i dont no
UpliftingNews,not_removed,in between these lines theres a lot of obscurity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and ears
UpliftingNews,not_removed,obviously
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just did some quick searching and found the same article you did and a couple others and it seems that it is learned i cant find anything to suggest its somehow innate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah the whole race preference thing largely comes from children being exposed to people primarily from their own race at least up until school age i havent read any studies that show race preference from birth only preferences for human faces in general
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i found this excerpt whats more decades of research suggests that even if parents are not talking about race children are noticing it so avoidance will not make it go away by or years of age white children in the us canada australia and europe show preferences for other white children for example while parents of children in the storybook study above predicted that their children would show no race bias the children did on average tend to favorite whites to blacks results like these demonstrate that those very same white children whose parents insist their children do not see race walk into research labs across the world and when presented with a lineup of possible friends are quick to select the white ones rather than the black asian hispanic or indigenous ones note im sure theres more info about the actual research but there does seem to be some validity to it i didnt think it was even remotely true myself edit upon further reading it does seem to be learned
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theres some study showing newborns look at their own race much longer than other races im too lazy to google it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tribalism is genetic and tribalism is somewhat though no completely flexible in this case the human mind seems to very good at integrating religious ideology into its selfidentity allowing it to more easily identify with sympathize help trust and depend on members of the same faith while being subconsciously and notso subconsciously hostile to members of opposing faiths though there is still a very strong preference for members of that religion to also be members of the same race or ethnicity and generally youll find that in any given region religion is often divided very closely on racial and ethnic lines i understand that i worded it incorrectly in my op however but what i mean is what i have said above
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that post was just a long winded way of saying i want to justify my fear of others
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it also highlights ethnocentrism as well republican and democrat bases are strongly divded on racial lines with the majority of whites going to republicans and the overwhelming majority of nonwhites going to democrats people vote in blocks because they are inherently selfish and whats good for their group will probably be good for themselves and how does one determine whats good for the group well just see how the group is voting and do the same if people didnt think in groups we would expect to see far more evenly distributed voting blocs instead they are highly concentrated on race ethnicity gender and religion indicating what is already blatantly obvious people are tribal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is not true ethnocentrism is about culture not race genes dont play any role in your worldview a person with downsyndrome has a very different world view than someone with autism to use an extreme example this is nurture its a learned bias your psychological state is shaped by your environment what youre taught monkey see etc then why do twins have different personalities when being raised in the same environment the reason why tribalism is prevalent is because its evolved from our huntergatherer ancestors over thousands of years so genetic
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we naturally trust people who look like those with whom we feel the most comfortable this obsession with dna makes you come across as somewhat deranged how do you not see the contradiction here where do you think our looks come from what makes a black woman look different than an asian one its not the dirt its genetics and if we are genetically programmed to seek out those who look like us and looks are determined by genetics and people of our ethnicity are more likely to share the same phenotypical traits then how exactly is this not indicative of ethnocentrism being a genetic predisposition
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ethnocentrism is a nearly universal syndrome of attitudes and behaviors typically including ingroup favoritism and no it isnt the racist point of view it does however explain why racism and hate for other groups outside of a humans ingroup are so readily found in human beings its not racist it just tells us where racism comes from
UpliftingNews,not_removed,humans are inherantly tribalistic and nothing will ever change that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ok fine reality is racist but there is a way out two in fact one involves the end of a gun and the other is to scream and cover your ears until everything bad goes away i think youve practiced enough its good to be a wellrounded person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fake news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,nothing probably
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im going to stay this color
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did nazi that pun coming
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you mean joe and barry er yeah it really is one of the better shows on television now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dont think that implies racism to any degree whatsoever i agree that this article seems a little farfetched with what theyre inferring from a simple request but its an even bigger stretch imo to say that a or year old holds malice towards other races instinctively
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tribalism is evolutionary not genetic genes have nothing to do with it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you sound confident ill take it all as fact thanks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,tribalism is genetic and tribalism is somewhat tribalism is also an improper noun keep those capitals under control
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your post is just a way of saying i want reality to be a certain way and ill dismiss any and all evidence that indicates that its different
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that post was just a long winded way of saying i want to justify my fear of others i believe you mean correct and completely based in science unless youd like to prove me wrong which you cant because this stuff is really well understood by now and we can see its effects in almost every aspect of society both in the present as well as in the past we see it in how societies are divided up how population groups congregate and selfsegregate why wars are fought who genocides are most often targeted at etc look at the dissolution of yugoslavia serb vs croats christians vs muslims look at the dissolution of the soviet union russians vs ukrainians vs polish vs germans look at the splitting of the christian church catholics vs protestants look at the violence in africa of the violence in africa can be traced back to its extreme diversity and how groups react to differing groups look at the history of genocides most are committed on racialethnic grounds the rest are committed on religious grounds and only a few are truly unrelated to either look at the middle east shiites vs sunnis look at the indiapakistan split hindus vs muslims look at the israelipalestinearab conflict jews vs arabs and palestinians judiasm vs islam look at the history of slavery white on black arab on white look at the history of the uk english vs literally everyone else look at the sectarian violence in ireland once again catholic vs protestant etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep just like saying that war exists is inherently justifying every war ever nazis dont exist only hitler would ever say otherwise
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a person with downsyndrome has a very different world view than someone with autism to use an extreme example because those are biological differences then why do twins have different personalities when being raised in the same environment because although twins they dont share the same experiences they live completely separate lives so genetic evolution ≠ genetics
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why do you think a sense of belonging to a community is based solely on physiological resemblance you think a poor uneducated white person raised in an ethnically mixed community is going to feel like they have more in common with a upper class white person than than they do with the people they grew up with just because they have the same skin colour
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are very cryptic edit and by that i mean i cant very well parse out the meaning in your comments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or the kid on the left is an albino negro and the kid on the right is a melanistic caucasian
UpliftingNews,not_removed,or the white kid is a sarcastic fkr
UpliftingNews,not_removed,very fake news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,each to their own i think its cool you have two kids that point out that the only real difference between us are our complexions to me it shows that being white or black is learned and has far more layers to it than just skin color how as people a lot of us conform to the roles and stereotypes by following the norm this photo destroys that notion by showing that race and culture is something we learn and are not born with
UpliftingNews,not_removed,finally an obscure reference i get
UpliftingNews,not_removed,honestly how could jew
UpliftingNews,not_removed,totally agree not sure if you saw my edit but upon further reading it seems to only be a learned behavior
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not malice its just biology similar people similar goals better chance of survival many many species behave this way just because we became civilized doesnt mean our brains abandoned all those evolved behaviors programmed into us to aid in our survival in the wild
UpliftingNews,not_removed,attractive ok so im assuming the bbw midget fetish develops later in life since we have such a precise and objective definition of attractive before us
UpliftingNews,not_removed,what is your understanding of evolution and by what mechanism does evolution operate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sorry what no seriously what did you actually think before you post human beings are not genetically predisposed to tribal behavior are you high how in the world do you think societies are formed what do you think societies even are how do you think societies are differentiated by each other why in the world do you think human beings paint colors on banners and pieces of cloth and then kill people that are flying different pieces of cloth with different colors on them and why do you think weve been doing it for thousands of years and before we did that we were killing groups of people that werent us that lived down the river up the stream over the hills etc where do you think modern day countries evolved from what in the world are you even talking about we are social animals that naturally congregate into large groups composed of genetically similar individuals striving for a similar goal by that very definition we are tribal
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey i can accuse people of not understanding a subject without demonstrating it in any way too even more bullshit dont talk about talking about genetics when you seem to have no clue about the metasubject
UpliftingNews,not_removed,confident yes true not even close
UpliftingNews,not_removed,language also plays an interesting role in this ingroup outgroup dance linguists believe that the need for language arose in order to discern who was part of our group and who wasnt basically if youre in the safety of your cave and you hear something approaching and you dont feel like leaving to find out who it is you just scream out blub if they respond with blub in accordance with prior agreements then its nothing to fear because theyre surely part of your group if they do not respond or respond with something all together foreign then ready yourself for defenseagain still from the security of your cave hell even stereotypes played an important role in chances of survival and were based in at least some form of truth if not hard truth also people keep saying that this behavior is taught to or learned by children as if adult humans are at fault for imparting such biases onto infants and children and its not their fault for growing up with said biases last i checked the survival rate of a child without adult supervision is about so what the fuck do they know whats good for them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,burden of proof lies on the one making the outrageous claims my dude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a person with downsyndrome has a very different world view than someone with autism to use an extreme example because those are biological differences genetics shapes the biology of offspring does it not because although twins they dont share the same experiences they live completely separate lives i think you are the first person i have ever met who has said that personality is percent nurture homosexuality is considered by some to be genetic is this not going to be an example of worldview being shaped by genetics so genetic evolution ≠ genetics wait so what is it that makes us similar to our ancestors is it not genetics i cannot fathom how you arent extrapolating that where our behavior is similar to that of our ancestors it is similar because of genetics i mean it isnt a to genetics causes personalities to be this way there is obviously nurture involved but you vastly underestimate the role of genetics if you do not believe that it plays a huge role in how humans treat each other anxiety and other mental disorders are biological anomalies that are written into some peoples genetic code this plays a huge role in building someones worldview
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a white person in an ethnically mixed community is still much more likely to associate himherself with white peers so yes actually they will they might feel more comfortable around nonwhites but in the end the circles they most often run in will be majority white and when heshe does hang out with people from other groups heshe will feel like the odd man out because there is that impenetrable racial divide one cant get beyond in the same way many blacks feel like the odd man out in whitemajority communities want to know what states in the us are the most racist the ones with the greatest amount of racial diversity the south that is diversity actually makes people more tribal not less as homogeneity increases racism decreases because there is less of a reason to be racist this is why scandinavia looks like a nonracism paradise because theyre white and many of them have never interacted with black people more than a few times in their lives to most of them racism seemed like a ridiculous concept but as racial divides increase we have seen growing tensions in these countries in this case between scandinavian whites and north africans
UpliftingNews,not_removed,agree was just talking about the original idea that was presented ie racist and sexist bit of an oversimplificationexaggeration
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while evolution in itself is hereditary tribalism is a socially evolved phenomenon what you were implying is that culture and race are synonymous they are obviously not but more to the point tribalism is a social construct for survival
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hey im high as fuck and i agree with you ask him if hes biased not if hes high jeez
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes your argument is much more convincing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not an argument
UpliftingNews,not_removed,these arent outrageous claims they are quite literally selfevident every single part of of almost every single society reflects what i have said the entire history of mankind vindicates exactly what i am relaying to you now to deny this is to stick ones head in the sand i might as well be saying the sky is blue
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry theyre right about this one it sucks agreed but babies are experimentally shown to prefer their own race remember we evolved in relative isolation and never interacted with other groups on the regular until very recently
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i dare you to type babies prefer own race into google the claims are outrageous to you because you know nothing about the subject
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpsghrnlmnihgovprimerbasicsgene are not what people think they are genetics shapes the biology of offspring does it not partly yes this has no bearing on outlook though your initial example of down syndrome vs autism doesnt really have any context here i think you are the first person i have ever met who has said that personality is percent nurture homosexuality is considered by some to be genetic is this not going to be an example of worldview being shaped by genetics i did not say personality is nurture its whats called a complex trait there are multiple factors that contribute but its not the basis this means its extremely malleable and in no way predisposed wait so what is it that makes us similar to our ancestors is it not genetics i cannot fathom how you arent extrapolating how our behavior is similar to that of our ancestors because of genetics i mean it isnt a to genetics causes personalities to be this way there is obviously nurture involved but if you vastly underestimate the role of genetics if you do not believe that it plays a huge role in how humans treat each other anxiety and other mental disorders are genetic often times this plays a huge role in building someones worldview again youre completely misunderstanding what genes are physiologically were similar to our ancestors but thats where the similarities end the genetic difference between you and i is less than we are the same genetically and yet people with exactly the same genes will be different because genes express themselves differently void of sociological and environmental differences youre making an assumption for which the evidence is to the contrary sure genes play a role but they arent selfidentity just quickly genetics dont dictate your behavior or how we treat each other thank god which reminds me religion plays a big big role in shaping psyche and thats not genetic anxiety and stuff can have genetic factors but its mostly learned as evidenced by its drastic increase today environmental sociological familial survival are all factors but more importantly these things cannot be genetic otherwise we wouldnt have the ability to change but back to the original point ethnocentrism is not genetic thats ridiculous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,but more to the point tribalism is a social construct for survival society is a reflection of our biological inclinations which is why you can find so many similar structures divisions hierarchies solutions stories ideals and problems in almost every single society from almost every single time period without fail chimpanzee troops are also a society but that does not mean that chimps form troops because society tells them to they form societies because their biology tells them to and how their societies are structured and how they operate are also largely biological it isnt a coincidence that the vast majority are male dominated societies ruled over by one or two competing alpha males many female wives many children and two or three beta lieutenants something in their body tells them that is the way their troops need to operate something is a social construct when it occurs very rarely andor in isolation when a behaviorpattern is established across almost every single group of human beings the only conclusion one can come to is that something in our dna is compelling us to behave in such a manner considering the formation of tribes based on ethnic and religious grounds is almost universal we can conclude with an extremely high degree of certainty that tribalism is in fact a genetic hallmark of humanity in the same way breathing or eating is for instance religion is also a social phenomena but we can also clearly see that human beings are hardwired to establish religions which is why no matter where you go or what time period you are in if you find a large group of humans you will find religion for one reason or another this behavior became beneficial and thus became innate to the human psyche what form a religion takes is the social construct part jesus muhammed etc because we can see those stories are not universal but religion itself is not
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im literally not saying youre wrong im just saying you need to back up the shit youre saying w facts statistics and studies were not listening to philosophers anymore were listening to scientists and scientists work in raw data give me the facts and ill believe what youre saying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,every single part of of almost every single society reflects what i have said the entire history of mankind vindicates exactly what i am relaying to you now to deny this is to stick ones head in the sand you seem to be overlooking the fact that youre using adultmade constructs to define a characteristic of the entire species if youve ever observed a child in need removed from anyone they know they dont necessarily gravitate towards someone who looks like them theyll gravitate towards someone who looks willing and able to help themmany adults do this too because this has been so easily and frequently observed your premise falls flat the moment you extract an individual from any sort of cultural or societal expectation now if you wanted to make a case for adults understanding risk of the unknown better than kids you might have a point but that isnt necessarily tied to observable physical appearances either on its own however youre point doesnt account for tribalism being learned as opposed to genetics or being taught
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think the point he is making isnt so much the outrageous part but more the claim part you are making a positive claim so the burden of proof is on you if you had said something along the lines of this article does not supply sufficient evidence to support the claim that prejudice is a learned trait then you wouldnt have been making a positive claim you claimed that it was genetic though so you did make a positive claim regardless im not trying to say you are wrong by any means i just wanted to ask if you do have any sources that you can cite for the your claim and i thought this would be a good way to lead into it since we are talking about the burden of proof and all anyway do you have any im genuinely curious as my own experience leads me to believe there may be some truth to what youre saying
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dont say sorry stop apologizing for pointing out facts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,httpsghrnlmnihgovprimerbasicsgene are not what people think they are i dont get why you linked this i understand the basics of what a gene is this might just be normal redditor vs redditor boxing in that occurs and we may just be talking past each other but let me humor myself and continue partly yes this has no bearing on outlook though your initial example of down syndrome vs autism doesnt really have any context here how does this have no bearing on outlook i did not say personality is nurture its whats called a complex trait there are multiple factors that contribute but its not the basis this means its extremely malleable and in no way predisposed what is its in this case are you saying that an individuals genes are not the basis of personality i would argue that this holds the predispositions and whether or not they become actualities depends on environmentchance again youre completely misunderstanding what genes are physiologically were similar to our ancestors but thats where the similarities end the genetic difference between you and i is less than we are the same genetically and yet people with exactly the same genes will be different because genes express themselves differently void of sociological and environmental differences dude human beings are the same genetically as chimpsyour doesnt convince me of anything youre making an assumption for which the evidence is to the contrary sure genes play a role but they arent selfidentity just quickly genetics dont dictate your behavior or how we treat each other thank god which reminds me religion plays a big big role in shaping psyche and thats not genetic anxiety and stuff can have genetic factors but its mostly learned as evidenced by its drastic increase today environmental sociological familial survival are all factors but more importantly these things cannot be genetic otherwise we wouldnt have the ability to change when it has been shown that some people may be predisposed to being homosexual religious or have a foot fetish it leads me to conclude that personality is the actuality built upon the potentialities of a persons genetic code but back to the original point ethnocentrism is not genetic thats ridiculous the idea that a black person feels more comfortable around another black person is not ridiculous what you are calling ridiculous is the idea that this behavior may be rooted in human biology i do not think that is ridiculous if babies prefer faces of their own race there is some biological basis for this there has to be otherwise it wouldnt happen if there is a biological basis for it it may also be the case that there may be a genetic predisposition to it also you said genes play no role in your world view and i disagree with that obviously for one part your genes determine how you look and therefore how you are treated but this is of course learned but i am pretty damn sure that your genes play a role in whether you are generally an optimist or pessimist for instance will to work potentially being genetically determined is going to go pretty damn far in shaping someones worldview i may just be misunderstanding you because i dont think it is outrageous to assume that worldview is affected by your unique genetic makeup and that racism is to a certain extent outcrop of certain human biological tendencies that may have roots in your unique genetic makeup
UpliftingNews,not_removed,correlation does not imply causation this is a logical fallacy made time and again because its very intuitive for the mind social constructs are not rare or isolated by any measure they are wholly ubiquitous we live and die by them race class gender language marriage religion etc are all social constructions most were attempts by early humans to solve complex problems some are antiquated because the problems have long been solved however since many are subconsciously ingrained from an early age they are difficult to break away from in such a relatively short timespan that something in our biology that drives us is not genetics but rather the need for survival the fact that there are universal correlations is due to the fact that we are after all one species
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sarcasm isnt always apparent on the internet you should edit in the s
UpliftingNews,not_removed,behavior that is ubiquitious is genetic it is the only way to explain ubiquitous behavior in the first place lions roar why do lions roar because thats what they do lions to the north lions to the south lions to the east or lions to the west its what they do behavior which varies from group to group are social constructs things we can find in every single society have in essence nothing to do with society at all smiling is genetic as is laughter how do we know because even though they are exclusively tools for social interaction they are absolutely universal that they would exist no matter what society you built that they would exist even if there was no society at all in the same respect tribalism and the formation of tribes is genetic it is an imprinted behavior something humans do and will always do unless an outside force comes in and prevents us from doing so the differences between tribes are social constructs because they are by definition creations of the society they arose in humans are designed at the genetic level to form tribes with genetically and ideologically similar individuals so as to isolate themselves away from others who are not like them that much is painfully obvious by simply looking at the history of human societies stretching all the way back even into prehistory
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is a very narrow viewpoint and not one social scientists subscribe to today physical characteristics and traits can easily be evidenced by genetics the same does not hold true for social ones again its a logical fallacy tribalism became prevalent because it became beneficial for us to do so at one point however one cannot unanimously say that it is something we have always done because we have evidence to the contrary the reason why it may seem genetic is because in past societies you were much more likely to be born live then die around people with identical genetics makeups this does not make tribalism a genetic phenomenon its happenstance due to chance correlation does not imply causation lastly humans were not designed and they were definitely not designed genetically to form tribes humans have evolved and genes are just one factor in evolution others being nurture environment chance etc
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my brother was just there on his honeymoon
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how is it even possible that he finds an average of animals a day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if im not back in five minutesjust wait longer

UpliftingNews,not_removed,its an organization its not hard to believe that they find a year when they have a hour hotline and multiple people working at anytime but regardless he and his staff are doing a good thing for those people
UpliftingNews,not_removed,animals a day seems legit this is a telegraph article a news outlet that is not considered serious journalism in the uk

UpliftingNews,not_removed,yup posted on april
UpliftingNews,not_removed,guys this was published on the of april
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes probably like christopher walken in psychopaths just stealing dogs and waiting for the lost dog flyers to go up then bringing em back for credit on his part or reward money
UpliftingNews,not_removed,watkins himself is years old bald well over and broad with it get it guy hes broad with it also of course this single person doesnt find all the animals hes got a team a squad an theyre broad with that shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,while ive not read the article yet why is this guy losing animals a year in the first place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can we just stop and imagine how the fuck this gets to the frontpage when it is clearly bullshit i know reddit is just as dumb as joe average but this is too much mods admins how good is your botdetection setup how many users almost never comment yet seem to vote like their life depended on it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if he doesnt go by ace he is just wasting everyones time

UpliftingNews,not_removed,i am heinz skitz velvet trainer of dolphins if you want to speak to the dolphin you speak to me why do you want to speak to the dolphin do you know him do you call him at home
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think is an exaggeration he clearly doesnt return a lost animal every minutes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which means he finds a pet about once every minutes
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ace ventura
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe he has one dog and short term memory loss
UpliftingNews,not_removed,allllllllllllllllrighty thennn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this guy is finding pets per day nearly pets per hour or pet every minutes thats without sleeping or eating or taking breaks with hours for sleepfoodbreaks its pets per hour or one lost pet found every minutes i call bullshit and you idiots upvoting this are just well idiots stop up voting click bait

UpliftingNews,not_removed,all righty then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,people call in and pay they later call in to cancel since the dog returned home they claim they foumd the dog because results
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the grim reaper for abused runaways trying to escape torment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,great story
UpliftingNews,not_removed,deuce ventura pet detective
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i know of a gentleman who supported his drug habit by kidnapping dogs and then waiting for a reward to be offered before finding and returning them not exactly a victimless crime but everyone ended up happy id have to give an a for ingenuity
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats just steve carrel in a bald cap
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ace venturaaaaa
UpliftingNews,not_removed,itt ace ventura references
UpliftingNews,not_removed,alrighty then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ironic i am watching ace ventura pet detective at this very moment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,pussyfoot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bit sad he doesnt wear hawaiian shirts and crazy haircuts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,came here looking for an assortment of ace ventura quotes definitely wasnt disappointed edit a word
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a pretty cool thing for him to do
UpliftingNews,not_removed,calling fucking bullshit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,alllll righty then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,shikaka
UpliftingNews,not_removed,allllrighty then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this man is my hero
UpliftingNews,not_removed,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllrighty then
UpliftingNews,not_removed,anyone else real upset he didnt find maow maow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this article is so british made even more british by the uplifting title and lowkey disappointing end they never did find maow maow
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i like that people are focusing on the numbers but i just want to know why george c scott is finding animals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was hoping his name was ethan so i could quip allllllllright ethan but its tom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kooky
UpliftingNews,not_removed,runner up from goodest boy in history
UpliftingNews,not_removed,itt so many people that did not read the article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when he finds a lost ant farm it pushes the average up
UpliftingNews,not_removed,asked myself the same question heres an article summary to save everyone a click team of has a hotline so the public point them in the right direction average of pets recovered per month by his organization
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the worst part is that he was probably trying to raise awareness for volunteer funding without misleading anyone and ended up with a clickbait title written without any say from his organization
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its not him its his agency they find about per month but a lot of them are from people calling them in not as much legwork as the title insinuates
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he found dog with fleas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dog guy heres your dog lady hed been kidnapped by a shadowy crime syndicate posing as another family owner thats not my dog dog guy already walking out the door putting on sunglasses
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes the head of a petfinding company that finds animals a day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,article and headline are misleading he founded an organization and presumably includes some kind of online database that numbers reunited pets with owners almost all of those are returned or found independently still what he does do and has built is impressive
UpliftingNews,not_removed,an hour lool if ppl gonna lie in their posts may as well at least attempt to make the math reasonable some idiot says i found my neighbours lost dogs at the park in less than an hour one day so its legit d
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its an organization not one guy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he probably found one missing ant farm in june
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for the last time tom youre our neighbor and ginger isnt lost shes an outdoor cat and comes home for meals stop bringing her to the door in a net and asking for a reward
UpliftingNews,not_removed,when my sister was in high school she had some friends that would steal peoples dogs while they were at work theyd take them home and feed them and stuff and wait for reward posters to go up then return them for the reward
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe of the animals are sent to their owners next block still raises the average
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats one every minutes roughly but the article says he is leader of animal search uk who unite pets with their owners per month so his trick is hes not doing it he has a ton of people doing it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe people or groups that steal pets keep them in a pound or some other place if he or his team could bust them there they could potentially rescue hundreds at a time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,bad writing lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everything is possible on april
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its in metric
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that number comes from the fact that this pet detective established an organization with other members and they collectively find pets a month
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dogs are pack animals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ace ventura could
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not him his organization that title is total clickbait
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe he steals them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its easy to find the animal when you kidnapped the animal in the first place taps head intelligently
UpliftingNews,not_removed,somebody had a worm farm stolen and he digs them up everyday everywhere and takes them home its beautiful
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yea first thing i did was went to the calculator i call bull shit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he practices catch and release and catch and release
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i was thinking the same maybe there are more cat women than we think
UpliftingNews,not_removed,and to take it even further thats per hour with no time to sleep this redefines the mvp
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also they have a success rate of so that means over animals are lost every day in britain and his team is involved if hes going to bloat the numbers at least make the proportion fathomable there is no way animals are even added to this website every day good catch
UpliftingNews,not_removed,because its lies he didnt even find the cat they were looking for in the article the high number of found animals is owed to a team of employees lost and found posters and an online database where people can post lost and found animals for free it boosts his numbers but id guess the lost and found section of craigslist has as many finds without even trying not that i wouldnt gladly pay real money for somebody to locate one of my lost pets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he doesnt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you know ze dolphin does he call you at ome
UpliftingNews,not_removed,came for ace ventura quotes and was not disappointed im looking for ray finkle and a clean pair of shorts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,like a glove
UpliftingNews,not_removed,kinda hot in this rhino
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does he talk out of his butt please tell me he talks out of his butt best gag ever
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ant farms snakes with its victim still inside pregnant dogscatsany other animal birds with hundreds of small insects inside of them ofc food etc it all adds together
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes founder of animal search uk the countrys largest and arguably only missing pet organisation which every month reunites more than wayward animals with their owners many of those reunions are the product of paidfor searches which can cost up to £ – a service for which watkins and his team boast a find rate of almost per cent – but plenty of others are found through the organisations poster campaigns anonymous hotline and free online database
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he is also the best pet thief
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i just downloaded and played ace ventura and to my son old he thought they were great and was laughing his ass off i was wondering what kinda drugs i was on in the to think jim carrey was funny lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,challenge accepted
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i see nothing wrong with these numbers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does nobody read the articles anymore hes founder of animal search uk the countrys largest and arguably only missing pet organisation which every month reunites more than wayward animals with their owners
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im sure this includes the huge and free database he has and people finding pets without the owners direct involvement of those that do the paying service they find four out of five of their pets
UpliftingNews,not_removed,did you read the article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe he finds a bunch hanging out at a time
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ill pay you half a million to make this movie happen
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not sure if youve seen it or not but in city slickers a movie from the mid thats sort of a joke in the film i cant find a clip of it online but they main character played by billy crystal asks his brother played by jon lovitz about work and he says for a while i was an animal detective once by accident i found this dog and the owner gave me so i made a business out of it i find lost dogs and call the owners people pay a big ransom billy crystal character ransom ransom my god lovitz ransom is a bad choice of words i mean thats the word they used in court but im still fighting it crystal good for you with a look of bewilderment
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cant we have nice things
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this was the plot of an entire episode of el tigre
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats a book by george v higgins called coogans trade written in higgins writes some of the best american crime novels ever except for the part about the best pet detective
UpliftingNews,not_removed,ace ventura did this
UpliftingNews,not_removed,einhorn is finkle
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre a weird guy ace
UpliftingNews,not_removed,everyone else is being ridiculous and saying hes finding a pet every minutes youre here with the facts
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they hold the animals until the owners apologize to them and also charge a large fee
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this made me so mad at the end of the article i was just like fucking lie to me at least just tell me maow maows ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,if i had a bengal no way in hell i would let it outside
UpliftingNews,not_removed,excuse me your balls are showing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh my god did anybody actually read the damn article
UpliftingNews,not_removed,marketing for a feebased petfinder website in america that sort of service is free
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats not ironic its just a coincidence ask bender
UpliftingNews,not_removed,legolas takes down elephant with guys but that still only counts as one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,finds them not returns them he probably counts road kill too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,as he came into the window was a sound of a crescendo he came into her apartment he left the bloodstains on the carpet she was sitting at the table he could see she was unable so she ran into the bedroom she was struck down it was her doom
UpliftingNews,not_removed,comment of the freaking year
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fuck i just lost mine better call now
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he actually just found an old alien ant farm cd and counted it like it was a real ant farm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the team of is only for paid searches or may also include those responsible for maintaining the website it appears that the vast majority of the average of pets recovered per month is the result of the wider network of over volunteers and may even include pets that are reported missing on the website but later marked found after being recovered by traditional means such as by the owner or the pet returning on its own
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this is still very hard for me to believe
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no actually hes trying to promote his book which conveniently was just released
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh so you actually read the article too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fleas who where reported missing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,dog with fleas
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that exactly what happened they belonged to a mexican guy just across the border and they made a tunnel across to the states to start a new life they were an alien ant farm
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats disgusting breaking into peoples houses to steal a dog for reward money also seems like a huge risk were they found out did you report them to the police
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sounds like the plot of seven psychopaths
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i read that as he fed them and stuffed them at first made me extra sad to think of someone stealing pets to taxidermy them and then try and return them for a reward after
UpliftingNews,not_removed,do you have a dorsal fin
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how does an ant farm go missing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i got worms
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the drugs of him being original which he used to be before everyone copied himhe reused his own comedy style
UpliftingNews,not_removed,your sons laughter should have been proof that j c is just a funny dude
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you werent you just had a sense of humour back then jim carrey in the was a comedy genious
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i did the same i was a bit surprised there was a bj scene in the first minutes of ace ventura i dont remember that from when i was younger
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well i assume you were also a child
UpliftingNews,not_removed,which is your favorite ive literally seen when nature calls about times
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are still saying that one missing pet organization in the uk finds a day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you mean seven psychopaths
UpliftingNews,not_removed,einhorn is a man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,well when the title gives the real life pet detective all the credit for finding pets a year people are going to point out the absurdity the title is obviously disingenuous
UpliftingNews,not_removed,im not saying that its right but in their defense they do need to make money to keep it going and if the owners couldnt find the animal theirselves i would think that they would rather pay than never see the pet again
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oliphant
UpliftingNews,not_removed,maybe he is the one that takes them in the first place
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,get well soon ❤
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no no no this is a regular ant farm not an alien one
UpliftingNews,not_removed,annie
UpliftingNews,not_removed,you are too kind thank you you just made my day
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the moral of the story is the only difference between you and a successful version of you is how much you fluff the numbers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah so this is pretty much an april fools post as is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also pretty sure doglost uk is the biggest lost pet service volunteer run and free to use also
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yeah thats per day per person
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jerry you cant just point at dogs being walked by their owners and shout found im and you certainly cant point at birds flying and crawling insects and wild animals that were never pets in the first place thats just not how this works
UpliftingNews,not_removed,its a bit of a quirk of mine lol
UpliftingNews,not_removed,wait you can do that
UpliftingNews,not_removed,whos gonna play bass if flea is missing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sell the dogs more profit
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a crack in the box and a big urge to conquer new lands so basically the mind of a century explorer
UpliftingNews,not_removed,they went underground
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats what were gonna call it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i think he is implying his year old is into heavy fucked up drugs
UpliftingNews,not_removed,no im not they are and the article is i was just quoting for the entire uk that doesnt sound to unfeasible though
UpliftingNews,not_removed,love seeing this under mentioned movie on here haha
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yes but less disappointing
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is that your gun digging into my hip
UpliftingNews,not_removed,duh
UpliftingNews,not_removed,he was great in justified
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oliphaunt actually
UpliftingNews,not_removed,also known as mumakil d
UpliftingNews,not_removed,rconspiracy its also possible that he submitted this post which makes it somewhat of a rkarmaconspiracy whoa
UpliftingNews,not_removed,were any of the ants smooth criminals
UpliftingNews,not_removed,are you ok
UpliftingNews,not_removed,fake it till you make it
UpliftingNews,not_removed,read the article they also count in the pets that were first reported lost and then the owners called again to say they were found so pretty much the majority of pets arent even found by them downvote post and move on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,plus the fact the post would still be a lie its not this one man
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my quirk is that i like to sniff used tampons and furiously finger my own prostate long story short that is why i cant go to sunday school anymore but yeah everyone should read the articles on a reddit post
UpliftingNews,not_removed,only if the urge becomes too much
UpliftingNews,not_removed,does he give it away give it away give it away give it away now

UpliftingNews,not_removed,its also possible the goal is to build up karma to sell his account for marketing purposes that would be rhailcorporate
UpliftingNews,not_removed,why read an article when there are comments
UpliftingNews,not_removed,despite this their efforts shouldnt be commended
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre right i dont know how i messed that up ive seen them perform
UpliftingNews,not_removed,those poor ents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,reminds me of
UpliftingNews,not_removed,the downvote is for the intentionally misleading title not the pet catchers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,eh its moot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,poor saruman who got rekt by the ents
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cocksuckers
UpliftingNews,not_removed,to be fair they are all found because of him he had the idea and the passion to accomplish it he may not literally walk around finding animals a day but he certainly has facilitated finding them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,theyre good groots brent
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thats right woo hang dai
UpliftingNews,not_removed,not according to many of the posts here apparently they count animals that were reported lost and then were found regardless of the agency and include numbers from of thousands of volunteers whose actions itd be a stretch to say this guy way responsible for but maybe those redditors are just a bunch of lying liars too
UpliftingNews,not_removed,swedgen san francisco cocksucka
UpliftingNews,not_removed,so making a website for the volunteers doesnt give him partial credit at least i didnt call anyone a liar at all actually thank you
UpliftingNews,not_removed,i wasnt saying or implying that you called anyone a liar it means he did something yes but it in no way justifies stating that he finds the animals which is what this says
UpliftingNews,not_removed,hes already familiar with out damned spot
UpliftingNews,not_removed,for those of you who dont want to watch a video heres the
UpliftingNews,not_removed,that really seems like something youd wanna use two hands for
UpliftingNews,not_removed,we say singlehandedly but honestly it feels like a dick move to leave out all the work the mother did
UpliftingNews,not_removed,thanks dad
UpliftingNews,not_removed,both times my wife gave birth all the doctor really did was catch the baby when it came out they didnt even call him to come to the hospital until it was time to start pushingand they had her wait until he was there even the nurses were watching out the window in my wifes delivery room waiting for the doc to come driving down the entrance road to the hospital
UpliftingNews,not_removed,youre overthinking it buddy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,yep of the time with childbirth the mother does of the work the regular stuff medical staff does is suctioning airways cutting the cord mostly just treating the baby not the mother the reason to have doctors around is because that other of the time when things go to shit youll really want them
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good boy
UpliftingNews,not_removed,my question is why didnt the person taking the picture go move the hurt dog off the tracks
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this was posted earlier as a gif the dog protecting the injured one was aggressive to strangers who attempted to get close and help
UpliftingNews,not_removed,injured dogs can be rather aggressive my guess is the photographer was scared of getting hurt
UpliftingNews,not_removed,got ya i always wonder on pictures like that what the whole story is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,have you got any sources for this other than brietbart it seems very light on verifiable information
UpliftingNews,not_removed,brietbart news next
UpliftingNews,not_removed,is there a valid news source to read this on
UpliftingNews,not_removed,a breitbart article seriously being reminded of that shithole isnt exactly uplifting regardless of what the news is
UpliftingNews,not_removed,can we keep bullshit nazi news in the disgusting shitlord sewer you found it in please
UpliftingNews,not_removed,oh god i accidentally clicked on the title not knowing it was from breitbart sceeered didnt ever want to visit that psycho bannons exwebsite
UpliftingNews,not_removed,could you maybe not say returns to normal to be sure horrible parenting from the mother hope everything turns out alright
UpliftingNews,not_removed,good thats ridiculous just dont care about gender and if it surfaces respect it if it doesnt continue not caring edit i am by no means trying to ridicule actual transgender people if the child really does end up transgendered then this is just another case of some gender surfacing which should be respected
UpliftingNews,not_removed,jail that mother
UpliftingNews,not_removed,uk doesnt count
UpliftingNews,not_removed,this i dont exactly count brietbart as legitimate news
UpliftingNews,not_removed,breitbart is no less legitimate than fakenews outlets like cnn
UpliftingNews,not_removed,there are no unbiased news sources we all have to do our own vetting
UpliftingNews,not_removed,exactly if gender is socially constructed then you can ignore it in children just let them be the sex they were born
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is every bit less legitimate than cnn its propaganda at best
UpliftingNews,not_removed,false
UpliftingNews,not_removed,how about one thats not so demonstrably and obviously extremely biased to the point that it garners no respect beyond those that already believe its biases
UpliftingNews,not_removed,here is a secret it is all propaganda
UpliftingNews,not_removed,cnn is propaganda cnn is fake news cnn is a big fat mistake
UpliftingNews,not_removed,such as
UpliftingNews,not_removed,unfortunately you appear to have bought in to the lie that no news can be trusted all news has bias that much is true but youre wilfully buying into comment as distinct from news that isnt even attempting to hide editorialising its easier for people with your ideological bent to attempt to smear legitimate sources than pretend your position is either backed by objective truth or is in any way defensible
UpliftingNews,not_removed,sorry i dont play chess with pigeons
UpliftingNews,not_removed,it is easy to see that cnn and the nyt owned by globalists regularly publish false biased and misleading news it is also easy to see that fringe outlets like breitbart often print true and useful pieces that your msm sources will not print that is why nobody trusts the msm anymore d
