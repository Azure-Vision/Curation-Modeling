anime,removed,did they include shiganshina arc in the anime or just the rebellion arc
anime,removed,just wait until their father shows up
anime,removed,the first half was painful i had to skipff through all the bedside speeches except monets since his tsundereing was rather amusing then came the impromptu art session musical montage where everyone was singing again and no worse than king whose entire thing is supposed to be singing id complain about all the sparkles actually curing agasakis condition in addition to bringing her out of the coma but hey its magic i liked their halloween costumes they seemed fitting in the ed play montage it looked like king was going for an actual kiss overall id say it was a pretty entertaining show glad there wasnt really any romance as it wouldve only gotten in the way of the fun but i liked it a lot more before the drama plot kicked in solid
anime,removed,i had to torrent it iirc i found it on nyaa
anime,removed,mgrp did this to a lot of my friends they had such a lovehate too invested to stop now but fuck this show so much going through it
anime,removed,theres only an version available on the seven seas some torrentssites might tell you its but its notguess as an avid anime watcher you can tell the difference my suggestion is to wait to see in theaters or wait for the actual bluray release this dvd version is not good at all
anime,removed,dead mans questions is a ln about kiras afterlife if you felt it was inconclusive
anime,removed,i cant read those ching chong runes
anime,removed,mind that particular fight is just a few quick seconds they hype that encounter almost from the start and i believe recap it briefly after its over as a joke its a good series though but its much heavier on the comedy instead of the action you get scenes like but also ones like
anime,removed,hm love hina source discography my harddrive did you search on bakabt
anime,removed,i didnt consider it a spoiler i wasnt giving away plot details but was explaining the gif was of a single scene and not a short clip from an entire episodic fight if someone had said or does say could you please tag that i think it spoils the episode id have apologized and donedo so instead everyone grabbed torches and pitchforks to solve a simple issue
anime,removed,theres plenty of chimeras in the series not just nina just mentioning them isnt really a joke
anime,removed,and cutting things off too
anime,removed,and noragami
anime,removed,thank you i feel the same way and i thought i was the only one everybodys been raving about how great it was and i just havent seen it ive already watched episodes so im gonna finish it but the last episodes basically everything after they met the seventh has been an absolute borefest and extremely disappointing
anime,removed,out of all the masters he is the only one that remains alive in the end he is also the most inept
anime,removed,right because being forced to risk your life on the battlefield from a young age and having all your friends get brutally slaughtered and the girl you love get raped right in front of your eyes by the man you trusted most in the wold isnt tragic at all
anime,removed,ghost banri ruined it
anime,removed,s again i gave away no plot details i didnt say who won or lost or if anyone died i provided a small bit of context for that gif context that gives nothing away about that scene just in the way it is presented to the audience if for example i presented a gif of the first episode of osamatsusan and followed it up with an explanation that the entire show isnt like this is that a spoiler if it is then how can anyone openly discuss that series unless all discussion is gated behind spoiler tags and if everything is a spoiler than nothing is and lets be honest here people were downvoting me because i was giving away that the gif and the episode itself punks the viewer by being so short it was posted to be a troll and many of the commenters were laughing into their hands over it many other posts in this thread are casually providing more open spoilers about series than i was and they arent being downvoted tag or no tag i would have garnered the same negative response either way bickering about it further is irrelevant now a mod asked me to edit my post which i did because it was a proper requestargument and afaik its been downvoted so hard people cant even see it anymore

anime,removed,kill yourself you tried to be a dick because his tattoo was stupid to you
anime,removed,s suposing that haruka was actually a homophobe i dont really think that shizuru knew that side of her before the scene we are talking about but to be honest im still hesitant about harukas supposed homophobia it looks to me like that what she said to shizuru was something that slipped off in that moment of anger she had been ridiculedtrolled by shizuru for a long time despite her hard work only to find out that she was a rapist and she still had the guts to say something against yukino who committed a mistake as well but haruka didnt know about that haruka wanted to erase that irritating smile from shizurus face at any cost and even if she actually meant those words i wouldnt describe her as a lacking a better word true homophobe it just doesnt fit her character i mean if yukino confessed her love for her would she be disgusted and cut all ties with her if yukino had been bullied for liking girls would haruka support the bullies that doesnt sound like haruka at all if anything i think those thoughts would come from her ignorance and lack ofgoing outside yukino was her only close friend as far as we know i mean i thought that being gay was weird and all that and used gay as an insult when i was little like a lot of kids and then got access to the internet met people at highschool and college and that helped me change my view about a lot of things
anime,removed,there was a great chance to show the of the sisters rivalry beginnings
anime,removed,i dont think its nostalgiajust realistic criticism predigital pen anime can never look as vibrant or consistent as anything made today the lowest budget anime of today has more color than the bigbudget movies of the and their was no physical way to make an anime look like in the art direction is still good by anime standards but the color and art quality was outdated the first time a studio bought wacom pads to color theres only one summarized easily by a jim morrison quote fighting for your right to feel pain is one way of reading it however thats not the only way not even close people have torn it aprt and read it as everything from a postmodernist retelling of genesis to an examiantion of the oedipus complex shinji is after all literally inside his mother for half the series i agree that the rebuilds suck

anime,removed,httpmangalifereadonlinebokunoheroacademia
anime,removed,he even had a hat
anime,removed,pls watch the arc on order to meet the great man that is s condoriano ie con d oriano
anime,removed,yes yes yes yes stain sports festival arc hype
anime,removed,or people in wheelchairs
anime,removed,this is one of the lowest points for subaru in the series if it made you cringe dont worry its intentional
anime,removed,that was an emotional ending though if i had to nitpick a bit it would probably roswaal puck and subarus scene which was also in the ln heres the httpimgurcomaugfeg and since that scene was removed it totally makes roswaal character as that bad guy who wants subaru to be there just to fuck things up while in the ln and manga roswaal purposefully have subaru there to use him as a pawn to help emilia to be a candidate hence why subaru being there would not be as cringy as in the anime because he had a reason like saving emilias candidate seat instead of being a complainer every minutes this is also probably because they removed
anime,removed,they forgot to put the club leader is the most beautiful girl part in their posters after they get approval from the student council they should remember to advertise nagisa
anime,removed,its just hard for now dont worry it will get easier kinda i mean sorta just uh keep watching this episode is supposed to make you dislike subaru and emilia to some point
anime,removed,arc focuses on subarus growth so yes the show is going somewhere with this but first subaru has to hit the rock bottom and he hasnt yet evil smile
anime,removed,he was told not to go and of coarse racism is a factor in modern society he did this to himself
anime,removed,you will love this arc then give it some time p
anime,removed,you have to hate subaru because is intentionally unintentionally a bad anime like mayoiga
anime,removed,ln obviously this was all part of my plan too bad it didnt work anime smirk
anime,removed,subaru did go out of his place but as a manga reader and ln knowledgeable person the anime shielded emilia so hard dafuq is that handholding subaru escort out of the palace they didnt even include emilas last sentence at the end which was actually vital to something s rem says later on
anime,removed,the next three episodes are going to be like this sadly the one after that is when we finally get some relief
anime,removed,a comment i saw on the website where i watch this with some insight to differences between the anime and the manga and the authors view points etc i found very interesting so i thought id copy it over here so you can read it as well well so some rearrangements and cuts were done but its nothing too major i think i will have to talk about some extra info from the novels so bear with me please first of all the anime made roswaal more suspicious than he is supposed to be in the ln he declares that emilia could function as a scapegoat which of course enraged subaru after roswaal tries to take action against him puck intervenes and puts everyone in the throne room to his place he says that he could freeze everyone to death in mere seconds if he wanted but only emilia holds him back obviously this was only a deception to draw out emilias power by doing that she put some respect into the people around her and finally got accepted as a candidate yet her background still was not well seen anyway lets get to the episode dont blindly hate julius now sure one of his reasons for this whole duel was because he tried to protect his and the others honor as a knight but this had also another reason by publicly shaming subaru he basically saved him from a worse fate if subaru took one step outside of the palace the knights would have dragged him into the next alley and kill him on the spot you saw the despising looks of the knights towards him yep that so by giving him an acceptable punishment that is not lethal julius actually saved him now to the candidate the anime kept their declaration of their will rather short so ill go a bit more detail on that first of priscilla well priscilla believes that the kingdom is made to serve her and that she is the only possible choice since she is always on the winner side priscilla had husbands already and all of them died after their death she was always able to turn their land into one of the valuable prosperities there is and through that she gained an immense amount of influence in the kingdom her catchphrase is that she is really good at guessing and that the world is revolving around her will her argument is basically join me and you will be on the winners side next is crusche she has a more radical plan for this kingdom crusch doesnt see any sense in following the dragon anymore she gives a good argument in the manga so ill quote that „dependance brings birth to stagnation which brings birth to corruption and corruption eventually brings destruction people around her are shocked about this because the carsten house has been loyal and close with the royal family for decades now one would think that the head of said house would do everything to please the dragon and fulfill the prophecy so in short she means that they should free themselves from the dependance on the dragon and take their life into their own hand at last there is anastasia anastasia grew up in kararagi where money is basically everything its an economic superpower and people without connections or capabilities in trading will not survive there anastasia worked her way up from the bottom and she developed some kind of unhealthy sense of greed she earns to own more and more when she reaches a milestone it leaves her unsatisfied and she craves for even more which eventually led to her wanting an entire kingdom julius tries to pledge for her even further by arguing that she is one of the best people when its about economics and since this kingdom is in a financial crisis she is the best suited person to lead lugunica into a bright future well emilias declaration could be interpreted in many ways what i clearly hear from her words is equality this equality could applied to many different areas but i think the most logical one is racial equality you know about years prior to these events a racial war waged in this kingdom although this war has ended decades ago there are still consequences within the general population its clear that emilia is the victim of countless racist comments of course this is due to her resemblance with satella but i cant shake off the feeling that this goes even a little bit further than that now to the ending scene well this was the perfect example to show the beautiful characterization in this story first off yes youre supposed to think subaru you deserved this tho yes you can disagree with his actions and if you see faulty in his behavior you and to call him out on that then please do so this is all intentional by the author and he wants you to think freely this is no story where you have to support the protagonists decisions and behavior no matter what no the author is conscious that subaru is faulty from head to toe he knows that and he punishes subaru by taking the most important thing of this world from him to me thats beautiful characterization that isnt linear towards a positive progress if people are backed into a corner provoked and absolutely desperate then they tend to fall back into old patterns imagine an alcoholic that managed to stay clean for months but then suddenly a close person to him died the risk is high that this person is completely overwhelmed by his emotions and thought and eventually stars to drink again this a rather crazy comparison but you get where im coming from subarus character made a jump back in progression but that doesnt mean this isnt progression at all sometimes falling back into your old behavior opens a new door a new chance for you to change oh and let me talk about how humane subaru became by becoming absolutely selfish we expected him to save other people because he wants to and like protagonist number he didnt want anything for it he is happy because the others are safewell thats not how real life works and the author knows that all this time and deep inside subaru had these selfish thoughts but he locked them away now when he became probably the most desperate he has ever been all these build up selfish emotions came to the surfacethe thing is if the other person doesnt remember any of these events then it comes off like how emilia saw it in this scene these are humane interaction and i love them his return by death and these hands are more cruel than ever before for anyone curious the next episodes title was revealed in a magazine since we would have heard about it on friday anyway here a little heads up it is a disease known as despair sounds good huh arc is coming to get us

anime,removed,yuki normally is also willing too but i think koizumi is typically the first to learn of it because his powers are pretty much on the same wavelength as haruhi when she goes and creates a closed space in that sense koizumi is always the first to let anyone know about anything when haruhi has fucked some shit up in the mortal world without creating closed space yuki is the first to tell anyone about it however kyon is always a second tell character to yuki partially because mikuru and koizumi are more useful to deal with it if it can be reversed by their means

anime,removed,nagisa
anime,removed,so i would say i agree that its actually sports blah blah blah but one girl literally performs a judo throw with her nipple after massaging it to make it stand up that actually happens serious sports drama it also devolves into my power beats your power nonsense the outcomes of fights are mostly predictable by understanding the metanarrative they also arent exactly predictable within the universe of the manga because characters just keep pulling new abilities out of their asses pun intended so it is no worse than most shounen battle manga except half of it is ta serious sports drama
anime,removed,its their aniversary so that mean if we take indexrailgun confirmed
anime,removed,that awkward moment when your wife dies from childbirth and you twirl into depression and give your daughter to your inlaws for five years and then you come back to reconnect with the little girl and all is while not great looking better but then your daughter dies too but its k because you collect light orbs and you can make a wish to go back in time so your wife and daughter arent dead anymore

anime,removed,its reasons like that that you dont show up fucking weird ass pedophiles nothing wrong with anime but getting up over a cartoon chick is weird
anime,removed,kys
anime,removed,when i was watching code geass i found it pretty good but nothing too special it felt like a basic anime even though i didnt feel like i disliked it i did finish it fast since i always do that with anime i kinda like but the first season felt only like an while the second season went up to up until the last episode where it blasted through the scale and went probably the best anime ending i have witnessed and will ever witness but things might change now that theres a coming and i found out lelouchs alive which is dropping down the scale again for me unfortunately then i got no game no life which i loved every second of it was something i was expecting for a very long while and it delivered anything i ever wanted until the last episode it was a clear still have it on but i feel since its not finished and it barely has any hope for continuation if they announce another season after the movie then for sure
anime,removed,i hear a lot of talk about this anime in particular as of late will most definitely
anime,removed,i loved this anime so much it was the first blu ray i ripped on my new pc who needs torrents when you can rip them at full quality from discs
anime,removed,i actually have the reverse opinion of you while knowing the ending is cheesy and that it will have no actual consequences it is actually a good direction if lelouch did not take command of britania scheizel will obliterate the shit out of the rebellion and become the next hitler in this ending lelouch gets to end the war with the least casualty and then what happens after is just his retirement from the political scene after all the shits he went through in seasons knowing he entrusted it to the right hands or so he thought
anime,removed,sigh alright i cant decide tho so have a bunch from musaigen no phantom world from anitore nsfw from macross delta again with these naughty pics from ll sunshine from shoujotachi wa kouya wo mezasu and shame on you from netoge guess i have to go to church on christmas eve now
anime,removed,tokyo magnitude had me fucking fooled im also to blame for expecting a happy ending about siblings experiencing a giant earthquake together but this show broke my heart
anime,removed,im pretty bummed that my submission of httpimgurcomxdlmedq didnt get added people just hating on my anime preferences
anime,removed,im actually positively convinced that if steinsgate didnt have an ending where the protagonist wins that many less people would have liked it part of the deal with young peoples anime recommendations is that they love insurmountable odds being beaten especially if the mc himself is nearly invincible thats kind of why im looking forward to the premise revolves around okarin failing and fills in the gaps in all the time that he gets to the true ending feels like it will get fleshed out a lot more
anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,
anime,removed,if shes so great why didnt s win
anime,removed,shes a clone anyway
anime,removed,wait who is rem
anime,removed,she should have been the one
anime,removed,man i feel like s at this point they avoided the whos rem scene with her permanent demise just so they could milk this stuff as hard as possible they clearly know their obsessive fanbase would be nuclear as soon as they caught wind that rem is gone for good so they want them to buy as much merch and bluerays as they can before theyre forced to reveal it in the obvious to come
anime,removed,damn them bakas didnt know is there anything else other than k projectdownload at from nyaa
anime,removed,what level autism do i need for this
anime,removed,crunchyroll is you like paying money or you can sail the high seas for it russian smooch will have it i can pm you the link if you want
anime,removed,i think thats only with transplant eyes madara used it and he was fine plus the reverse power was created to stop the stalemates it created kakashis kamui also makes him go blind but obito gets to use it more often with no repercussions
anime,removed,did she just rape him
anime,removed,i would wanna fuck her if she was that cute
anime,removed,its not so much the difficulty its partially that i dont like the illegal methods though i will make exceptions for ovas but even more so i dont want to watch a show thats any more difficult to watch than pulling up the app on my and watching it though last time i tried finding a good torrent site i couldnt find a place that was particularly convenient or that made me feel like i could trust it either way i dont see the need since theres already more shows than i have time to watch on crunchyroll alone
anime,removed,rezero
anime,removed,golden time was almost a for me then the ghost banri attacked still love it though
anime,removed,garbage aside from truckkuns appearance hes so far this seasonand will be at least
anime,removed,i finished attack on titan season but definitely not watching season the premise is just so stupid for me first the concept of the titans are so dumb they eat humans not out of instinct in the sense of prey and predator but just for the sake of extermination okay so with that logic titans offensive must be some coordinated race vs race attack on humans but then you see that titans are just basically huge zombies with some weirdos mixed in stupid but something we can get past next you find out that humans have built these huge walls to keep them out sure why not makes sense then you learn that they also have the technology to make these grappling hook machinery technology thats meant to kill the titans because of a certain vulnerability looks cool right wtf you could have used the same effort to just build better fucking cannons that blow up the whole head of the titan including the weak part or you know just drop rocks on their heads cause you have that huge wall as a vantage point dont get me started on people transforming into titans people tell me to just read the manga and everything will be explained there but if i had to get information to connect everything from a second source then its just bad story telling if you tell a casual fan that before watching a marvel movie you need to read x comics so that you can understand the plot you think people would still go and watch their movies attack on titan just triggers me like nothing else in the anime world rant
anime,removed,because doormat fans would have to leave the house for that
anime,removed,no one cares all true anime fans use torrents and we dont want some half baked indie developer to make railgun
anime,removed,
anime,removed,might not want to read the manga or stay watching the series then
anime,removed,ive finished idolmaster cinderella girls and started witch craft works i really liked the idolmaster series full of cute girls and some nice drama inbetween although the end arc about how the main girl felt left behind was pretty similar to how the ending in idolmaster was done but i still enjoyed all of it witch craft works seems really cool especially the main heroine is kinda waifu material
anime,removed,
anime,removed,didnt everyone die in akame ga kill except for akame
anime,removed,is this a rewatch whatever the case im joining now gonna start this series as currently watching let me join the hype and understand some references
anime,removed,httpiimgurcomvkpmekdjpg gintamacrushed he really has a huge range of voice thats why i think he is by far one of the best voice actors in the industry
anime,removed,that she liked his friend i think
anime,removed,looooooooool aki being a bitch will be the least of your complaints once that fat fucking piece of shit gets screentime
anime,removed,anohana was what i was gonna recommend personally while your lie was a good show anohana was better might have to do with the fact that i dont necessarily find the death of a character sad but instead its how it affects people that is emotional an example s i didnt get emotional when hughes died it wasnt until the funeral when mustang says ah looks like its beginning to rain doesnt look like it no its raining all right that the feels hit me hard
anime,removed,because despite the fact that its ran for so long the main character has only lost twice it was good at first but after a while it became really obvious that the main character was going to win every single time
anime,removed,i just love that with the nasuverse concept of origins kara no kyoukai shows us characters whose origins are interesting complicated abstract concepts like emptiness consumption worthlessness stillness nostalgia and refutation even in fate kiritsugus origin is severing and binding then you have shirou whose origin is sword
anime,removed,not the same guy but like your opinion man bad shows have movement in the opening im sure the actual show whatever it may be as i dont recognize it has plenty of still dialogue just like any show
anime,removed,she woulda been such a good char d
anime,removed,nina tucker is best doggirl
anime,removed,gon spoiler
anime,removed,s in episode when ed breaks down after killing greed
anime,removed,if its funny or not is opinionated but its still a joke nonetheless do your research on animation before you make such a stupid statement this is clearly one of the high points in the series its not fair in comparison youre clearly missing the point
anime,removed,going off your re zero pick my favorite from that show is rem going into her demon form for the first time against the mabeasts that still gives me goosebumps the music and voice actor mixed together is perfect sorry for the horrible border in the video
anime,removed,im glad it didnt get one of those fairy tail cliche endings
anime,removed,i highly recommend people watch fuuka its a truckload of fun for everyone truly aoty material

anime,removed,kill all the japanese
anime,removed,i dont know what anime is that but the line s dont act like you understand them just because you read little in the net is so good
anime,removed,you forgot s the new fuukas father is the truck driver lol
anime,removed,wait are you really using this clip as something that doesnt have still frames are you blind or something
anime,removed,almost everything that happens in death note after ls death that near kid or whatever his name was literally deduced all his infomations out of nowhere it made no sense
anime,removed,your arguments are jokes as for evidence how about the mako gags that filled out most of every episode or the fight with that had a grand total of different frames only to cite a few examples good luck with youre shit good luck with your literacy test bitch
anime,removed,but why is father ancient and wizened now if he had half of the souls of the kingdom this is just my theory but i think he intentionally aged his appearance up to look more wise and fatherly it certainly fits with s the general phoniness that the truth faults him for the more godly body he creates for himself after he absorbs god and pride being able to change selims apparent age
anime,removed,which part the dying or the getting out of paralysis getting out of the paralysis was an ass pull the not dying bit is up for interpretation it could be an ass pull but theres two theories that make sense being the conditions of the duel heathcliff not letting asuna kill herself this one is a stretch but not impossible or since they both won but they both died its not impossible to see that he could have let both of them live since they beat him together he also doesnt come across as a bad person in their various chats at least not after years of fighting alongside these people whose deaths he was responsible for and he designed he medicuboid so its not impossible that he could have let them both live because they beat him
anime,removed,why did fuuka cross the road answer to be a huge hit
anime,removed,finally i just wonder how it possible could end tho like even who wins the world is already destroyed is it not
anime,removed,i think many people including med agrees it went downhill the moment you know who died but still remain to be a great series overall
anime,removed,revival activates when something tragic is about to happen close to satoru this is actually pretty debatable does he go back in time because his mom got killed or because he was about to get arrested for his mom getting killed i always assumed it was because his mom got killed in that case he would be going back in time to change something bad that already happened not about to happen if he only went back once i think it would of been fine to have basically no explanation the fact that he hearts of the cards the time travel i think the writer should of explained the power a bit more towards the end at one point the doctor says something about them doing experiments on him or something like that i thought it was going to be an abre los ojos thing but it wasnt
anime,removed,truckkun slicing life
anime,removed,and mins of shinji strangling asuka make it hours and we have a deal
anime,removed,there was something like years from when mitsuha would have been able to recognize taki and about years where they both would be able to recognize each other wait can you explain this part to me why those specific years
anime,removed,so knocked out
anime,removed,i hope she masturbates over asuka
anime,removed,barakamonnotcool take a gun and kill yourself with it
anime,removed,with his right arn
anime,removed,wille didnt rescue shinji they captured him to make sure nerv didnt get to him first they dont want him because hes an asset they want him locked up because hes a threat
anime,removed,there are many ways to do fanservice the children main cast conveniently dont age asuka new postapocalyptic clothes are a bit too trendy for the world she lives in all adult characters get new looksmodels and even new unimportant side characters have weirdly fashionable looks we get a fucking airship eva made of crappy cgi polygons hideaki just wanted to burn through the budget with this one we get eva and changing forms and wielding a whole new array of weaponstools in nonsensical fights that are too much choreographed one after the other you know what this means tons and tons of new memorabilia and toys and other crappy merchandise that the fans will buy compulsively thats what that movie was a giant not so subtle promotion of a whole new moneygrabbing campaign from start to end
anime,removed,do you want to hear a joke s wwe

anime,removed,nope but his ex appears
anime,removed,yeah the fact that fz didnt properly explain the game is one of my biggest gripes with the show the show is sentences of dialogue away from being completely self contained here are some general rules to defeat someone you only need to kill their servant when you do they are officialy out of the game unless they someohow can get a new one hovever some might prefer to try to kill the master instead since they are not as strong and their servant will wanish from lack of mana in theory to win and get the grail you dont need to kill anyone you just need to findsummon the grail and use it hovever the grail gets more powerful the more people die in the grail war so your wish might require a lot of deaths to be achieved no one has won the grail before fz master and servant dont have to be near eachother to fight
anime,removed,k first off most people who started this show knew from the beginning that the people that did aot did this show as well so you have multiple red flags just starting the show to clue you in for the rinse and repeat about to take place you have kabane vs humans which is just like aot with titans vs humans man vs nature humans are all locked up in fortresses to keep the kabanetitans out due to the outside world being overrun city falls just like aot but on a larger scale then aot i admit but nonetheless the bubble of safety is broken mc becomes a hybrid just like aot mc kabane have a single weak spot to permanently remove them as do the titans in aot in the op we are shown the outline of a man in dark foreboding way which alludes to the fact this will change from man vs nature to man vs man just like aot did also both the mcs from aot and kabaneri both have the same exact motivation which is to kill all of the kabanetitans due to their feelings of weakness when their family member was taken from them due to the kabanetitans as for dialogue and animation it all looks fine no major changes from episode in my view this is all from just episodes of the show and its very clear on which path this show is going to go down to pretend otherwise is choosing to be blind to whats in front of you you may not like it but a circlejerk is exactly what this is and the rest of the story just as it was from the beginning is laid out right in front of you
anime,removed,glad to see an adaptation going past the golden age seeing that carriage girl knowing full well what will happen to her made me smile
anime,removed,saw naked farnese on guts horse spoiler horse hype
anime,removed,rape horse confirmed
anime,removed,lol i know mirai nikki is not the most highly acclaimed pieces of writing but it was fun already seen it assuming you can stomach the occasional s yukiteru instatntly forgiving his father after stealing his parachute and abandoning him for dead on top of a collapsing tower then stabbing his mother to death
anime,removed,damn im on mobile so this is going to be difficult its am where i am but thats no excuse to not be salty ranime ill find a salt gif later mini challenges whats the biggest weakness of your best girl best girls dont have weaknesses thats why theyre the best whats the nicest aspect of your least favorite girl i dont have a least favorite girl since that requires having more than one favorite but if i did then she would have a wonderful smile nice personality and likes to cook lol jk fuck that shes gotta be thiccccck i can try to post my votes so everyone can see my shit tastes but ill have you know two of these pairs were very hard choices you know which ones
anime,removed,okuyasu only has one solo fight but i thought it was a very good one and once again shows the importance of good tactical foresight and creative power usage in jojo both the hand and rhcp have essentially one line descriptions of their power erases things from existance and turn into electricity become more powerful with more electricity but their difference in intelligence and creativity is what makes rhcp so much more dangerous
anime,removed,s the next few lines are perfect for the show
anime,removed,i just dont get it why everyone is bashing the whole cgi thing why cant we be happy that were actually getting past the golden age adaptations on the other note if the season ends with guts fighting s that priest basturd then i cant wait for the revival of s gay batman wait i mean griffith
anime,removed,and freaking macross delta is

anime,removed,i agree its definitely a great community well except for its constant disappointment in its contests kukuku
anime,removed,her voice feelsgoodman i am a bit of an audiophile autism causes me to be super sensitive to perception especially touch and hearing so that could be a huge factor in it
anime,removed,keep in mind that cr along with viz and funimation through hulu have very strong back catalogs on top of their simulcasts they certainly do and the exclusion of subtitled anime in its original language is a dealbreaker alone he has a point however in that the community isnt served by crunchyrolls subpar video quality and onscreen typesetting in the age of uhd programming on amazon and netflix im sure we can also look forward to more instances of shoehorned social commentary like what happened with prison school fansubbers have all three beaten on their products price aside and they usually just record from television talk over irc make the subtitles with aegisub and only have torrents or xdcc with which to share their work they arent even usually paid to do what they do and theyre putting out better work than whats officially available

anime,removed,theres some initial minimoments of potential romance but it never turns into any sort of actual confessionhandholdingdatesrelationshipopen discussion of feelings because of the premise older guy in teenage body so hes constantly being told not to be a pedo
anime,removed,same kind of cringy shoujo drama as the rose of versailles but with skinnier legs and more open faggotry
anime,removed,having read the spoilers of the thing that happens in chapter im really thorn between dropping this one because its kinda bad except for fuukas design and some of her personality or keep watching it in order to feel the full effect of this sub exploding when the thing that happens in chapter happens
anime,removed,too much bites za dusto starts to make the show drag
anime,removed,nonexistent while obviously this thread is for bashing im going to correct this one thing because im very tired of seeing it the main thing is that its really slow within this regard so its hard to notice not subtle thats wrong also debate over whos really god

anime,removed,🤔
anime,removed,um like evangelion spoilers
anime,removed,to be fair killua said that his father could do the same without a drop of blood in the version though im sure nen plays a role in that technique
anime,removed,i found this channel interesting
anime,removed,i dont see why you wouldnt hes still the same character just in a different body
anime,removed,that other batch story time
anime,removed,i return from the void just in time for this rewatch good timing on my part welcome back i dislike anthy for being so submissive but thats probably what the show is about so its not a mark against the show with my current understanding i think its a major part of her being the rose bride obviously well have to watch more before we can say anything more saionji for being a bad guy without motivation im also hoping for motivation explanation to perhaps alleviate and provide background to his currently dickish character
anime,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvogwjxnzpae didnt they akkos sprout was adorable sucy has been great so far and cavendish should be punished for plucking it im having a hard time believing that akko knew what the cocoons were better than cavendish just because she played magic the gathering does anyone know whether this is meant to be standalone from the movies i feel like theyre beating us over the head with chariots secret identity so are they going to make a big thing out of her reveal or is it just gonna be episodes of winks and nods one day akko will be good enough to bring her friend
anime,removed,like the misaka clones in railgun
anime,removed,s the girl in question did have a lot of support with those fairies though
anime,removed,cant wait for all the doujins that are gonna be spawned from this new series i think sucy is probably the lewdest one by default but i bet diana could dominate hard atsuko would be the best for defloweringthemed works
anime,removed,unfortunately need to remove this due to certain illegal watermark i can reapprove it if said watermark is censored
anime,removed,well if youd consider madoka to be homuras damsel then theres that
anime,removed,holo and lawrence did didnt they
anime,removed,do you have aspergers jesus read behind the lines dude
anime,removed,dianes reaction to the teachers struck me as a flaw that i saw in the original series the plot and dialogue arent very strong like akko is too silly sometimes for instance when she tried to get the statue to move i just thought that it was cringey additionally shiny chariot the teacher is just too clumsy it was charming but already overdone imo i think there were a lot of things i excused in the ova and movie because they were extremely short on time that i cant with a full fledged series while im still enjoying the series i dont think its going to be a for me the visuals and sounds are enough to knock it all the way up to at a minimum but the writing looks like its going to drag honestly i thought that this would be the aots to compete with rakugo but i think im enjoying psycho loli a lot more than this
anime,removed,considering the outcome of the show somewhere in hell maybe
anime,removed,pretty colors time resets and muh feels
anime,removed,my favorite part was the possible foreshadowing of one of the great nine witches has the same maybe sc is a descendant of one of them
anime,removed,
anime,removed,would love a code to watch anime before i go to sleep if you could pm it to me d thank you
anime,removed,「どんなに長くなっても、みんなが略称を付けてくれるから」との声もあった。 some have also said that no matter how long the title is were just going to abbreviate it anyway
anime,removed,should be easy there arent many white things in the pool ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
anime,removed,httpasenshimoe
anime,removed,dialogue over trippy shots is like of monogatari the remaining is trippy fanservice and
anime,removed,make the clinton family unable to lie
anime,removed,oh just watched it on gogoanime though
anime,removed,girls are sexy get over it cuck
anime,removed,inverse i constantly pissed off when i dont really like a sub favourite because it wasnt my cup of tea but clearly i have no taste or intelligence
anime,removed,s at least they arent actually related by blood or so i have heard
anime,removed,how about telling me when someone releases a torrent thatll be real news
anime,removed,gakkou gurashi sol i beg your pardon
anime,removed,it appears that the most passionate fans vote a bit differently including huge initial upsets in adventure and comedy which of course turned into nothing as soon as the vote numbers went into high hundreds am i missing something or is this a slight spoiler on the winners p
anime,removed,ranimes discord wait where can i find this
anime,removed,im probably gonna be sat on fire for saying this but i didnt think it was all that good i mean the animation was goodthe story was alright i guess still dont quite get what actually caused the guy to dream himself into her soul or whatever happened like was it some extraterrestrial force magic divine intervention
anime,removed,can someone pm me a pass
anime,removed,well if you think about it logically what op is saying is at the start of the votes some underdog was leading in votes thus initial upsets after it hit the frontpage adventure and comedy categories started to change in votes turning initial upsets into nothing as soon as the vote numbers went up so we can safely assume that the adventure andor comedy categories might have the most obvious winners eg rezero and konosuba
anime,removed,the best animated movie ive seen from any country is wolf children its an anime movie from japan and you can buy it at best buy its the first bluray i bought and the second one i owned i bought it on amazon because it was cheaper than best buy and then before it arrived i bought the newsroom season on bluray in a brickandmortar shop and owned it for almost a year before i actually owned a bluray player because i knew i was going to get one and wasnt about to pay for it in sd plus i had an hd copy on my hard drive i could watch in the meantime so i wanted to have paid for hd on disc not bashing this movie i havent seen it but im not disappointed by the release timing anime is a bit wonky when it comes to sales most of it is priced so working people cant buy it series anyway like i love erased but im not dropping on it others cost significantly more when its free and easy albeit illegal to stream them on ka or torrent them they really need to be making sales to people who would pay for them but you know they have to pay rent and paying a months rent or buying an anime on bluray well its a pretty easy call im not saying they should give them away but a episode series should cost no more than and thats high i dont need the art book and all the fancy shit i just want the discs and a good copy with the english audio track and to know im supporting the stuff i like without putting myself on the street anyway it is my hope that more people see good anime movies and buy them in stores or online online is usually cheaper and amazon is legit and that more get made best buy wants like for wolf children or they did when i saw it in the store but i got it on amazon for like and it comes with the dvd as well
anime,removed,if it cannot break out of its shell the chick will die without ever being born we are the chick the world is our egg if we dont crack the worlds shell we will die without ever truly being born smash the worlds shell for the revolution of the world what a great chant get use to this youll be hearing it a lot now my least favourite character has been introduced a monkey called chuchu who like penpen from evangelion is a product of its time back in the where little animal sidekicks were very popular staple but i honestly never l liked the little critter he does gives us insight to anthys true feelings at some points and is important to her in the series also heres the start to a long line of shit that happens to saionji cause of his assholish actions
anime,removed,i get it you dont like criticism of your middle schooler wankbait show get over yourself fanboy and move on to better shows
anime,removed,youre gonna need to go through this and add spoiler tags i havent removed the comment because it should be pretty obvious by context and its already fairly popular but something of this size really does need to be properly tagged
anime,removed,this comment has been removed this comment has been reported as containing untagged spoilers please review for any tags you may have missed and reply to this message to have your post reapproved self and link posts should have in the title as well as the names of the shows self posts may opt to tag spoilers in the self post instead comments should use s spoilerchan died to protect spoilers spoiler source should at a minimum contain the relevant source of the spoiler eg one piece episode or if its from a different medium lnmangavn have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,removed,god that show had the worst ending ever shoulda named the show fuck slain over

anime,removed,who
anime,removed,he actually looks a lot like reina wait ive seen enough kill la kill to know where this is going
anime,removed,let me provide some russian perspective lilia baranovskaya is obviously inspired by maya plisetskaya maya is apparently where yurios last name comes from she is probably the best ballerina that ever lived she passed away last year at the age of and was kicking ass till the end httpiimgurcomkdolpebjpg httpiimgurcomzmjseiypng ayy i love our sports uniforms theyre awesome seems to be rather rare though they dont sell it anymore and the only picture i could find usually the uniform with those ornaments is rendered either in hot red or in deeper blue some more options httpiimgurcomxfrifeojpg this years collection it is inspired by the early century avangardists and the hottest russian designer atm gosha rubchinsky kinda weird since the brand is in the championships name but im guessing it counts as advertisement not russian unique or anything but lmao all of yuris fangirls had and only they had neko ears
anime,removed,autists
anime,removed,i actually think rezero was super overrated and rem was pretty dumb i mean she went from wanting to brutally kill subaru with a chained mace thing to sucking his dick in a few days
anime,removed,the only fight scene i can think of thats really good is s al vs kimblee and pride but its over so quickly
anime,removed,there is a bluray torrent somewhere good quality
anime,removed,psa you can torrent anime and people have really cheap seedboxes if youre a nice person
anime,removed,ive watched and finished flip flappers fune wo amu keijo lostorage incited wixoss magical girl raising project occulticnine shuumatsu no izetta scorching ping pong girls yuri on ice gakuen handsome and the final part of jojo part i have giarlish number and sangatsu on hold and im also keeping up with trickster best show flip flappers indisputably speaking personally i feel like the gap between flip flappers and every other show this season is so wide that anyone who doesnt have it as their either didnt watch it is a fujoshi or is just wrong mind you theres never been a show ive felt this strongly abouteven my previous best show ever gatchaman crowds id give room for people to not like but flip flapper is justwhat can i even say about it it does gayness better than yuri on ice it manages to make actual social critique it makes you use your brain the ost is toptier the sakuga is obvious its a classic exceptional coming of age story plus it has papika no other show has papika honorable mentions to scorching ping pong girls and jojo part though best op in case you missed it in any of the seven weekly threads this goes to scorching ping pong girls also the best op this year it does everything an op needs to doperfectly show off what the show is aboutin this case hypermoe cgdct actions and insanemindblowinglyoverthetop ping pong action sounds unique puts you in the exact mindset needed to watch the show is impeccably directed and intime with the musicseriously everything to the character cards is pointperfect they went so far above and beyond for this moe ping pong show i dont know my dudes honorable mentions flip flappers for most emotional fune wo amus jojo part best ed as is becoming the theme this award goes to flip flappers httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmgkjpdbnae an almosthaunting lullaby filled to the brim with foreshadowing love and beautiful art during the show itself they even manage to harness the roundabout factor like jojo used to and bleed the instrumentals at the beginning into the ed itself it manages to improve a lot of cliffhangers and scenes plus feel good honorable mentions tricksters the best part of the show occulticnines httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmfvolvnwkcq scorching ping pong girls magical girl raising projects yeah this season was fucking stacked best dude is there any other choice besides im also partial to too but im not sure if they count as a boy since their gender identity is something of debate i also wanna shout out to who somehow managed to come out of yuri on ice as my favorite character worst dude oh boy did anyone but me watch wixoss and see i know the answer is no but holy shit edgy mcdespair man has nowhere near the charisma to pull off being an antagonist like he is ostensibly were supposed to like him because hes the dr ver archtypeabsolutely batshit too busy smelling his own farts to pay attention to everything one bad day from fucking killing everyone only manages to keep power by sheer force of how much people like him but in reality he only managed to remind us why dr ver worked you wouldnt see the bookmaker coming out of nowhere like dr ver does you wont find the bookmaker shitposting on about how hes the last action hero you wont find the bookmaker with a badass ridiculous name like john wayne vercingetorix not to mention dr ver barely manages to work in his own show because symphogear is so insane and silly you just nod along with it putting him in a darknesstype show like wixoss just doesnt fucking work other bad male characters include the entire male cast of wixoss and the entire male cast of shuumatsu no izettayeah this season confirmed to me that every show would be better if we just murdered all the dudes except symphogear i guess best worst girl seriously i get what the author was going for with swim swim but it was just too much why fucking kill all the interesting characters but keep the one static one as the villain i dont get it honorable mentions the entire cast of lostorage incited wixoss and the entire cast of shuumatsu no izetta starting to catch a theme okay hanna and piriluk managed to be alright in the former biggest disappoint ooooh where to begin at the beginning of the season i had shuumatsu no izetta pegged as the best show this season instead i got a masturbatory pronazi fanfic in lieu of spending more words hating on it im going to just link to yuri on ice was personally disappointing lostorage incited wixoss ive already mentioned a bunch as bad and that sucks for me but i kinda expected it only mari okada and can write the type of story the original wixoss was and whoever the fucko who was writing this wixoss was not mari okada or instead i got the blandest fucking edgy despair show ive seen in a while yawn im still a sucker and will watch lostorage conflacted wixoss because selector was good though biggest surprise flip flappers obviously i went into the show with marginal expectations and at the end of the first episode i was convinced the most baffling part is that every episode after continued to surprise and impress me theres just so much occulticnine was surprising as well for other reasonsprimarily the impeccable directing and tatami galaxyjoshirakulevel pacing it manages to elevate what would otherwise be average source material into something genuinely great plus i dont know how you could not like are just so big and so wellanimated the biggest mystery of the show after all is how she handles all that weight scorching ping pong girls also wasnt a show i was even watching for the first half of the season but someone on rtrueanime convinced me to give it a chance around week and i was hooked i know haikyuu aired this season but seriously i cant recommend this show enough if you want hype sports actionits just so intense easily best season of the year
anime,removed,okso for jojo manga readers in sc why was jotaros mother recovered as soon as dio was defeated in diu why jotaro could not stop time longer than when he fought dio did he stopped using his stand also maybe that was explained in the anime and i didnt pay attention thats why this is the thread to ask thanks
anime,removed,aria series
anime,removed,wait till gon s super saiyan
anime,removed,i watch anime the good one and the wrost one i watch anime on my free time i am am anime connosewer after my days hour minute i am still not tiredi watched attak on titan on crunchyroll on friday pm but sometime i watch later because my mom makes me go to afterschool i like anime because it is fun my favorite anime is sword art online mirai nikki and elfen lied mangaka is great and is a genius who dont like attack on titan is a bully hater and a jelaous and are biashad to review thsi awesome anime

anime,removed,lold
anime,removed,toradora titan souma naruto lol
anime,removed,i havent read the manga but i do know what happened from browsing rmanga and some friends s the main girl who is the series is named after gets run over by a truck and dies pretty early into the series and apparently this series is a sequel to a series called suzuka and the girl who died is the daughter of the main characters of suzuka which is from the same creator
anime,removed,i still think gon vs pitou was the biggest scene i will say the end to the arc was highly unexpected
anime,removed,shes gonna murder all the magical girls there
anime,removed,httpiimgurcomgbvfaqppng
anime,removed,
anime,removed,rezero despite every horse beating it gets it was glorious watching an autistic kid too beta to get a gf ending up as a butler screwing up everything ten times and getting brutally murdered over and over in a sea of of terror and suffering and him triumphing in the end too of course
anime,removed,how bout
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,httpiimgurcomudlbiiugif nsfw
anime,removed,she was also ripping of mechas armor iirc
anime,removed,i dont know about gunbuster but in diebuster one the main characters does this very same thing it reference to the original to rip open the chest of her at that point movement controlled mech to put a new powercoreheart into it
anime,removed,mayoiga jojo lmao this list
anime,removed,yeah rebellion never happened right
anime,removed,just curious why does it matter if the dog was the culprit its not like it was an actual dog it was a demon disguised as a dog so it could lure kids into the woods it wasnt just the dog either there was an enemy among the kids as well so your complaint here makes it sound like you were looking for a way to bash a show you didnt fully pay attention to
anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,can we stop this anime fans are so bad
anime,removed,kyuubey too
anime,removed,as a matter of fact in recent years ive found a lot less cunts in the anime community than i have found in say art film students pretentious boring and condescending music fans cancer or gaming communities somehow even worse than either of the previous ones compared to those the anime community is pretty chill maybe a few too many edgy dank maymay with berserk avatars but for the most part people seem to respect each others taste more often
anime,removed,this comment has been removed untagged or improperly tagged spoilers are not allowed repeated violations of this rule will result in a ban have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,removed,im more interested in what happens after fatherson fight
anime,removed,yar har fiddle de de everybody im pretty hyped for this weeks episode lets hope my internet doesnt die in the middle of watching this time so i can update this comment with my thoughts on the episode in a timely manner
anime,removed,fatezero was a big ad to sell not only the bds fatezero is the only installment in the series which makes heavy allusions to philosophy mythology and religion the others briefly touch on the subject by anecdote only hardly an advertisement but in fact the most powerful and complex installment in the franchise i encourage you to read s biblical revelation nietzsches thus spoke zarathustra beyond good and evil on the genealogy of morality twilight of the idols and the antichristian but also sumerianakkadian myths like the epic of gilgamesh the entire history of the greeks and persians etc were talking about anime here not vns the op has nothing to do with that and the other anime do not include an intro the grail war
anime,removed,maybe you guys are talking about the second episode discussion of little witch academia the spanish subs were out way before the english were released and a few discussion threads were posted but many complained that the english werent out eventually leading to the threads being removed until the english fansub was released
anime,removed,i feel like youre basically looking for rage moments or what my friend calls super saiyan moments naruto has a lot involving nine tails you can probably just look up naruto nine tails fights but the one i remember happens in the pain arc gintama has a couple with the mc but the one i remember is kagura vs abuto inoubattle apparently has one but ive never seen it and its apparently a huge spoiler so ive never looked up the details the last scene in tokyo ghoul season is really good though no one is around to witness it and be amazed except you similar to the nine tails gimmick is the hollow mask in bleach ichigo vs ulqiuorra is a good one a lot of battle harem shows are based around this gimmick and often have at least one of these scenes saijaku muhai no bahamut and asterisk war are two that cone to mind a lot of people already mentioned this but the roy mustang one is very good if you stretch you could say evangelion and evangelion have a scene like this with eva vs eva i think you might have mentioned this but seven deadly sins protagonist has this gimmick i think theres one in fate zero involving the servant rider but i havent seen enough of them to tell you details but if you like fight scenes in general fatezero is a must boku no hero academia has one but its a pretty good show i would watch the whole thing to get the full impact rezero kinda has one in the second arc involving rem honorable sao kirito vs floor boss mention
anime,removed,is that the part where shinishi is too late
anime,removed,the final episode of katanagatari he doesnt need to keep the swords in one piece
anime,removed,japanese cat sound has them
anime,removed,yes
anime,removed,i dont hate her personality but what she did at the end of koyomi should make me hate her but we werent shown much of as to why she did what she did so im holding out on hating her
anime,removed,well as said it is all there on the japanese cat sound

anime,removed,how about a look at the highly anticipated third season
anime,removed,it did end up giving us some satisfying though
anime,removed,you can try websites for movie subs the problem is that most english sub groups dont include srt ass files with the torrent which is not commonplace for other languages pretty much every chinese group includes them
anime,removed,
anime,removed,its still a signature move kittan only used it because he was in possession of gls drill and finally managed to experience true spiral energy
anime,removed,thanks for preventing people to enjoy their animes
anime,removed,hypocrites
anime,removed,oh you want a male kobayashisan just give it a few episodes

anime,removed,yo op took a look at your mal here is my opinion you have a need for other people to like and admire you and yet you tend to be critical of yourself while you have some personality weaknesses you are generally able to compensate for them you have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage disciplined and selfcontrolled on the outside you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside at times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing you prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations you also pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others statements without satisfactory proof but you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others at times you are extroverted affable and sociable while at other times you are introverted wary and reserved some of your aspirations tend to be rather unrealistic well

anime,removed,nina tucker dog version from fma
anime,removed,classic
anime,removed,they could easily finish in two but instead they fleshed out the story and characters the most they could and for the last episode they will s korosenseis death and a year timeskip
anime,removed,bibadidnothingwrong
anime,removed,come aboard and bring aloooong all your hopes and dreams together we will find evrything that were looking foooor
anime,removed,lots of people die in random and sometimes hilarious ways in that show his was probably the most boring
anime,removed,
anime,removed,s boats too
anime,removed,for the worse it was fine as a fun not to intodepth plot show they turned it into a show that kept viewers for shock value o that newspaper boy he was the eye patch girl shock adds nothing to the plot whatsoever o whats that a nice back story for the main villain girl well she and the heroine were sisters all along shock adds nothing to the plot oh look a randomly placed time skip arc where the main character went to spiderman levels of emotion but but pushed to fight again shock literally no point in in that entire idea so much of the latter half of the show consisted in unneeded plot points that didnt add anything to the plot except shock value no real story progress the writers are good at making a ridiculous show with interesting action scenes they arent good with in depth plot shows also shown by part of trigger writing kiznaiver and having no direction for the story to go the story could have been written on the spot for kill la kill it had nice music interesting animation but story wasnt one of those nice things
anime,removed,everyone can see new here
anime,removed,cody in the house
anime,removed,yuru yuri
anime,removed,i love that scene from the beach episode s mio is touched by yui guitar performance as the fireworks sets behind her and the bgm changed to calm instrumental so nice
anime,removed,there are way too many things i love about the show to dial it down to just one the animation the music all the characters s sawakos death devil scene s tenshi ni fureta yo s the classroom concert s yui losing her voice and mio having to sing fuwa fuwa time there are way too many fantastic moments its just too perfect
anime,removed,httpimgurcomtmldcof solves a rubiks cube in jojos bizarre adventure
anime,removed,hits the hardest because i was expecting s her to come back and hugs her because shes happy she can ride or something but it didnt happen it kinda enforces the idea of watching your own child growing up and therell come a time where you realize that theyll carry their own path on their own but you will always look after them even if its only from the back now im sad ugh whyyyyyy
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i was annoyed by ubw but still liked it a bit for the art and a few interesting characters one thing i would heavily disagree with most critics on is shirous ideals theyre just about the only thing in the anime that make sense and ive never really seen a criticism of them other than an unargued statement that theyre silly this actually made the anime quite irksome s that the anime revolved so much around shirous ideals being dumb without actually explaining what made them dumb and then brushed off the criticism near the end by claiming sincerity had something to do with the debate made all of the ethical dilemmas fall flat on their face for me so i put it out to you lot since this seems to be the thread why do people dislike shirous ideals s also the idea that shirou could last more than a second against gilgamesh is fucking dumb no your excuses dont make sense
anime,removed,s santa bear comes to town
anime,removed,its these comments that prove someone didnt give it a chance at all sorry if i seem defensive i just hate that people judge this show so harshly because they think its just gonna be saitama one punching everything one punch man isnt about a bald guy killing bad guys its about the world the sea king and other later fights arent good because saitama one hits it theyre good because of all the other heroes and monsters who do people remember the most in the sea king fight not saitama they think of genos sacrificing himself or licenseless riders badassery of course there will still be jokes about saitama being super strong but the season finale takes that away by introducing a stronger than usual foe but in the end one punch is not about saitama its about the world and people and monsters surrounding him
anime,removed,so arc will start on ep i am so hyped for this its insane man
anime,removed,they have any right to do so as the next arc is skyrocketing the show in pretty much everything that makes it so good right now throughout these episodes i always had the feeling they somehow held a bit back especially on the soundtrack department knowing what awaits us further down the line it makes sense though
anime,removed,definitely the height of the series overall probably long text so no tags spoilers ahead pain was the best villain in naruto the first major antagonist who gave you the feeling of despair because nobody seemed to be able to defeat him kakashi carrying him on his back and then that scene when they come back to the village i must admit while the anime never was the greatest thing on the planet that scene makes me tearyeyed every time i see it considering all the pain he went through

anime,removed,stroke my massive invisible s beard
anime,removed,discussion what do you guys think of the endingi know it was dope do you guys think lelouch vi brittania is alive or dead
anime,removed,you guys have it all wrong this is going to be a slice of life anime at an orange farm
anime,removed,clannad cause i wanted kyou to be chosen by tomoya instead it was nagisa who was probably the worst choice for me
anime,removed,subaru apparently chose rem as a second wife but the anime skipped that because stuff related to that wouldve made the ending bad unless was certain
anime,removed,clannad is good its × episodes and they even marry
anime,removed,yep but the reverse with nana im still sad she didnt end up with nobu
anime,removed,so you mean to tell me he wasnt killed when he died youre either dead or youre not lelouch got stabbed and should have died but following hints etc we can come to the conclusion that he was immortal they can resurrect him in a lot of ways also its schrödingers lelouch at this point hes dead and alive until we watch
anime,removed,it was pretty obvious lelouch didnt die at the end though it wont ruin anything for me because i knew he was alive
anime,removed,boku no pico
anime,removed,why would you want to use that retarded sound
anime,removed,lelouch never died
anime,removed,that doesnt look like madoka cast aside your false profits and join us in the cycle oh depraved one
anime,removed,this comment was reported as containing untagged spoilers so ive removed it please edit in a tag and reply to me so i can reapprove it
anime,removed,boku no pico jk spice and wolf
anime,removed,ha i never said i wood i was unaware of that one sorry
anime,removed,it could be but i doubt it i dont see why japanese viewers would torrent an english subbed anime instead of simply watching it when its broadcasted or finding a raw plus commies website is in english which would make it confusing to navigate through their website for a nonenglish speaker
anime,removed,ohhhh maybe it was a mistranslation but doesnt killua refer to her as sister though
anime,removed,mah boi trump will have to wait until next year
anime,removed,i would love a adaptation with a proper ending its one of the rare shounens i actually like
anime,removed,so i havent finished naruto yet took a break for a while do you recommend any site in particular to watch shippuden fansubbed
anime,removed,reddit sucks
anime,removed,thank you for respecting my opinion but rfairytail needs to get a life and accept opinions
anime,removed,its still fairy tail try harder villager
anime,removed,plays roblox your argument is invalid say aye to happy
anime,removed,it is a play on marths name math is for people who have nothing better to do and would rather bore themselves with combining numbers
anime,removed,try fansub reviews from people like cry more or check fansubco or mal reviews bakabt torrent comments in some cases
anime,removed,seems that up to a few years ago most series got the trifecta on the op kanji transliteration romaji transcription english translation nice for practice now i dont see any translation of the op song at least on stream sites hmm though my gargantiautw does have romajienglish but thats still a anime its a minor thing but i do like a lot of groups coloring text by character hair though just making the text readable at all can be an improvement over official httpsfansubco is really useful for comparing groups interesting
anime,removed,i remember when animekingdom came out of nowhere during episode of gundam seed and btfo of aj and shinsekifansubs because they were a quality translation that actually got the torrents out within hours of the episode airing started a sort of fansub war between ak and aj over who could get the gundam eps out first then the show got licensed at episode and cries of rage were heard all across animesuki lmao i powered my way through episodes of seed by watching raws
anime,removed,i found it boring it stole a whole bunch of ideas from older mecha anime and barley did anything with them sol scenes were boring pacing was terrible and the ending was horribly rushed main cast and villains were also boring and generic
anime,removed,its gin vs takasugi duh
anime,removed,this game has better atmosphere though
anime,removed,wait really i thought it was pretty much captivating though i wish someone stayed dead in the ending
anime,removed,just wanna point out that digibro cant participate on this thread because hes banned
anime,removed,surprised no one has mentioned episode of claymore the fight feels and overall badassness of teresa really made her one of the best characters in the show it also tells so much story and cements how teresa was the only one that would have been able to kill priscilla making priscilla seem so much more frightening
anime,removed,i didnt particularly like the gap between my personal favourite from the show and this one felt uncomfortable and relied on a slightly toowordy deus ex machina that screamed plothole to bring okabe back to his senses
anime,removed,the message he received filled him with far too much hope and seemed awfully convenient time travel often allows for simple fixes like this one but arent without becoming plot holes steinsgate mostly avoided this up until the finale maybe im just a bit too ready for steinsgate
anime,removed,theres quite a lot of sidematerial to yuyuyu though ive only read the translated novella me dont really get on and its adorable ive heard the prequel novel is very good though might be a little similar to the original series though with younger girls and a little less optimism in the end hence it being a prequel as for series theres a lot of fantheories going around and they do sound quite awesome i cant wait to get back to mimori being awesome even if she wont be in a wheelchair anymore though im also concerned for the shows overall quality especially since unless im mistaken it will only be episodes
anime,removed,rezero is the confession episode right or is it the brutal beatdown and the confession cant remember
anime,removed,funny thing is that those people who think anime plots are hard to understand probably are the same people that cant enjoy an anime by turning off their brain and seeing the spectacle that it creates look at mayoiga for example that shit show was so bad and yet people fucking interpreted it as being intentionally bad like seriously get real and then they have the cheek to call hyped anime overhyped ect they hate shows that are popular and enjoy shows that are satirical toward those overhyped shows themes this happens in all communities its more sociological than just anime related anyways i havent seen rakugo but by the sounds of it it shouldnt entertain me because i like anime where the main character just curb stomps everyone berserk one punch man mob the glorious toriko but all in all most of the people in this community are just sheeps following the herd trying to get updoots on their hipster comments its cute jojo best anime of the year if you dont like the duwang then dont even watch anime anymore you plebian
anime,removed,kira yoshikage is pretty much attempting to live a normal life well and kill women occasionally
anime,removed,httpiimgurcomsynulcplpng

anime,removed,yeah those are also unnecessary i wish the mods would delete them all
anime,removed,for the record i actually upvoted lol
anime,removed,i guess the answer is no
anime,removed,i downvoted because the video had fairly low substance as far as i know this sub doesnt care anymore for this show and there are blog posts and videos out there with better content this video just got shared because its by digi and for no other reason
anime,removed,no most digibro threads start with im surprised he didnt do a episode series on it hehe returning to seriousness i think it has to do with his style i think and that his opinions of certain shows and how he expresses them upsets people as well as his opinion of most anime where some people perceive insult
anime,removed,similar to the argument that shinobu is actually years old
anime,removed,probably but also probably not
anime,removed,
anime,removed,no good reason really i mean sure the princess was safe with them but as far as he was concerned s the earthlings were still his enemies it didnt help that inaho fucking shot him out the of the sky the first time they met because neither was willing to trust the other

anime,removed,i dont know i dont know why would i dislike a character with jelly bananas instead of brain she was there just to be stupid and make hououin suffer and suffer and suffer through multiple loops
anime,removed,what happened here
anime,removed,spookyglasses you want spoilers s she is literally assigned a role by everyone and nobody understands her including herself for herself rose bride utena princess miki idol kozue competition touga tool saionji possession nanami mirror of herself reminding her of her incestous love juri a symbol of miracle nobody cares to accept her for who she is until utena revolutionizes her world
anime,removed,the happiest person has a dark past trigun
anime,removed,tomoda he gave his youth for us s squealer
anime,removed,the betrayal i felt watching rebellion for the first time never doubt the uributcherer i would like to experience that again
anime,removed,he wont ban me disagreeing with the mods isnt against the rules banning me for this would absolutely destroy his reputation plus as much as he lets his personal opinions influence his work on the watch order wiki he wouldnt ban a user because her personally dislikes them
anime,removed,hes not saying the watch order is confusing hes saying index the show is confusing
anime,removed,im with you on that one a lot of people i talk to have had or are having problem with how biased urban is but i probably dont have much authority as im only a sad sad lurker
anime,removed,mello and near ruined death note for me i feel like i could have accepted light going full crazy corrupt but to just asspull these new super smart detectives was too much for me
anime,removed,why did you have word that sentence that way it brings back sad memories
anime,removed,shows how much attention you paid to the movies she never killed anybody and she didnt go killing because of her eyes it was a habit of shiki who was her destruction impulse so after losing him she tried to compensate by acting like him so she did those late night walks i dont see why you think she killed anybody mikiya didnt believe in her because he loved but because he knew she would never kill anybody since she knows the pain of constantly suppressing and killing shiki what do you expect from psychopaths of course they have to show them in a negative light smirking and laughing so that we know they are evil also they are psychopaths its only natural
anime,removed,also irisviel is

anime,removed,she cant didnt you get the memo
anime,removed,the annoying part is that when i look for ddl sites google keeps trying to give me streaming sites or torrent sites
anime,removed,dont exactly know how this works but ill try it sue for damages potential spoilers id like to sue mayoiga for potentially being the worst anime this season imo mayoiga fans send me execution threats the start was mysterious and interesting and ngl somewhere in the middle i was pretty hooked on the story too but by the time we hit or the pacing of the show went out the window and all hell broke loose and not in the good way either was where the plot jumped off a cliff and threw the anime into a mess and well the finale the finale was just horrible the dialogues were obviously sped up in that last ep animation was rushed story was wrapped up in the easiest way possible that so many plotholes were left behind ill try my best to avoid spoilers but think back to every big complication or conflict that occurred throughout the anime then think about how they tried to tie it all up in the last ep barely any of it makes sense lastly id like to actually sue mayoiga for actual damages because i stayed up for that extra minutes or so to watch the finale
anime,removed,louise tldr start the episode getting mad at saito and using explosion spend the whole episode thinking that maybe she exaggerated a bit with how she acted to saito at the start of the time the last thing she will say will be around the lines of no that dog deserved it not to mention that she literally treats him like a dog for a long part of the series like wtf mate get her ass saved by saito think that she definitively exaggerated at the start and she either says sorry or gives him something in exchange her whole minute of dere part of her tsundere care of the time she will use explosion again after another missunderstanding happens siesta the maid was meh tiffania was clear best girl
anime,removed,did the boobs that come off look anything like

anime,removed,clannad last death didnt expect that at all
anime,removed,so you have an obnoxious guy who is magically teleported into a fantasy world and hes not even interested in why or how he got there subaru feels like the brain child of a bunch of dudes with no experience in talking to girls at all oh ill just give everyone nicknames and praise them nonstop theyll definitely fall for me he literally commits suicide to save a girl who murdered him twice
anime,removed,ah i shouldve added she refuses to grow up and suffers from arrested development because of said spoilers
anime,removed,the thing is i never found him to be that incompetent that meme about him not getting in the robot just doesnt happen until he got a trauma watching the eva he was supposed to be piloting absolutely destroy his friend the rest of the time he gets in the robot and does the job a bit messily but he does it i rooted for him all the way and he had his awkward moments for example with rei but i never really thought he was incompetent its just that he wasnt gifted or that special but on the contrary that makes him stand out in my eyes
anime,removed,its hard to empathize and take the love plot seriously when theyre not even in high school yet middle schoolers dont think or talk so eloquently i thought they dragged out kaoris death way too long and beat its foreshadowing into the viewer like a dead horse for a main heroine kaori was too shallowunderdeveloped imo very poor comedic timing and it was supposed to be funny that kousei a depressed kid who suffered from parental abuse is being physically abused by his own friends
anime,removed,the only thing i liked was suzakus reaction during euphemias death which seemed real enough and then lelouchs reaction when the bomb thing went off and thought nunally was lost
anime,removed,nothing
anime,removed,is there a way you can contact other mods
anime,removed,unless it had a zombie tag in which case it would have been spoiled
anime,removed,alright so sakura and sasuke get together but then sasuke dies by naruto and naruto also gets with hinata and jiraiya also dies in shippuden and fourth ninja war occurs with obito uchiha and madara uchiha as the enemies and neji in the fight i hope i didnt spoil anything hope you enjoy

anime,removed,grisaia no kajitsu
anime,removed,what this guy said i like how one of the most philosophicallydense episodes was handled in a very upbeat tone by having the tachikomas discuss it where otherwise the hardass niggahs of the show in this case major and batou would have a very dark grim or otherwise pessimistic approach
anime,removed,theyre a new studio but those involved have been in the business for years i do doubt the company was in such a bad financial decision they would risk it all on a new show also where that source mr

anime,removed,when i was younger aroound or so i watched with my parents quite a dew anime made it onto this list for some reason made it onto the list for those of you not in the know its a pornographic ova series dealing with tentacle rape and extreme gore i remember one of the clips they showed was about a giant demonic penis bursting up through the ground demolishing a building and absorbing everyone inside it into it ontop of how awkward this was it was only made worse as the hosts of the show tried to talk about what they just witnessed it was obvious that the idea of tentacle porn or even animated erotica in general was new to many of them
anime,removed,furher bradley when he calmly tears apart the faith of the ishvalans is one of the more cocky rants of anine sugou from sao the dude thinks hes a god and brags about his rapey plans and his victims helplessness ghost kayaba made sure he got what he had coming
anime,removed,the chapter with the little girls and that dog is probably one of the most fucked up things ive seen
anime,removed,i couldnt stand bakumans mashiro wasnt exactly in love with takagi either but he was a lot less annoying he was incredibly shortsighted and selfinvolved which i wouldnt mind except he never really gets punished for it in fact the show seems to reward his stupid behaviour he proposes to a girl hes had all of one conversation with and then goes along with her utterly idiotic suggestion that they never actually talk to each other or go on any real dates for the forseeable future and the show constantly has characters talking about how head over heels in love they are and how theyre a great couple when they literally know nothing about each other he works himself to exhaustion then completely ignores the totally reasonable and sensible demands of his editors to take a break because its damaging his health and not only am i not supposed to see him as a moron im supposed to cheer for him when he recklessly endangers his health and the quality of his work despite being in a goddamn hospital bed he tries to sabotage someone elses attempts to end their own manga on their own terms because of his own selfish need to outdo them in the rankings then pitches a fit some time later when he wants to end his manga on his own terms and people dont want to let him he never gets called out on the hypocrisy of his behaviour here honestly one of the most frustrating protagonists in any show ive ever watched

anime,removed,everytime there was some revelation i was like dude you seriously didnt realize it during the weeks when you were switching your bodies
anime,removed,wtf i just read the manga plot on the wiki this is nothing like the movie at all
anime,removed,
anime,removed,so does rutracker
anime,removed,but villain and antagonist arent necessarily the same things i usually understand antagonist as someone who opposes our heros ideals and usually serves as his main opposition seto kaiba in yugioh was an antagonist but he wasnt usually the main villain
anime,removed,not if the fact that it was a dream is there from the very beginning there is a difference between putting a plot point in the story from the start mentioning it multiple times and having a story and then saying oh yeah it was a dream at the last second
anime,removed,finally got around to checking it out good flick and all that but didnt seem all that original it was pretty much httpsuploadwikimediaorgwikipediaenbbcposterlakehousejpg with some body swapping tossed in not that its a bad thing i really liked the premise and usage but dont understand why its blown up so big glad to see anime getting recognition and good press though
anime,removed,nyaa
anime,removed,the film does not feature a diverse multicultural cast so im sure it wont win an oscar
anime,removed,more like the same mindset you described from a different perspective

anime,removed,one thing i never understood at the beginning mitsuha wakes up remarking about how it seems so realistic and touches her boobs as if it were actually taki yet on her way to school her friends remark about how she was not herself the day before so obviously that first day mitsuha is herself yet when she wakes up shes feeling herself and surprised that shes a girl

anime,removed,it still is cheap though scar doesnt die even though he brutally murdered a bunch of state alchemists he can just chill with his buddies thats retarded also roy shouldve stayed blind that was also stupid literally last second he just gets his eyesight back people cant handle criticism because muh favorite animu
anime,removed,from funimations description of the movie when a dazzling comet lights up the nights sky it dawns on them they want something more from this connection—a chance to meet an opportunity to truly know each other tugging at the string of fate they try to find a way to each other but distance isnt the only thing keeping them apart is their bond strong enough to face the cruel irony of time or is their meeting nothing more than a wish upon the stars why do they always have to basically spoil the plot twist in the fucking description its not gonna ruin the movie but it takes a great deal of the surprise away and makes it less impactful when its finally revealed in the movie i hate it when companies do this
anime,removed,theres no such a thing as moe theme or moe plot like how can you even describe what moe plot is moe used in slang refers to feelings of affection adoration devotion and excitement that embodies characters that appear in manga anime or video games into enforcing who they are moe according to wikipedia and urban dictionaries is used to describe sexual cute etc traits of a specific character i dont think theme can be found cute or make you want to protect it or anything moreover theres no moe genre moe theme or other moe things not related to characters in anime as shown by the words definition moreover i never said that plot and theme of lain are moe i said that lain as anime is moe it pictures cute girl doing autistic things in unknown to her world that would classify it as moe as long as you find cgdct moe and different themes than most cgdct doesnt change the nature of what it is

anime,removed,you mean boros old team from when he was a regular yeah i forget their names a lot too but i still loved their backstory it doesnt really have anything to do with the main plot but it tells the story so beautifully sure you might not care about them but the part where roen the orange haired girl dies i got teary eyed also itd have been much better if daniel had died at the end instead of joining baam but oh well so yeah i think the story it told was more important than caring about the characters individually lol the only names that i remember perfectly are baams first team the rankers and the villains
anime,removed,i just want dororo at least that i not lost dororo is something that does exist as a dvd release which has been around since the the problem was that it was limited batch and only the first episodes have been drifting about the internet the pilot is also on this dvd subbed this is a problem that a lot of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiworldmasterpiecetheater have this is how shigofumi watched it he rented it from his bloody local library however recently there has been a new production of the dvds however its incredibly expensive however this is why private trackers exist and one i know about voted a few months ago on what to pool there money on and the dororo dvd won and when this download becomes available no that private tracker its only a matter of time because it becomes released on bakabt or nyaa this occurred about months ago so it should be about now when it appears even some subs im not sure what this means is your copy of the pilot subbed or not if its not an issue for your to set up a source id love a copy thank you
anime,removed,any film recommendations ive generally not seen many but after your name i feel like watching more ive seen end of and rebuild eva your name patema inverted the kara no kyoukai films redline per second and summer wars enjoyed all of them wasnt a huge fan of summer wars it just never grabbed me somehow and i need to rewatch kara because its still a bit all over the place on my head im super excited for koe no katachi when its in cinemas shortly

anime,removed,yes i was beating around the bush since you know mods i was saying piracy is an alternative to cr modspleasedontban
anime,removed,he gets better in the manga and never seems to advance hes really fucking funny
anime,removed,suffaru can relate
anime,removed,im glad this time theres no backlash when shin sekai yori got gay the threads were really awful about it
anime,removed,every once in a while im ok with japans censor board deciding i dont need to see something this is one of those times im not the most squeamish person but i dont like damage to eyes and i really dont like damage to fingernails s im going to have one more very uncomfortable moment later in this part i know
anime,removed,so basically touma from index
anime,removed,gilles de rais also referred to by the name blue beard is who caster from fatezero was based on
anime,removed,greed was more interesting as ling yaos alter ego than as a standalone character so that i guess
anime,removed,then what is the right answer according to you because last i checked comments didnt need to be approved by some selfrighteous faggot on the internet
anime,removed,wait what i watched episodes of these so far but the link in your post has entirely different characters
anime,removed,drifter and ends are two different terms describing people who arrive from other worlds you will find out why later but no jesus is king of the ends as stated in this ep
anime,removed,its a lot faster than in working for sure but i dont think thats necessarily a bad thing one of my personal gripes with working s the second season specifically was that it really dragged its feet in terms of relationship development that is until s the third season where everything really took off in any case much of the romantic progression here has been more along the lines of pseudodevelopment so weve yet to have a good idea about how far the show will go
anime,removed,a school based shounen that asspulls the end tail of the plot for a happy ending
anime,removed,well perhaps after the act she lose all her powers like maria the witch and the child receive all her powers if its female
anime,removed,for gilgamesh yeah he never wins

anime,removed,in a way i kind of wish the anime didnt reveal that so early the light novels reveal that waaay later on near the end it was supposed to put her actions into perspective once you realized her age
anime,removed,s good villains pose a threat and serve a greater purpose than just being the final boss with gilgamesh i wasnt eager to see him lose so much as i just wanted it to all be over with its not like the other servants pose much of a threat either but at least they were entertaining in their evil machinations
anime,removed,fmab had a bad ending because it went against its themes by having a happy ending rebuild of eva especially is disgrace to the evangelion franchise hunter x is average at best due to its inconsistency higurashi is better than steinsgate and erased ash is better than red as character for a kids show
anime,removed,i guess girls dying isnt as bad as all of them eventually becoming witches perspective
anime,removed,i dont watch anime for the purposes of sexual desire so unless its done in a particularly suave realistic or funny way d rather not have it and when i say funny i mean in a well written way not the typical fairy tail kind of way at the end of the day if i wanted to fulfill my sexual desires id httpswwwpornmdcom or go to a
anime,removed,psst
anime,removed,idk linggreed is pretty dope
anime,removed,worse that was the best part of the episode i was pissed the whole time and boom catharsis
anime,removed,lovehate all villians envy was a nice evil character not bland evil but interesting and funny though envy and lust getting their punishment was sweet never forget hughes
anime,removed,not really the promotional materials when the show came out made it really clear the characters would grow up
anime,removed,hes not insulting you i didnt say he was insulting me lowest common denominator when applied to fiction the term lowest common denominator means appealing to as many people at once as possible so basically he is prejudiced against certain shows and people who watch them he does not know them and doesnt know what they are like he pulled it out of his ass lets be honest sadly the cult of his followers just adapt his thinking and agree without trying to understand what he is saying at all it makes no sense and what does it have to do with autism do you know what autism is does he know because it really doesnt seem so at all its offensive to two groups of people the people that are enthusiastic or obsessive about things they like and collect all kinds items that are part of a certain franchise or a character they like and can afford to and its insulting to people who do suffer from being autistic which in no way turn them into neets that buy otaku stuff
anime,removed,s oppai route
anime,removed,one day i was browsing local torrent tracker that i used at the time encountered melancholy of haruhi suzumiya and decided to watch it at that point i was curious about what anime was but not to the point id look for it deliberately so i watched haruhi liked it and started downloading other popular stuff at the time like death note i watched a lot of titles in a short time dont remember which ones in particular since many of them were mediocre that was in and i was at the time
anime,removed,well for someone who likes to fastforward barusu scenes because hes annoying but hes important to the plot ughh ill give my personal opinions why he is intolerable s he keeps running his mouth and does stuff without thinking twice which is annoying like the time he made a scene in the selection im glad he got his ass beat his obsession with emilia is really annoying as well he can be labelled as a stalker since emilia told him to stay put and what the f did he do he followed her still
anime,removed,torrents man
anime,removed,yeah s basically the mc went slightly crazy cause shit wasnt turning out like a vn for him and started going a bit white knight on the show which i guess either people didnt like because they were looking for something more light hearted or it just hit to close to home for them
anime,removed,he appeared as a clown in the first season
anime,removed,sounds good to me i dont know if i could take an anime killing someone off again any time soon after kaori
anime,removed,wait people didnt realize who was the killer early on i thought it was pretty predictable and they even dropped alot of hints
anime,removed,theres two kinds of gl fans the ones who think the second half starts after the time skip and the ones who think it starts after that one thing
anime,removed,i was actually being sarcastic but getting both of you to believe me is good too
anime,removed,who the female titan was in snk it was just a mild suspicion but im still proud s
anime,removed,it felt like it was really obvious he was the only one in the cast who it could pretty much be
anime,removed,this so much this sounded literally like a wannabe literature prof jerking off to his own amazing skills of analyzing things and i felt so so ashamed for him when i found out that this guy had literally written down nothing of value in this almostwalloftext
anime,removed,holy shit i didnt realize that kenya fits within the assasins profile and it would have been a better plot twist if he was the killer
anime,removed,did i see the main character for tales of berseria in the opening im pretty sure i did
anime,removed,i guess well see lailah at episode and edna at episode at this pace
anime,removed,no guts is the main character of berserk therefore he is the protagonist again from wikipedia a protagonist from ancient greek πρωταγωνιστής protagonistes meaning player of the first part chief actor is the main character in any story such as a literary work or drama guts is actually a good example because of how morally ambiguous his character can be at times since the story is told from his perspective he is the protagonist even he when he does bad things like killing adonis
anime,removed,i might end up liking this adaptation more than the manga though it wont be able to fix the issue of naho and kakeru being the blandest characters of the whole group
anime,removed,all aboard the feels train next week well be arriving at feelsadelphia so buckle up kids
anime,removed,or any scene with izaya in it really excluding that time he got stabbed to almost death
anime,removed,behind the freezing door is puck its his true form qn i duno
anime,removed,was quite mild if you compare it to the ln lol xd was nice seeing puck so mad at the end always wanted to see that form of his
anime,removed,i cant help but wonder if we are getting close to the parts that made japanese fans drop the series due to their inability to watch subaru suffer if not it would be interesting to see how much worse things can really get
anime,removed,it is
anime,removed,big mom has already appeared in op anime s yes about episodes ago back in fishman island boa hancock s she started as an antagonist remember when luffy fell in her bath and then made him fight that giant cat and then fight her sisters
anime,removed,ahahahahahaha then i will let you hope without spoiling
anime,removed,im a manga reader but i totally forgot why didnt nahos future self write about how kakerus mom committed suicide the day he got invited to hang out the wording was something like i seriously dont want you to invite him and that definitely doesnt convey exactly how bad the consequences were going to be maybe the time travel mechanics require her not to write any specifics
anime,removed,oh so that means s reset if emilia dies thats kinda nice
anime,removed,yep its puck he killed subaru both times its implied emilia died thats why he said sleep along with my daughter and he went on a rampage its not known however if he knowns about subarus resetting
anime,removed,anime trackr has some flaws but is great nonetheless
anime,removed,holy fucking shittttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
anime,removed,did someone say httpiimgurcomjfusakojpg
anime,removed,this happens at the final episode when subaru dies and then somehow loses his ability to reset and the whole show restarts without him dying ever again trust me
anime,removed,statistically everyone he knows like less than people who want to help him but most of the time hes fighting alone not their fault seeing how hes a monster in human flesh and only someone as monstrous as himself can fight the demons
anime,removed,i mean this serves as escapism really well for me all of those things that happen arent something that usually happens in everyday life for a vast majority of us
anime,removed,fckin doge was behind this
anime,removed,nsfw really glad it did not
anime,removed,episode then comes the episode
anime,removed,the amount of people enjoying best car getting rekt when he says stupid things because he is ptsd as hell from dying so many times greatly disturbs me i can agree on that subaru not being perfect and all of those deaths affecting him like that is what makes him a great character imo instead of a generic selfinsert wish fullfillment character i sure as hell wouldnt want to trade with him right now its like people who enjoy gore movies i can never understand how you can enjoy another human beings suffering its just a basic lack of empathy i think thats a bit too harsh though movies arent real i dont think someone lacks empathy if they enjoy gore movies
anime,removed,her route seems like it would be really really fun the ova for clannad is an alternate universe where tomoya and tomoyo are in a relationship and i think its the single best episode out of the whole season its spoiler free so you could probably watch it now
anime,removed,he is the witch of envy the autor made the whole story to reference snow white
anime,removed,im with you on that one re zero is an entertaining show but too much of its cast feel underdeveloped they dont feel real to me plus we know next to nothing about subaru in the real world so all he is to me is an idiot who was thrown into a random world for no reason and forced to go through painful events theres the shock factor but theres no oomph behind it im here for the story and to see how the characters develop not to watch a guy get mindraped not that there is anything wrong with that but i feel like the shows not reaching its full potential
anime,removed,blasphemy berserk was way more intense this is just child play yeah its tragic but means almost nothing as all is errased the next day anyways eclipse was alot more grey area rather than black and white like this tere is not dispair in this just painful to watch but there is sure hope in the restart ability
anime,removed,its just a basic lack of empathy actually its the exact opposite you watch to feel and my god the suffering is incredible a psychopath that genuinely lacks empathy would probably be bored by this anime
anime,removed,am i the only one disturbed by the ntrlike vibes technically its not ntr but this show so far gives the impression of that kakeru and naho will be in love and a couple then for some reason skips to the future where presumably kakeru is dead and naho got together with suwa instead which really triggers me for reference boku dake ga inai machi and nana spoilers this happens in these shows too in the end of boku dake ga inai machi you would assume that mc would get together with the main girl but doesnt end up that way that was fucked up and this anime is giving same vibes
anime,removed,light novel
anime,removed,real life isnt about netorare dude in nana she went around having sex with a douchebag for absolutely no reason and kept ditching the guy she said she liked that was so painful to watch i absolutely hate the nana anime i cant withstand cuckold at all a dumb girl going around choosing a douchebag making her cry over the nice genuine guy who actually likes her but it taught me something valuable about life that you should be a douchebag as a male thats the best you can be if youre a douche you can get pretty much any girl even if they like your or not and you dont even have to like them back thats what nana taught us and i didnt say the show wasnt about stopping kakeru from dying but the show is implying that kakeru and naho are going to get together which is what makes it bad if shes going to save him it should be all about that why include a love tragedy where one of them will get hurt
anime,removed,minor spoiler because i wont tell you anything did you know that subaru already spoke to a person from regular boring earth before this episode beetlejuice might also be from earth but thats just speculation and im not talking about him
anime,removed,by my command seal i order you lancer commit sudoku oops i did that wrong commit seppeku there we go

anime,removed,i forgot about her iron swords they just didnt appear enough for me to remember them immediately
anime,removed,humanity was supposed to go extinct in given the way the rest of the year went thats not really surprising was lancer medusa wielding herpe thats uh not a good sign so cu chulainn is a caster now why has everyone suddenly swapped classes i kinda feel bad for olga when she was yelling about no ones ever praised me for anything i realised that shes pretty much the only character with clearly stated goals and she just dies without really doing anything does her character really have a point same with fou why does fou exist besides being an obligatory cute mascot character anyway ritsuka is bland and boring mash is cute animation was pretty good except for that awful cg wickerman and the story seems like it could go some really cool places probably worth a watch if youre a hopeless typemoon fanboy like me
anime,removed,s its not true time travel but more of a meme i guess so in episode of ss or whatever episode that they visited otonokizaka they walked up the stairs to the school and they saw some tiny girl who looked like a small honoka jump around and slide down some stairs virtually what honoka did in the first episode of ll its just a running joke about honk time travelling again

anime,removed,haha my mistake thanks bot

anime,removed,hey all its been a month or so since ive posted here and man time sure flies by ill keep this short there are two topics i want to cover me being in the dog house me and akeno well more like me pissing her off and i know it was my fault in the end too dont worry we made up but more on that later the other is a decade or more from reading bleach and only being salty about the god damn ending reternith rmeganerd without delay ill keep it brief and i do want to note that im trying my damnest to keep this as updated as possible and its actually almost a year here since this entire real life romcom started here anyway it started the other day straight after work it was late but i actually had wedding stuff to attend to and i asked akeno if she wanted to come with me she said no and told me she was tired and wanted to head home first me being wrong i pleaded and told her i wanted to introduce her to my friends and she said yes here was my mistake i told her that it would only take an hour or less but it didnt by the time we left most restaurants have already closed so i was in the dog house for the next day or so dont worry we made up she ended up calling her parents about the entire ordeal and her mom told her to remember that i dont really get to see my friends that much and to be more understanding and what not coming from an asian family the parents would always be on the daughters side and never the dude anyways i ended up getting her flowers and she made dinner that night now onto the next bit i have followed bleach since i was in high school and through my nursing studies i fucking love bleach and the entire series and what it was about even during the decline of the series i still defended no matter what then the ending came and it was just a curveball im on the grand ichiruki yacht but i respect all ships okay seeing the other during the ending of the manga made me extremely salty to the point where akeno was questioning why i was so upset over these characters then there is the actual ending that just shit its literally shit so many damn questions unanswered and plotholes left unfilled im left as a fan of the series with a broken heart and uncertainty i love you kubo and i dont know what shounen did to you to make you rush but i hope to one day it gets resolved or some of the stuff gets answered for now least we have lots of bleach fanfiction that have way better ending than what we were given still my hats off to you kubosan otsukaresamadesu you deserve it you amazing man and lastly thank you all that read my post here whenever i do post im busy all the time but i am frequently on this sub reading through the threads yall are like family to me man even though profession keeps me busy i somehow make time to update you guys with whatever that is going on in my real life romcom i love you all see you next time

anime,removed,fraaaaaaak last night i was thinking about it and it came out perfectly in my head episodes for shiratorizawa match episodes for tokyo finals from training camps to karasuno driving to nationals including date tech games the only thing i though it might not make this doable would be the time after the training camps and nationals there is going to be a bunch matches for karausno where they wouldnt be able to fit all the training matches on a episodes season it would kind of neat thou that something along the lines of slam dunk would happen where karasuno has a match against oikawa setter ushiwaka spiker mad dog mb iwaizumi spiker aone mb takeru spiker now i am depressed i need a beer still looking forward to this merely episode season
anime,removed,but dinosaurs
anime,removed,let me just say nyaa
anime,removed,yeah it seems like they fixed it now but im still annoyed by it even more so that i got downvoted to hell for it look it just that i got mad that funimation fucked up with uploading an episode because im paying for their service so i find this kind of shit unacceptable its understandable for less official or legal service but i expect better from the official thing it makes it hard to support the official release if shit like that happens can you understand me
anime,removed,kill la kill gurrenn lagann was shit after a certain someone died

anime,removed,this guy screw all those morally grey villans cuz villans should be pitch black httpiimgurcomnrldahwjpg
anime,removed,the only reason griffith ever got tortured or even went to impulsively have sex with that princess girl was because he was disoriented after guts left behind everything that theyd have worked for griffith was a great man explaining his behavior as just lust or being a man isnt enough he could have fulfilled his sexual desires with just about any girl willingly but he knew his actions would have consequences anyway i really like to pretend anything past the point where guts went full retard isnt canon because the show literally went form reall quick ofcourse i wont be stupid and say that its bad i can see why people like it but the griffith i liked was from the first episodes
anime,removed,yeah i was definitely sad code geass is one of the two anime i ever cried on but when you think about it afterward you should be happy about what he has done its sad that he sacrificed himself for the world without anyone knowing his attention but i think its happy that he had done it and know the world is a better place with peace
anime,removed,keep in mind this is just my opinion but i think char is the greatest villain to grace anime and one of the greatest villains altogether he starts as a rival to the main character miles ahead in terms of combat skill but we eventually learn of his grudge against the main antagonists of and his quest for revenge after the timeskip into zeta we see him trying to avoid who he is both the responsibility and the shame he feels from his actions this causes his character to fall into piecesvery similar to the haise sasakiken kaneki split from tokyo ghoul and he goes into hiding struggling to pick up the pieces of who he is he decides the best course of action is to punish humanity for their wrongdoings and attempts to destroy earth so he can in a way lead humanity into a new better world from the remains of the old world what i find so great about him is that hes a villain that is absolute we want him to be stopped but we understand why he is justifying what he was doing and he doesnt waver hes not evil to be evil but hes also not weak enough to be swayed by the strength of will presented against him he fought his rival amuro ray to the bitter end and it concludes the character so perfectly
anime,removed,am i actually the only one that genuinely thought it was awesome they made arthur into a woman and then being presented her personality started to loath her she seemed so insecure her views and values started crumbling at the slightest confrontation also she had drowned in self pity from the looks of it she was depicted like a generic anime harem girl and that really upset me especially because i always pictured arthur a badass king with extremely great willpower and values i have never read this anywhere so im actually curious if im the only one thinking this

anime,removed,spoilers thats a toughyof course angel beats ending rips my heart out every single time i watch it also the scene in fate zero when lancer is killedomg that sucked it killed me he was my favorite character but honestly i watch a lot of horror anime with lots of sad scenes in it so picking one is tough
anime,removed,that ending to the chimera arc just left me in tears never knew i could sympathize with a mass murderer tt
anime,removed,i could probably take megumin but only if she already cast her daily explosion
anime,removed,asdf
anime,removed,around in we see a light orb i like how it was shown twice while the sister was speaking to show how important they are s remember that whenever tomoya helps someone a light orb appears and then in the end all the light orbs were collected to make a wish and he chose it to revive nagisa i just love the friendship between nagisa and tomoya he constantly says i have nothing else to do but i think he really enjoys her company and that she has made his life more interesting the parents are so nice taking a girl they dont know because nagisa asked them too it shows how much they trust their daughter and her judgement they are one of the best parents of anime ever akio is the best father of any anime and no one can convince me everyone thinks that nagisas mother is actually her sister since tomoya didnt deny it and nagisa was too busy smiling at fuko s i cant wait for the episode where sunohara has a date with her if fuko really is a ghost then she must have been very lonely for a long time if she hadnt met tomoya then she wouldnt had met nagisa and the others sure the others dont care as much for fuko as nagisa and tomoya but in the final scene you see that they all consider fuko their friends and her smile was so adorable another light orb appears at an old man is shown at the end and i think hell appear next episode or very soon a light orb is shown once again at and it looks like only tomoya saw it i checked and it looks like fukos arc will end around episode the next arc is my favorite so i cant wait
anime,removed,i heard euphoria is interesting

anime,removed,put simon in prison for saving a city the only way he could forcing people above ground and no keeping that census of humans on the surface was not a good reason
anime,removed,forced relocation of people that arent even his citizens aside theres no justification for putting simon in prison the destruction of that city was going to happen without simons intervention and what damage did transpire was miniscule in comparison to lives that would have been lost
anime,removed,light yagami wait

anime,removed,the worst thing is that the last one survived probably as a vegetable after all that stress though
anime,removed,he was a nice guy it was madara who made him bad
anime,removed,maybe rezero basically the main character is transported to a fantasy world and meets a bunch of people that he cares for but they get murdered and he discovers that upon death he respawntravels back in time the second arc is a pretty good mystery after episode
anime,removed,i hated him and constantly wondered why he still had a job to turn up to but hes kind of an important addition so much of the series is about various characters following their dreams and trying to figure out how to reconcile those dreams with reality and for the most part it pays off for them and then theres hiraoka who followed his and got shat on until it broke him he was a vital counterbalance
anime,removed,clears throat there was one frame from tokyo ghoul of a keyboard it looks amazing

anime,removed,s whos rem
anime,removed,school days pretty much everyone said its about a guy who fucks every girl and then gets killed by one of them kinda sucks it was spoiled would be a hell of a twist also madoka magica for a similar reason anything that takes a twist from the typical gets popular because of that twist so you will always know the main surprise factor of the anime before you watch it
anime,removed,and they will see katsura is not one to be fucked with when hes serious
anime,removed,just check in the discussion threads for the most downvoted comments id link you to them but im not allowed

anime,removed,omg hahaha xdddd
anime,removed,police will stop them reigen called the police on them and the police have their own espers that destroyed the main hq
anime,removed,b gata h kei synopsis is so misleading i was very hesitant to watch it but the plot that mal gives only last like seconds before it gets fun as hell clannad its hard to summarize since it is a vn it begins with a haremish tone the studio went with the idea of doing arcs despite s the chosen girl being obvious since the first episode it basically goes with the mc helping a girl and moving to the next many call the first season boring for this since when the climax comes it gets boring but many can go through it with the good comedy after story begins the same at first but it develops into the proper story it is a long way but i think that it was worth the trouble as really was a great experience if you got problems with the first season you might find as redeeming but its better to ask here if it is worth to watch
anime,removed,im looking for an anime where theres a girl like rem from rezero which declares her love for the mc and the mc falls for her sorry for bad englando and thanks in advance
anime,removed,the ln debacle after the anime takes a wrong turn in every possible way is in part responsible for the hate the anime has some that hate mashiro for being the winner in the kandabowl when was clear from the start that nanami had chance and for being a halfautistic girl

anime,removed,got a rather large list of dropped stuff to name a few gintama unfunny trite bullshit very very few actually funny jokes throughout a good thirteen or so episodes chrono crusade kinda burned out on anime pretty hard when starting it it didnt really hold my interest enough to keep me watching tough manga s forcing god awful feudal japan clan system bullshit into a modern system and doing it unfathomably bad everyone is a superhuman freak of nature and power levels make no damn sense whatsoever hajime no ippo s dont get me wrong i love the series i only stopped reading at about chapter or so i just got sick of it all it seemed like it was being so bloody melodramatic and i really lost interest after a while fairy tail i absolutely love this series i really do s but this fucking newest arc is the worst thing ive ever read literally the worst thing ive ever read i like to use pupa as a measurement of failure in its purest form but the alvarez arc transcends that there is no salvaging that fucking disgusting miserable heap of shit and failure trees died to print that shit it is doom repercussions of evil to the power of polio virus so uhh kinda completely given up on the manga berserk i love grimdark but this is too pointlessly grimdark it just seems like its just an endurance contest of how much awfulness you can take before you just tap out battle royale we dont talk about it theres a lot more but these are the more prevalent ones i can think of

anime,removed,hi guys idk if you guys remember me from my post about visiting the blanc and eclare flagship store in sohoit got removed z anyway i just left the grand openingfan signing and i wanted to share the experience with you all since many requested it so i showed up around was officially supposed to start at there were a decent crowd of people maybe like in total at first it was a bit messy as the official guests were mixed with fans who just showed up but after a while everything was sorted and lines were made i was very impressed by the staff they were really calm and they even remembered my name from prior visit i really appreciated that so anyway onto the good stuff once i got inside the store was divided by ropes and on one side was the fansign and the other was the actual grand opening party with invited guests and press i brought an album for jessica to sign as well as a dimension concert shirt for krystal to sign unfortunately krystal disappeared once the fan signing began so i didnt get to see her xd so once i finally got in front of jessica i was in actual awe shes insanely beautiful and ive seen a lot of female celebrities here in the city but jessica is something else her blonde hair suits her so well shes the definition of stunning ive met her before briefly at a fashion show but actually getting one on one contact with her was surreal anyway jessica said hi how are you i like your cardigan inside i was like um jessica jung likes my cardigan god is real and good but i miraculously was able to carry on the conversation like a normal person and replied really thanks i thought youd compliment my scarf actuallyi was wearing a be scarf she laughed and said something like i designed it so i thought it was implied that i like it so i took out my album and told her i actually had her sign it once already at fashion week she was surprised and said really i think i remember you were you wearing sunglasses or something then i was d i was taken aback by the fact that she kinda recognized me like how does someone with so many fans remember that anyway so the with love j album comes in a box with the actual album inside jessica signed the front of the box when i met her earlier this year so she told me itd be better if she signed the actual album instead of two signatures on box cover and she opened it and asked for my name and signed it i wont include the whole conversation as its a memory i want to keep for myself but i will say that it was just amazing i didnt feel rushed at all jessica was warm and laughed and listened to my words intently ill remember it forever i didnt trust myself to tell her everything i wanted to so i wrote a letter and she took that with a smile and said shed read it on the plane oh but i will tell you that i got to talk to her a little about her comeback i told her how surprised i was that she was having a comeback so soon and that she spoils us too much she laughed and said i love giving you guys music to listen to so im just as excited as you are i then quickly asked what kind of sound wed be getting for this new single and she did the mouth zipping motion and said sorry and to just wait a little longer for details i was so wrapped up in the conversation that i forgot to ask for a picture which im not really that sad about as im just thankful i had such great conversation with her i felt like i was drifting on a cloud as i left the store so overall just a really amazing experience for me im so thankful that i didnt freeze up or anything once i got in front of her im beyond excited for her comeback and i hope i get to meet her again so she could sign my copy of her next album
anime,removed,i love watching a comedian that has zero talent try so hard at making such shit comedy im shocked at the little following he has because hes trash this skit talk bad about music then make a bad representation of said music is something thats been happening way way back weird al but honestly this is the real thrash shit stand up this is the age of shit people like amy schumer you cant dislike any music because music is incredibly subjective analyzing it scholarly manner would reveal all music to be inferior due to the highest level of music in university being western classical lots of rules on the right and jazz on the left lots of freedom with some composers that fall in the middle but these two generes are dying because theyre not accesible to the average joe too musically complex or too boring what ever their excuses music is incredibly subjective and to go up on stage and bomb like fucking clown is just sad shut the fuck up go and write some good material and call me when you actually get some where stand up is dying and with this shit over the top jokes that have no depth you make fun of shit thats right there i could sit here and trash rock and say it all sounds the same and who could debate me its all subjective even in subs that are about high fidelity and most people listen to very good music its all more or less the same just skewed into what sounds better on said system there are still a small crowd that listen to rap hip hop theres a huge crowd for rock but not limited to the new shit their making today or the old shit that floated in the past and everything in between and guess what there people that listen to the music you call shit with excitement let me tell you a story music is shit why because who the fuck can tell you a track is good me you your so your bff hell no none of those people in fact most of these people can say hey i know a good pizza joint but a good track is literally more difficult why well first what the fuck do you like rap well new or old or wait hip hop or wait new stuff now like drake or harder like wayne its fucking a rabbit hole and the convo can go like this i like jazz great any instrument because theyre is jazz specific solo or more prominent instrument instead of voice drumming piano guitar sax theres like types of sax trumpet bass big band and a few more there are literally people considered fucking messiahs in the context of those instruments but what if they guy doesnt even like jazz hes likes sinatra which jazz boner would tell you to fuck right off and say you dont know shit about jazz yeah you know why its called accessibility what gets on the radio is what can stand on the world stage because its pleasing now if you want music so you can think and appreciate like a painting or a good movie not an action movie which if you were to compare music a movies any radio pop rap country would be like action and anything more complex would be like drama you cant do listening it out of your shit ass car stereo most people also have some shit setups listening to vinyl on fucking briefcases or listening to music on headphones and then saying your a music lover shut the fuck up and fuck music the more ive been in the game the more i hate every single one of you i want to shit on all your faces and fuck your armpits back to the point music is too subjective to make fun of it i can always attack the revenue is it bad if it makes money i know lots of great bands that never made it or that ended too soon because well they just didnt get popular enough sucks but thats the truth if you want indie to be more popular tell bands to play more tours i havent seen any come down in ages to my city i know youre gonna dv its cool i know you cant stand to be wrong or that some one has a diff opp than you you shit sorry excuse for a fucking person you dont know shit but i know you you shit on country but you love drake or fucking bullet for my valentine or nirvana or any of the fucking crap shit music the world says is good and relevant you are trash you think because thats what the internet tells you to think you dont like jazz because its boring same for classical same for pink floyd led zep songs are too long beatles are too pop lmao you dumb fucks havent heard the beatles enough to even know how incredibly incorrect that statement is do you see the trend you are shit youre taste is shit your comedy is shit if you read this thanks its and i just took a burning shit and had to get all this anger of my chest

anime,removed,which episode is the death in
anime,removed,but to the audience that havent seen the show how do they know its not a spoiler for instance i could talk about kyons death at the end of the series just because i brought it up the audience that sees this will know he may die at the end if you respond with he doesnt die then you just spoiled that he doesnt die in the series
anime,removed,granted he got tortured to the point where he couldnt return to what he was so he had no other choice

anime,removed,til yayaka is just an abstract collection of lines and color she is in no way an attempt to depict a human being but actually just random light this made me realize something if i masturbate to child pornograhy im not actually nutting to children its just an abstract congregation of light phew good thing the only way you can be a pedophile is by actually raping kids im normal thats my impression of the downvoters howd i do
anime,removed,literally any insult you could throw at me would be less worse than the insult people like you wear with pride assuming you enjoy lolis xd
anime,removed,he didnt really change as a person until itachi died he just intentionally acted like a hardass afterwards he became a tier shithead though and you cant really blame him for being a psycho he shouldnt even be able to function at all given what he went through
anime,removed,if you torrent its partly your fault its not really studios barely get any money from tv views since most of the anime we watch is really niche late night stuff and never expected to generate big money in the first place they studios split money from bddvd sales with distributor they are contracted with for a particular show sometimes from other merch sales too using paid services like funicr does not give the studios money in any way either studios are paid by those streaming services prior to the start of the series also some studios are owned by those distributors like is owned by aniplex who is in return owned by sone media entertainment and are literally sitting on money so no my torrenting is not doing them any harm
anime,removed,i had fune wo amu on my list too s but then came the sudden timeskip while i understand why it had to be done and it was actually done pretty well but i felt we missed out on majimes whole relationship arc
anime,removed,i torrent everything not because i dont have the money but because i dont bluray there isnt any buying of digital anime and just having it only streaming fuck streaming honestly

anime,removed,for me it was more the parents turning into pigs thing
anime,removed,i hope there is an interactive aspect where you get to choke the fuck out of asuka
anime,removed,sent you a pm
anime,removed,hey im appreciative youre curious about my opinion ive watched all of shinkais longer films and nearly all of them have strong themes of distance and romanticizing the innocent eagerness of kids the emotional rawness of teenagers typically in contrast to adults which are often depicted as burdened by everyday life and no longer living the same rich emotional life as younger people i think garden of words is groundbreaking as far as shinkais work goes because it addresses distance in a socially controversialunacceptable relationship between a student and a teacher i think its groundbreaking for japanese culture in general because of how social misfits are shamed strongly stronger than in the west while garden of words features them prominently like the teacher drinking beer and chocolate all day and skipping work even the student dreaming of making shoes instead of pursuing college i also strongly admire the use of dialogue in the garden of words in my opinion the dialogue is remarkably minimal but more impactful than most films shinkai really makes each word count whether its purpose is creating an atmosphere telling a little backstory a little friendly banter between family etc the minimal use of dialogue also makes it difficult to keep track of the characters emotional states and how they feel about the other studentteacher which changes quickly since im not japanese it was difficult to pick up on honorific changes and notice common facialexpression cues so the first time i watched the confrontation i was rather surprised because it didnt go how i would expect after having rewatched it multiple times and getting better at noticing the subtle social cues at play in japanese culture the final confrontation really does make sense but for me characters still resonate as fully separate fully conscious and feeling and thinking human individuals i feel like his presentation of the story between the two characters does not handhold the audience at all many stories rely on inner monologues and thought expositions to help the audience understand the inner thoughts of characters but shinkai shied away from that in garden of words though not in his other works which is more challenging for the audience but keeps more mystery in our personal understanding of the character overall this is much more similar to how we interact with people in real life and to me this really fleshed out the characters in garden of words as full human individuals despite the film only lasting min with fairly sparse spoken dialogue the symbolism of the story addresses the human experience at a different angle than any of shinkais other works in my opinion it addresses a facet of japanese culture though also broader human culture that japanese works in general do not typically address the shoes are the most powerful imagery in the short film the student is an aspiring shoemaker and over the course of the film he makes a pair of shoes for a woman who experiences physical anxiety when living a normal life in the public realm working at her job going to a park instead of working is odd bad and not typical of what society expects you to do in public in asian culture you take your shoes off when entering a home a private space so shoes are definitively a tool used when individuals enter a public space more generally homes are the space where family resides or friends or yourself if you are living alone while the public space is where you interact with human society at large in the public space especially in japan there are strong expectations to conform to use the right honorifics be polite to strangers have a job that helps society in general dont complain about working overtime etc etc society is a difficult beast and our individual relationship to society is complex and one of the most important relationships we have as a person a common struggle throughout teenagehood to adulthood is transitioning from largely receiving from society to being expected to give to society captured in the question what do i want to do with my life where not doing anything for society is typically viewed as a bad answer within this framework which i find quite reasonable i dont think im stretching too much here the story of garden of words is about an adult who struggles with her relationship to the public space to society in general she meets a boy a social outcast at a time of mutual emotional need at the ending a gift of handcrafted shoes represents healing in her relationship to the public space in the the boy says i was practicing how to walk too i believe that now one day when i can walk much further on my own i will go see her similarly to the lady the boy doesnt quite fit within society though not as extreme as the lady his life is no cakewalk either and at the end his dialogue cements the interpretation that he was in need of healing too another interpretation of the entire theme about walking is more straightforwardly being able to walk through life a common theme in all of makoto shinkais works is exploring human connections which he idealizes created through abnormal means like kimi no na was switching bodies cms can also be viewed in this perspective and in fact i imagine this is one angle that shinkai used to come up with the story by asking the question what if these two adults passing by each other at a train stop had a deep important human connection despite only having known each other in elementary school i think shinkai explores abnormal human connections in garden of words by asking the question what if two people came to know each other strictly through private means instead of starting in the public space it makes lots of sense through this question why both characters would be somewhat social misfits and i think what cements this interpretation is the fact that neither of them knows each others name or occupation other than the boys obvious high school uniform until the end after seeing each other at the park for months name and occupation clearly being some of the first things you discover when you meet someone new but they have it completely inversed the very first observations are of their private shameful pleasures beerchocolate during the day sketching shoes i think i particularly like this story personally because i wish i could get to know someone deeply without having to play the public social game first i crave late night talks about anything and everything rather than the stifled set of appropriate conversation topics at meetandgreets and mixers shinkais theme of distance is portrayed by the final confrontation there are ideals on both sides reality closes in the lady rejects the exclamation of love by putting on her teacher hat again notably by correcting the boys use of a lower honorific into a higher honorific another point that supports the privatepublic interpretation is that the boy responds by saying arigato gozaimashta which is the highest honorific form of thank you primarily used by restaurant owners to customers or other similar financial transactions it is jarring bizarre to hear him use it because it is only used between strangers strangers interacting in public one could dream that getting to know someone through the private sphere first might enable a close relationship a fantasy fulfilled but through the rejection shinkai shows that there is still distance between the two characters but in the final part of the confrontation when the lady runs down the stairs and expresses her true emotions shinkai seems to suggest that this relationship was meaningful and worthwhile despite humans being complicated and of course garden of words art is absolutely incredible the storys slower pace means that garden of words art will probably still be easier enjoyed than kimi no na was art as well though i guess well have to wait for the version of kimi no na wa to definitively say to sum up i like garden of words for its presentation art use of dialogue and for tackling a story that few other film makers have attempted i also like it because shinkai breaks away from the sameold motifs he uses repeatedly in all his other films garden of words is certainly more experimental in its story than most of his other films

anime,removed,one more thing all and all the ending of eoe may seem rather optimistic and hopeful but theyre stuck in a post apocalyptic wasteland with no food water or shelter in short theyre fucked and the show spends too much on nuances character development and symbolism but not enough on the actual goddamned plot why do the angels exist what are lilith and adam where and what are the lances from to learn all of that you have to read additional material that if im not mistaken only came out with the blurays
anime,removed,everyone says its silly to expect the female lead forgot name to wait fifteen years for him that there wasnt any real romance there but i call bs its anime love interest waiting that long can fall right in line with japanese romance tropes airi sp was a weak character and an even weaker love interest seriously main girl straight up ntring him with his friend made me feel so much butthurt
anime,removed,the show loses its magic once you realize that literally nothing is at stake because of subarus ability s when an important character dies you know there will be a reset and you know there will be resets until subarus gets a satisfying ending
anime,removed,is that image spoilers for rebellion or something was reported for it should add a warning if it needs it

anime,removed,so wilhelm is fine just in another dimension
anime,removed,yes in terms of the ln progression the end of the anime the last scene where they summon the old deus is actually from like light novels ahead of the werebeast arc the movie is about the original battles that lead to tet becoming the one true god and the creation of discworld
anime,removed,i wouldnt be too sure about that i think reinhardt is even more special than a normal version of the master swordsman as i am assuming this whale would be fodder to him in fact in the rezero world we could find out later down the line that this whale was actually one of the weaker mabeasts which would show that having the title of master swordsman doesnt necessarily mean ungodly powerful as theresa was killed by the whale and its just that reinhardt was blessed beyond belief
anime,removed,plot twist satella is the previous incarnation of not emilia but rem

anime,removed,reverseyandere i love you so much ill make sure you never permanently die no matter how much death you suffer through
anime,removed,yeah ive seen it in a lot of youtube comments i just felt like fma had better character development for instance almost all the homunculi had a really deep background story and the antagonists like dante and hoenheim were portrayed very humanly which made them more relatable to me at least
anime,removed,and doesnt even a resurrection spell s he has for himself
anime,removed,i love emilia

anime,removed,still my unrivaled number when it comes to these kinds of scenes the whole buildup with the song already playing quietly in the background then transitoning into full volume at just the right moment of the song sends shivers down my spine combine that with the importance of the scene episodes of mostly soly comedy with a bit of timetravel shenanigans leading to this moment that marks the change in course for the rest of the show and you have an utterly amazing scene
anime,removed,lets see you say that when they have to cram rps kid mikitaka highway star stray cat superfly enigma thats not my dad cheap trick and bite the dust into episodes
anime,removed,well since someone already mentioned punch line how about haifuri an allgirls naval school gets thrust into combat the day a new class arrives and the cause is some weird mind controlling disease carried by mice who manage to swim onto a whole buncha ships
anime,removed,you realize that every loop he makes that pillow he ends up dying and the only time he survives is the when he is too busy doing actual work to make one
anime,removed,so did i miss something or did madhouse make a really dumb decision and skip over the scene s the princess commands ikta to ascend the military hierarchy to help her save the country by decisively losing the war with kioka on purpose this seemed like a huge plot point for the story as it sets the longterm goal for the series and gives ikta incentive to do well in the military rather than slack and just get by otherwise whats the point are they just saving it for the end

anime,removed,fullmetal alchemist would fit the bill throughout the series the main cast see death all around them the elrics refuse to accept their mothers death and literally paid an arm and a leg for their stubbornness then theres nina tucker and maes hughes both became attached to the two brothers and soon after died a horrible death in retrospective i believe that their deaths signify that shit happens to good people fma deals with grief by showing the boys that one is not truly alone in this world and that help is out there to help you move on and keep on living
anime,removed,the only problem i have with the ending is it felt like a copout if youre going to bother going full incest you might as well just do it

anime,removed,but josuke and jolyne tho
anime,removed,im rather new to anime so take it with a grain of salt concerning my thoughs i enjoy how the show is making fun of itself and a few common tropes dialogue has been outstanding animation was unusual due to the focus on dialogue i assume took some time getting used to especially the splitsecond texts at some points it felt a little infodumpy especially gaen in owarimonogataris shinobu mail arc new here dont know how to spoiler you probably know what im talking about second anime after ngnl where fanservice wasnt urging me to drop the show because of its creative delivery that sometimes even adds to the plot also character development wasnt limited to the respective persons arc kinda pissed i still dont know how araragi became what he is not to mention the convoluted timeline tldr expected a movie got a slideshow enjoyed it favorite arc hitagi end because kaiki plot twists character development and its really cool ost especially the op best girl never quite understood what that is about but my favorite character is kaiki his development throughout the series is astonishing
anime,removed,no
anime,removed,they dont find the mother

anime,removed,he is still alive his disease hasnt been stated yet as if all i know but he maintains a very strict diet and regular hospital transfusions my guess is some genetic hyperthyroidism based off of his obesity
anime,removed,i would have given kimi no na wa a if it werent for the characters losing their memories the name and appearance of the characters is understandable but after everything theyve done for each other i would have preferred that they had some memories to cling onto

anime,removed,initially i disliked sakuya in the visual novel reminds me of archer
anime,removed,i would suggest rezero the scene which rem was crawling towards subaru and using her blood to damage his chains i would feel goosebumps every time i watch it

anime,removed,what is this and anybody ever watching it
anime,removed,i found some on baka tsuki and animesuki
anime,removed,it was pretty obvious that akira would win when in season the writers posed him as a knowledgeable opponent who had serious scenes honestly who cares about hisako the side character at this point her character is just boring
anime,removed,yeaah i think thats a no go its maybe good story wise but youre not gonna pull anybody without the main cast

anime,removed,for being a heavily policed state criminals have a rather easy time running their trade criminally asymptomatic people as governors of said state really having fucking psychopaths determining whether others are psychos am i the only seeing the contradiction here by the time we got to the hyper oats nothing could really surprise me for a dystopian story to work it has to show how the world functions before toy strip it down for its hypocrisies shinsekai yori did it right yes it was boring but that means that you could believe the illusion that everything is fine
anime,removed,thanks whats that about him being disgusted that ram is alive
anime,removed,contrast his behavior with shirous shirou doesnt give jack shit about being acknowledged for what he does and partly what makes his ideals so tragic in ubw wherein we know where it ends as a death robot controlelled by god subaru however isnt broken like shirou is and isnt driven by a near perfect altruism subaru wants to be acknowledged for what he does heres a small example suppose i as a kid break something i come clean right away and i am not punished because i was honest and came clean the next time though i am punished for whatever reason and im upset because didnt i come clean didnt i admit my faults why are you punishing me for doing good see thats subaru in a sense and this is why subaru is so relateable to me personally i understand that aspect of him i didnt come clean because it was right i came clean because i expected to not be punished for doing wrong i came clean for the reward

anime,removed,his parents died when he was young gozaburo kaiba only adopted seto and his brother because seto won a bet against gozaburo which seto kinda backmailed him into taking in the first place gozaburo confiscated all his toys because seto wanted to build a theme park for orphans was beaten by adoptive father and teachers was given of kaibacorp and told he had to return the amount in year as his bday present invented a vr system for playing games which gozaburo took away and tried to use for war had his younger brother kidnapped multiple times was shot at had to fend off various attempts to take his company from him had multiple other attempts on his life and he could never beat his frenemy yugi like no wonder this guy is a bit of dick sometimes his life has been terrible despite the wealth he has
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i swear when kakero finally tells his friendsnot his friends from his old school but the ones from his new one that his mom committed suicide and he started crying man that shit got me the anime is called orange
anime,removed,uninteresting the characters this is the most criticized point of the show and honestly cant understand why the characters were never meant to be interesting or special in any way theyre just regular kids that were selected to be guinea pigs test subjects for the ethics committees experiment and most people fail to understand theyre nothing like us their actions might seem unconventional to us but they grew up in a society very different from ours with morally doubtful values always surrounded by mysticism intrigue and lies
anime,removed,sorry for the late response but obviously it made me cry because its just gut wrenching she finally realised that she loved him but it was too late he was already gone and there was nothing that she could do its a metaphor for life really the imagery along with the soundtrack used lost my pieces just amount to a perfect tearjerking scene

anime,removed,i think is great and was fantastic for being as short as it was but delta was just really bad nothing that happens has consequences other than messer dying even keith losing an eye is glossed over because an episode later hes flying better than when he had both eyes mirage only existed so kawamori could check the box for a love triangle without putting any effort into it because he originally wanted delta to be about pilots paired with walkure members but satelight wouldnt let him and pushed the triangle on the new series the entirety of the last episodes add almost nothing and could be cut down to four episodes tops the conflict was resolved completely and sort of just ends abruptly it had a completely laughable excuse for destroying the entire nuns fleet of bogues scenes were stock footage of him yelling in the jet and chuck was a character that existed with almost no screentime despite being one of the four or so main pilots literally every member of the windermere pilot group as someone who really like the first twelve episodes the entirety of the last twelve had constant problems really makes delta one of the weaker macross entries i think i even like zero more by the end which is saying a lot since before episode ten or so i was starting to like delta more than basically everything but sdf dyrl and

anime,removed,heero or hiro is a gundam pilot sent from the colonies to help overthrow the military regime of oz his identity was supposed to be secret but relena saw him and knows hes the pilot of the gundam he says hes going to kill her here basically so he can keep his cover so of course they kindasorta fall in love as only protagonists in an anime can and then heero later selfdestructs his gundam because hes tired of wearing his skin tight shorts cant blame him honestly i may have a detail or two incorrect
anime,removed,that one episode of re zero where rem became a tub of toothpaste

anime,removed,i am a simple man i hear gintoki i watch show
anime,removed,well i guess every other straight male loves figure skating just never told me about it and its clearly a super popular sport among my peers or older males comparable to soccer football or swimming youre welcomed to try and prove me wrong i couldnt find any statistics but im fairly confident figure skating in general is much much less popular than a dozen other sports in my age and gender demographic add to that the fact that men arent interested in watching men dance or figure skate and you get the general idea
anime,removed,sorry im not a pedophile my dude
anime,removed,rip
anime,removed,i dunno she saw him in his pilot suit in the middle of what was supposed to be a secret mission him threatening her to in order to keep quiet makes a certain amount of sense
anime,removed,so since your name is doing so well will we get more body swapgender bending anime heres hoping for
anime,removed,it basically did what would be a bad end in a vn as a character arcs end
anime,removed,loli is a term used by pedophiles you are showing your true face with this thread ranime this community should be banned
anime,removed,the girl in the first arc got the big black pedro
anime,removed,great episode about rose man that last moments was intense also i really appreciate giving rose a full backstory here as it was sorely lacking in the game i mean its mentioned but there wasnt exactly elaborated cause one of the big bad showed up which suddenly shifted the narrative oh yeah if you ever wonder why the prince didnt die sorey preparing to purify with his sword is the clue

anime,removed,bruh dont judge besides its okay if time travel is involved
anime,removed,to give some more context the show spent three episodes building up two characters and their gradual realization of feelings and then they essentially gave the audience the middle finger kicked them in the face poured on gasoline and set it all on fire
anime,removed,its either should have or shouldve but never should of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i would say full on molesting your daughter is worse than slapping your daughters ass both were fucked but i feel like bath scene got more popular
anime,removed,i understand that the last episode was a disappointment but i dont think it was that bad she wanted to study abroad and didnt want to be in a relationship on the duration of it the ending also gave us the impression that in the end they came to be together again whatever that means but of course ill agree that she was stupid as fuck they could have dated for year and then get into a long distance relationship for the rest years but no why do that not to mention that the show implied they never spoke after that beach scene wtf is that bullshit goddammit
anime,removed,i know this has been beat to death but i love emilia had me swearing at my computer screen
anime,removed,op reevaluated tokyo ghoul doesnt have proper mal link expects readers to know if its a positive negative or reaffirmation reevaluation dumbass a lot of the anime movies i rated highly i couldnt even get past the slow painful cringe opening scenes so they went down actually most of the anime i rated highly were probably because i was so desperate to find an anime worth watching that i had ridiculously low expectations im in the process of reevaluating all of the anime ive completed
anime,removed,just be sure you keep your head on strait dont want to lose it like a certain blonde girl
anime,removed,on a positive note kaori is still alive why is it raining
anime,removed,rip s once again misaka were very sorry misakas for httpswwwredditcomranime treating you like fodders s yet again
anime,removed,i mean chimera ant arc had its problems and drug on for far too long but i thought it was a fantastic arc from beginning up until most of the way through i had a great time with the arc s until they introduced that hideous blind abomination and had cell knockoff play a board game with her for fifty episodes personally my vote is and probably always will be s that stupid fifteen minute long segment of learning about some pricks hilariously tragic backstory
anime,removed,idk i just use gogoanime pretty good
anime,removed,honestly i laughed through all those episodes s when i tried to get back into anime i asked for a good romance show and some asshole recommended this to me after the kissing scene i was all this is going to be awesome but its the only romantic moment in the show so its both my favorite and worst scene
anime,removed,takumis alive but ikomas dead from now on takumi will hear ikoma through that stone
anime,removed,ubw s the entire first season after the first episode s shirou vs archer
anime,removed,yeah i bet the rest of the episodes would have to be getting korosensei out of the barrier so he can attend their graduation and s kappa

anime,removed,s i finished this series yesterday and this twist was crazy i didnt expect it but it was great though i think satsuki and matoi ending up being related was the twist that had me most shock
anime,removed,for the first time now i understand ranime truly has bad taste
anime,removed,post steinsgate and hunter x hunter came out in and they are in the top and also you should spoilertag rem killing subaru

anime,removed,monogatari till the infamous toothbrush scene being a hater of fan service unless its made by gainax or trigger i only have regrets watching a show smearing naked autistic horny girls and a horny asshole im supposed to root for
anime,removed,the first episodes were pretty good in my opinion character interactions were great especially inaba however some issues concerning the other characters took way too many episodes of a episode series just to get over it this is especially seen in the last episodes they were such a drag to get through because s iori and her identity crisis i found it hard to watch because it i kept visualising her as yui from kon due to her va and i hate seeing a downbeat yui additionally im extra salty because they had the fucking nerve to introduce us dereban but not give us any extra episodes for us to see it in action
anime,removed,i have some bad news for you son
anime,removed,this is ffxv i wanted not that gay shit
anime,removed,lol true it will be hilarious to see peoples reaction for her character later on
anime,removed,yooo kira hype
anime,removed,xdd it funny because it is a man xddddddd
anime,removed,so s shredded cheese
anime,removed,well its not really cheese s head cheese or brawn is a cold cut that originated in europe a version pickled with vinegar is known as souse head cheese is not a dairy cheese but a terrine or meat jelly made with flesh from the head of a calf or pig or less commonly a sheep or cow and often set in aspic the parts of the head used vary but the brain eyes and ears are usually removed the tongue and sometimes the feet and heart may be included it can also be made from quality trimmings from pork and veal adding gelatin to the stock as a binder
anime,removed,s honestly i love how they dealt with it from mei and yamatos reaction to aikos response
anime,removed,s oh okay i gotta get back to it
anime,removed,luffy and nami friend of mine hated theae two characters becuase he thinks they have been acting out of character since luffy beat crocodile thankfully he stopped reading at the time skip
anime,removed,anybody else notice that novas scars look like he had angle wings on his back and the scar on his forehead is similar to where panty got stabbed by stocking
anime,removed,she kisses him while hes sleeping and she wishes he didnt wake up so she can continue kissing him the reason she acts the way she does is because he was nice to her as a child so she developed serious feeling for him because its an anime she still loves him but shes mad at him because he didnt recognize her so she treats him like that and also does if to make sure he doesnt do anything with the other girls

anime,removed,rohan hype
anime,removed,ema and misato are down thats it were assassinating royalty next round
anime,removed,well i can only speak about my personal views but i didnt find the things you mentioned to be all that aggravating a bit annoying yes but she grew out of them later which makes me more forgiving and frankly when she was badmouthing simon to kamina in episode if i were in her place id probably have said the same thing looking at simons character up to that point what it seems is happening is kamina is handing simon the lagann purely out of favoritism which is not smart and would probably end up getting people dead of course we the audience and kamina know what kind of a show ttgl is and that simon does have what it takes but thats knowledge yoko didnt have at that point if there were any complaints i had about her itd be that i wish shed got a bit more character development im happy that she got what she did but itd be nice if she had more especially s her thing with kittan near the end that kind of came out of nowhere and that i find her early character especially her interactions with kamina to be somewhat bitchy i dont like tsunderes very much its rare that i find one i consider wellwritten and likable
anime,removed,personally i didnt find hachiman relateble at all but i did love the show i cant be bothered to do a full writeup so ill summarise phenomenal characterisation and development development isnt linear its dynamic which far more realistic both main girls plus iorha are quite endearing hachimans whole throw himself under the bus to help people shtick is something i havent seen done before it made me do a on hachiman hated him at first loved him by the end only other character thats true of is taiga from toradora and i generally see it as a symptom of good characterisation it doesnt spoon feed you at all you need to read between the lines if you want to know what the characters are thinking funny at times sad at times the outcome of the cliffhanger is hard to predict and to address some of your issues with it s yui acutally likes consistently throughout the show s yui stops talking like a valley girl because shes an emulative person and she stops hanging out with the popular crowd to put it simply the valley girl thing was and act that she soon dropped s youre right they rarely say what is on their minds but thats just the kind of people they are emotionally immature for the most part no doubt theyll gradually grow and mature past that when if the show ever continues it definitely seems to be heading in that direction and i imagine it will eventually reach a point where theyre all able to be much more open with eachother as many scenes in suggest it will
anime,removed,for all we know chiaki dying is the reason why the class becomes the remnants of despair
anime,removed,making the best girl go through all of this should be crime punishable by the death penalty ill be a temple of salt until this gets solved the webnovel is currently on arc
anime,removed,to start if you liked the anime i highly recommend that you read the first chapters a lot of content was rushed or skipped in the anime the reason people say there doesnt need to be a is that it feels like the author isnt planning ahead like she did with the first arc s do you remember how yamada thought odagiri convinced ushio to betray him their freshman year causing him to be labeled as a delinquent apparently a second witch modified their memories this witch odagiri ushio yamada and some other girl sora all used to be friends sora had feelings for yamada but something happened so she asked nancy the witch to erase everyones memories yamada uses another witchs powers to discover this only to find out that another set of memories has been erased or altered within the lost memories now yamada has been trying to find out what happened that caused this set of memories to be wiped out did i mention that the entire cast outside of ushio and noa got their memories wiped of yamada again so that he had to start his relationship with them from scratch tldr the author has decided to go the inception route with memories and confuse the fuck out of everyone theres more stuff i dont feel like explaining like s the two new groups of witches including an all male group ushio becoming a seventh witch etcapologies for the confusing explanation but this shit has been going on years now and i cant remember all the details
anime,removed,im craving an anime similar to charlotte steinsgate or rezero preferably time travel if you can tell
anime,removed,ive been streaming it from gogoanime yeah the plot is very slow but time just flies watching it because it is so engrossing if i was watching it while it was airing id totally be craving the next episode every week
anime,removed,futabu
anime,removed,the anime stardust crusaders stardust crusaders diamond is unbreakable you dont need to worry about any of the older adaptations like the old stardust crusaders ova because the newer ones effectively replace them its not a time travelly series but it spans a large amount of time because each part generally focuses on a different protagonist from a different time period so phantom blood first episodes of focuses on jonathan joestar in the late century then battle tendency focuses on his grandson in the then stardust crusaders focuses on his grandson in the and so on

anime,removed,what a faggot he didnt understand haruhi not at all not at all
anime,removed,at the end of akira tetsuo is so powerful he ascends from having a physical form and creates a big bang
anime,removed,if they make a and adapt this scene remember the reaction to episode of rezero with rem i think people will react to it in a similar way
anime,removed,so the thing i read about the characters having abilities was true afterall im guessing onoes ability is related to her hearing the detective and mio

anime,removed,sorry but whos rem
anime,removed,im older than you for the majority being heavily involved with anime is a phase that lasts for about years before moving on to something else and in these days where anime is easily accessible and has been for years you either encounter and stick to anime as a teenager or young adult or most likely never looking at the join dates the crowd at animesuki seems to be older in general on the other hand this also hints that this community is dying

anime,removed,the asuna rape scene broke me cringe wise
anime,removed,in boku dake ga inai machi when kayo hinazuki cried over breakfast that satorus mom made
anime,removed,breaking is an overstatement but that episode when the strawhats burn the merry really caught me off guard

anime,removed,undefeated you lost every battle if you actually cared about your nation youd make some sacrifices of your own you surrendered at vermillion not because the people of the fpa chose it but because you didnt have it in you to fire god forbid you did fire because then youd have to take responsibility and lead the nation but no youd rather just play house while the nation falls to pieces around you truly the hero the fpa deserves but not the one it needed if it actually wanted to survive just to make it clear i love yang wenli too but a roasts a roast
anime,removed,yeah but it wasnt the tsundere she killedin fact that series had no room for a tsundere because the mc actually acted on his impulses

anime,removed,as of grand order we know that he claimed the very essence of human ingenuity even if they didnt have it in ancient babylon if a human can come up with it he has a better version if nobody can he still probably has a better version though he might not know he owns it
anime,removed,wasnt this that one arc where kei was dead i understand that there are multiple main characters in gantzbut kei was always the main main character i guess its smart of the studio thats making this movie this arc had a clear goal and a resolution so its adaptable at least
anime,removed,why would i the people who are meant know who they are
anime,removed,im not lyingit really isnt rape its more like magical torture or something like thatits kinda complicating
anime,removed,
anime,removed,that at is nishi but kurono is also in the movie you can hear reika scream kurono in one trailer and see him dead we probably get a flashback at the end of the demon arc and kurono will die there so kato still wants to bring him back
anime,removed,why did haramiharabe have to die
anime,removed,code geass
anime,removed,s dont trust amarti

anime,removed,soulanimesnet yousaidsomethingdumb
anime,removed,s truthfully i didnt mind when truckkun appeared it was an unexpected direction but was an interesting choice to say the least it started then to focus the yuu the male mcs choice to carry on with the music band in order to make it big

anime,removed,i wish they kept the kiss shot thing being against a wall in a tunnel not a fan of her just lying down in an empty subway station
anime,removed,yes every episode is like rems funeral swollen eyes tt
anime,removed,whos rem d
anime,removed,i was so disappointed by this series i thought it tried too hard to be edgydark and dramatic and just went right over the edge to ridiculous to me its bad and not in a so bad its good kind of way spoilers also this crusty old war photographer ends up with the cute young girl i wasnt surprised but the romance in this one seemed just so bad and they were so poorly matched and to keep his age and experience appropriate girlfriend from being angry and hurt they just pair her off with the doctor instead which was so cheap and just came out of nowhere like hey its totally fine because she suddenly has another boyfriend so shes not upset at all that he left her isnt that nice really ruined it for me
anime,removed,let us pray that one day they will make an ova of the oppai route it is simply too glorious to stay unanimated
anime,removed,stranger stranger why are you calling me sister
anime,removed,yeah but shizuru and lucia are guardian girls and what we see in kotori route the one usually played first is that guardian and gaia are cunts which the game then goes into length to try to fix our perspective yes they came off as cunts we know but they have their reasons is basically what the other girls routes tell us
anime,removed,let me reword that the important parts that i cared about
anime,removed,i dont see how subaru has changed his actions were defined by circumstances and were the same except him trying harder second arc is best example of that befriending everyone slacking off in the episode berfiending everyone harder you can argue about suicide being development but he already died times for a person he knew for less than a day
anime,removed,i started re zero the other day it is an amazing series because of how it goes opposed to the otaku tropes of im the mc if i believe then it will happen etc im on episode and i came on ranime to see how everyone else reacted to the mc self destructing then i read the future epiodes reactions i think i will skip straight to episode i dont think im strong enough to watch through everything that happened to rem
anime,removed,is the baka tsuki translation missing some translated parts because there pretty much nothing is translated
anime,removed,im not digging the change in baos posture from manhua her bad posture in the manhua fit her personality well
anime,removed,which is probably the most iconic cg from lucias route yeah that scene really was for me a pinnacle of the lucia route
anime,removed,the whos rem joke apparently got old fast and people hate it now
anime,removed,i know right our good for nothing bluehaired mc literally disturbed their kiss
anime,removed,i didnt make this so dont come yelling at me you cunt
anime,removed,a lot of people like her because shes by far the most powerful thing in the series actively yeah haruhi technically is but nagato is shown to be able to do a lot thats why my friend says he liked her a lot
anime,removed,many anime manage it as a way to develop a character like homura from madoka would also use rezero as example but it is still not finished so far he is only going insane
anime,removed,choicee is between roy mustangs introduction and prides identity spoiling in ep of fma b
anime,removed,but you are seeing that from our world physics point if view if thats so then no anime movie or comic book would make sense humans cant turn into titan because we cant create more mass from nowhere why would a race of gods of death need a notebook to kill people etc
anime,removed,their relationship to me feels very genuine and very honest realistic might not be the most accurate way to put it but there is something there that feels like it rings true to life the vast majority of fictional romances in anime or any other medium are based on very shallow interactions or coincidental things they have in common and somehow this makes the characters instantly obsessed with each other araragi and senjougahara arent like that they start dating for little more reason that mutual attraction and their relationship is pretty awkward and uncomfortable for a while starry sky is the best romance scene i have ever witnessed and thats because it isnt the two characters professing their eternal devotion to each other its senjougahara saying that she likes him a lot and wants to be with him but is scared of everything that entails its awkward and uncertain but so emotionally raw and combined with araragis quiet acceptance and supportiveness it creates a moment thats simple and beautiful and communicates how much these two care about each other without resorting to any silly love confession cliches
anime,removed,hahaha youre that guy who said youre considering dropping soma because your megumi ship died erinamegumi
anime,removed,whos the one with the blue hair theres only ever been one maid in this series dont know why you had to invent another one

anime,removed,okay this is a little silly shirou is a deconstruction of this trope and is in the same boat as astro boy in that hes actually an early arrival of that trope you shouldnt blame shirounasu when its nearly everyone else with their inferior knock offs remember fate route shirou we find out in hindsight is the one most likely to become archer who literally in ubw comes back in time to kill his past self entirely because his i must save everyone attitude is so flawed and self destructive

anime,removed,i dropped your lie in april because they basically tell you by episode that blond girl is going to die and its sad and fuck this show
anime,removed,tbh they are kinda moe when they arent being murderous psychopaths

anime,removed,realize that its not actually that sad and that kaori should have died like episodes before she did in order for better dramatic effect
anime,removed,its literally obvious from the first episode and youre seriously coming into this thread where the op basically spoils that its depressing in the first place seriously if you dont see that shes going to die from basically the first episode you just fail at watching things anyway

anime,removed,just delaying the impending doom
anime,removed,thats a great question in fact that spoiler was one of the very first things i knew i wanted to talk about when designing the course theres a brilliant and when i say brilliant i mean one of my alltime favorite pieces of writing essay by cultural critic sianne ngai called the cuteness of the avantgarde where her basic idea is this by presenting something as cute we unknowingly suggest that its cuteness is simultaneously an indicator of its weakness anything thats cute by extension is automatically threatened by horrific violence of anything that might place itself in power over the cute object we had just read that essay the day before of madoka and for students who didnt quite grasp everything the essay meant this was a perfect illustration of that idea both mami and the witch are naturally incredibly cute

anime,removed,ash winning the kalos league
anime,removed,thats a trap this is a tomboy
anime,removed,but the death note ending was contrived even if light had to be defeated the way it was done two people conveniently writing the same thing so light does not suspect anything wrong made most people believe light should have won in comparison the most criticism one can give the code geass ending is that the peace achieved was temporary at best and later things will eventually go to shit
anime,removed,did the white whale kill her or was it the witch of vainglory
anime,removed,i miss kickass torrents havent had to torrent in awhile what happened to it that was my goto
anime,removed,does anyone wonder why wilhelm remembers theresia if she got killed by the white whale just putting it out there

anime,removed,how about no i got downvoted because of a reaction comment my reaction which is how i felt about the video got downvoted you people need to stop spewing unnecessary hate im just as big of a anime fan as everyone else in this sub even more so since i spent the time to slap together several reaction gif links you people that downvote someone who likes the same content are shitheads it just goes to show that some people are hate spreading mongoloids and nothing will change that
anime,removed,just you wait until you see her stripping scene i guarantee it will be all that everyone is talking about next week
anime,removed,both his parents died before he was born
anime,removed,after watching this episode i literally have more questions about the entire series and i feel like this episode is giving more emphasis on other questions like if canaria actually dieded and what are those things on the back of their necks s this turns into a cross ange where the enemies arent at all what the viewers though they were
anime,removed,not sure why people think the anime showed people dying this episode its pretty clear that the end isnt supposed to show that at all hotaru didnt even think she was in danger btw thats not even new the unknown always captured their victims and never killed and went out of their way to do so even if it reduces their combat capabilities this has always been true in all the lns
anime,removed,sorry but i have no faith in a character who is gonna fuck their sister infront of an open door gotta have some class
anime,removed,hollow ichigo vs masamune was also pretty hype
anime,removed,it wasnt a spoiler shigechi dies
anime,removed,yeah thats for sure novel readers are likely familiar with the concept that the unknown capture and usually dont kill so theyd not assume death just plot but then this episode really didnt seem like a death scene anyway hotaru didnt even deem it necessary to continue fighting keep in mind that its the same character who almost beheaded ichiya for merely punching hime its pretty safe to say that she didnt see any danger from whatever the others saw approach her
anime,removed,hearing kotori saying i have to hurry reminds me of s how desperate she was towards the end of her route it was one of my least favourite parts of the vn because i cant stand her suffering like that i hope i dont have to see it animated my heart cant take it
anime,removed,born from a corpse writhing in a pool of mud blood and afterbirth
anime,removed,i dont have the clip but theres a fight scene in mahouka koukou no rettousei shiba vs ichijou which is epic i watched that episode twice in a row when it was aired just to see that scene again
anime,removed,animefrost
anime,removed,would have
anime,removed,oriemo
anime,removed,this comment has been removed mmm the last bit of that is at least a proper spoiler gonna need it tagged appropriately technically the monogatari bit too have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,removed,animedaocom got that
anime,removed,best mech fight ever the size of these mechs are made very real by and sustained by each of the them crashing into each another i love how you can see the background behind the evas through the cockpit so each time asuka swings or recoils from a hit httpgfycatcomshoddydownrightgerbil the cockpit doesnt exist in some pocket dimension i mean this is something eva was really good at lots of mech fights will take place in space or upper atmosphere in deserts or even over water because they dont have to draw trees or buildings or have them react to the mechs evangelion almost always hosts fights on land and in the city because its cool
anime,removed,as a warning spoilers for up to and including todays episode nothing concrete but you can rougly know how things turn i both love and hate his current personality its quite realistic considering the tons of factors which weve seen affect him which is also why this has turned into one of my favorites its refreshing to not have everything go forwards and turn better but instead just downspiral yet not in a way which is cheap or just to stirr up the audience compared to sao where many have been annoyed about making the antagonists rapey just to create hate for them which many people think is cheap in rezero its also the characters of actions and downsidesflaws that help put him in bad sitautions hes been working thats but havent gotten out of it without mental injuriestrauma and added with his personality and a few other things has made him a pretty grumpy obsesses and negative character hopefully though things start to go better betyr or even worse in the next episode rezero is also mazing in general great songs animation long episodes that skip op and ed ending episodes with cliffhanger or shocking events leaving you quite stunned and dazed before you return to reality not to mention the hurt sound of subaru as it showed the episode title at the end it leaves an i impact it makes for a great experience and we rooted for subaru in the start and i still do i want to see him recover and get better get rewarded for hard work no matter his personality i dont think he deserved what happened in todays episode no one does really
anime,removed,a lot of comments said that rem is winning the best girl contest from the novel readers so there is litterly possibilty that she will stay dead
anime,removed,rem needs a dagger to the head but otherwise its good
anime,removed,no kidding it was amusing near the end where the crowd was going yes no yes no yes
anime,removed,person who watched the anime and read the lns a few years back here one other note to add the proctor ichika beat was ms yamada shes generally clumsy but competent when she has to be such as when s she beat rin and cecilia in a vs match with ease and piloted a special revive unit with chainguns that weighed so much it couldnt move
anime,removed,okabe made it up but then he called the world line he is trying to get to steinsgate so he gave it meaning
anime,removed,which part of telling your love interest you want to get her so deep into debt she can never escape you doesnt strike you as a strategic mastermind

anime,removed,no i think the lap pillow made it into the timeline
anime,removed,i didnt like subaru from the start he is so annoying and stupid i didnt dislike him because of his talk with emilia at episode but because he is just a shitty main character as whole this is going to get downvoted so hard but tbh idc go ahead rezero fanboys downvote this if you havent already
anime,removed,this insanity will come in a point in this arc i really wish this anime could go longer and encapsulate later arcs
anime,removed,exactly this people bitch about subaru not knowing his own limit and kept on pushing for the impossible but what they forgot is that even if hes powerless now he can still change things with his return by death however if he dont act now and wait until he gain enough ability or power to actually help most of the one he actually cared about has been dead for sometimes and then what is the point of gaining those power by that time i hate subaru childish thinking but i also understands that he has no choice he has to act with the current powerless him
anime,removed,mahou shoujo madoka magika i watched this in and i didnt like it as much and the second watch was just rollercoaster of emotions from sadness to anger and frustration i guess since then i have experienced some of these things now like sacrificing oneself for others especially the way spoiler such a great series i will tackle the movies next
anime,removed,whe i first typed this out i kept typing mangaweb comic because i wasnt sure myself xd though manga is technically japanese comics so its an online manga i guess haha s true along with everything else happening it was that hope spot that things would go well for them i think it wouldve been nice if they kept aratas thought process on wanting to stay away from now on along with the confession scene for the new couple there would be a rush of happiness for the viewer that thins would go well for them but at the same time it shows the conflict that they face though they did remove that part since it was ending it would end on a sad note xd
anime,removed,next episode subaru and remget captured and tortured
anime,removed,try searching for an anime site that starts with k it has it i think sadly though it aint legal
anime,removed,the history lesson doesnt matter yes loli evolved from nabakovs novel but the word refers to a drawn childlike girl usually preteen in looks specifically not girls with a body like if you think these girls are loli then you have to consider the majority of anime girls to be loli too the term just loses its meaning if you do that it only refers to a girl that looks like a child as it always has
anime,removed,snag this from bakabt before they blacklist it
anime,removed,a happy ending please spoil meim bad with emotional roller coasters if it doesnt end well
anime,removed,itd be like okabe after trying and failing so many times trying to save mayuri
anime,removed,for the first of the film it was fine but to give an example of where i hated the audience when the pen dropped people started fucking booing sure i get that you wanted it to be successful but dont fucking boo out loud you basically could not hear the fact that the music suddenly stopped the drop of music was supposed to add to the effect but i lost that because of the crowd second potentially spoilers when he does the emotional troll at the very end the crowd kept cheering or booing or even yelling turn around depending on the direction taki was going that just completely ruined the experience as it made the experience not immersive since the loud shoutings yanked me back into reality instead of feeling like i was in the film the guy next to me was one of those that kept shouting as well as two guys in front of me

anime,removed,he doesnt really turn bad his mother dies and he just doesnt care anymore only kills other aliens though absolutely fantastic anime though i loved it
anime,removed,any link to ep yet
anime,removed,i do hate spoilers actually but i realize that its crazy to expect people to watch everything they say i knew going into jjba that dio is killed by josuke its a meme that has been around since before i ever went on the irc channel that showed it to me and ill likewise never be able to watch citizen kane without already knowing that rosebud is his childhood sled these things cannot be kept secret forever and forcing people to be wary when talking about older shows does nothing but hinder the conversation theres absolutely a limit on when spoilers are okay thats just how it is
anime,removed,sonia appeared no escape

anime,removed,you should watch the anime first and than comeback to this comment and reflect on what you just you said you are in for a ride if you didnt read the manga stay out of it until this ends so you can really feel the story
anime,removed,step aside re zero the true king of suffering has arrived
anime,removed,the closest for me would be fma brotherhood rip hughes
anime,removed,from what i understand there is also a long history of cats in japan they could be found natively around the area and therefore became parts of a lot of japanese folklore sorry i cant be more specific but that is the gist of what i have heard
anime,removed,the episode in opm when he shreds lord boros with his multiple normal punches i always thought the reformation process was awesome looking
anime,removed,well ive found this
anime,removed,youre joking right do you seriously consider keijo to be good
anime,removed,good thing your name didnt go the same route lol
anime,removed,yeah pretty much it really just comes down to nasu being nasu theres servants guys jokes theres nevermind theres sike turns out theres ayyy now theres oh jokes it wasnt just
anime,removed,jojos bizarre adventure has a lot of plot holes that youre supposed to wave away because its cool ehhh this was brought up on rstardustcrusaders and overall we couldnt think of any major flaws aside from things like how the hell dio survived underwater for so long and how our favorite french guy was able to make it to part with his soontobe bullshit silver chariot requiem and no king crimson doesnt count since it just works kappa

anime,removed,i just want a nice romance anime where the main characters dont spend the whole show stammering in front of each other and actually has closure from that someone recommended your lie in april now having seen it ill just be a little more clear id like a nice romance anime with closure where everyone lives
anime,removed,whos rem

anime,removed,until she cried at christmas that was fucking sad wanted to hug her
anime,removed,god this guy has a great format edits well and can talk decently just why does he have to have all those shitty opinions which he supports with terrible arguments
anime,removed,heres hoping they do a second season so you can find out what happened to rem
anime,removed,best part of the movie
anime,removed,
anime,removed,did you watch the whole episode its not what you think it was
anime,removed,theres a dvd screener on nyaa worth the watch even with the watermarks and hard subs
anime,removed,my google fucked is seriously lacking and ive been unable to find it can you help a guy out
anime,removed,hyouka that scene from last episode hurts a lot
anime,removed,just so you guys know you can find the movie on most anime websites if you just want to watch it ex gogoanime or if you just want to wait for the release to support the filmmakers then thats fine too
anime,removed,sorry but i think the way we view accomplishing something is completely different i dont think just any form of plot progression is an accomplishment for that reason id say fatezeros first episode accomplishes much more than cross games first episode in spite of the fact that someone fucking dies in the first episode of cross game because i think the way cross game handles that character is that they use her as little more than a plot device later on in the series they decide to even introduce s a completely unrelated lookalike for the sake of drama and character development this is opposed to fatezeros first episode which is solely for establishing character relations ideologies and motivations in a way that allows the rest of the drama and plot to play out naturally its a matter of preference of course and some might not see cross game that way i can sympathize with that since i love clannad despite similar complaints levied against that i do think its overlystrict to force yourself to rate how mal presents things to you rather than maybe how the show presents itself to you or being flexible with your ratings but whatever difference in how we rate things and all that jazz
anime,removed,fuck i lost the translation too its in one of the amagi discussion threads maybe a rewatch one though
anime,removed,super speed super strength sword mastery and immortality on top of that
anime,removed,advance screen spoilers says no romantic conclusion so anything goes kumikoreina has a shit ton of development to back it up so it wont be an asspull unlike shuichi crap

anime,removed,nah reinhardt attacked got hurt instead and he died because he was taking the hit meant for subaru whatifs dont follow the plot true but they follow the canon theyre consistent with the lore of the world just what would have happened if someone had made a different choice at one point rem if is what would have happened if rem agreed to running away and it stays true with the lore of the world as they run away to kararagi and the story details their daily life the echidna if is similar what if subaru had made a different choice thats it theyre like the bad ends from a vn
anime,removed,doesnt chitanda have aspergers
anime,removed,i like trains
anime,removed,death note would be one that fits your title
anime,removed,overlord
anime,removed,to be fair a lot of questions arent answered in the source either we still dont know who becomes king the subaruxemilia ship is still just waved aside as a love at first sight thing with no further explanation the reason for the sudden transport hasnt been explained satellas real motives are unknown so while you can bash the show for that its not like anything can be done about it
anime,removed,ep s sket dance crossover ep s restaurant owners funeral ep s kaguras funeral also the following which i dont really remember the ep number of sacchan gets new glasses nabeleon shogun at the hairdresser reallife gintama the toiletpaper battle bath time with the green demon amanto those are some of my favourites

anime,removed,yep sasuke in boruto is such a g you can definitely see hes learned his lesson
anime,removed,binged your lie in april what an amazing anime some of the scenes had fantastic animation especially the finale the music was so very well executed i never knew so much emotion and feeling could be communicated just from music alone i loved the series from start to finish s kaos illness was like the slowest trainwreck ever that you couldnt look away from it was almost unbearably sad watching her turn into a shell of her former self after her collapse shed keep the playful persona around everyone else but around arima when they were alone it was so sad seeing her talk about herself and the end it was obvious that that the surgery wasnt going to work because the most impactful ending was always going to involve her dying still i kept hoping for the cheesy ending and shed live lol
anime,removed,everything about her is perfect shes pink shes incredibly polite and oblivious she has the hidamari wideface
anime,removed,where are the politics in ibo exactly small intro and final two episodes at most has plenty of civilian deaths it has girls going literally nuts it has an human experiment with double personality piloting gundam a gundam pilot actually dies a tragic death lockon ibo has what biscuit and some nameless kids so far season one had maybe or epic moments and yet no beams but ms can travel into the outer space ok im sorry if you dont agree but the flat characters are in ibo not in ibos unique pivotal plot core is that of childrens fighting a war which isnt really original its a good show maybe will get better with but for now its not as good
anime,removed,your lie in april spoilers your lie in april had something unique going for it it had one of the most interesting plots that set it up into being an anime version of whiplash the movie the anime did a good job setting up and introducing the epidemic that is the competitive nature of parents and how it manifests into child abuse ive lived in the philippines for most of my life and had gone to japan for a year the consequences of these abuse are much much worse even the author admits it was much worse in reality the reason why it failed was because most moments were repetitive musical pieces after the first one were always did it reach himher the motive became extremely cliche while the story sets it self up for arima to recover from psychological trauma it ruined it for me that it turned into a redemption arch for the mother i wish it would have touched on serious subjects more aggressively such as child musicians suicides which i know suicide was mentioned by one of the characters but that was to euthanize them selves from a medical condition i would have expected to see one of arimas competitors also suffering from an abusive mentor i loved the ending with a bitter taste in my mouth i loved kaori as a character her love for music is genuine and the only one to be into music not as a result of anyones competitive nature you put together someone who was forced into music arima and someone who loves it on her own kaori and it creates unlimited potential yet the one who actually enjoys music is the one who doesnt have the freedom to do so thats all just my thoughts though

anime,removed,here is what ive seen so far this year assassination classroom season while the first cour aired on the second season aired on it was a good show and one of the few i felt had closure battery i liked the start of it but quickly derailed and had a really shitty ending erased must watch it was a really good thriller id recommend reading the manga or at least the manga ending too bungou stray dogs solid second season airing soon dimension w enjoyed it the ending was so so i think there is more after the anime in the form of light novel or manga not sure gate japan defense force in another world same first season aired on but the second on it was allright joker game started strong and dropped a bit on the tail end was still good spy thriller kiznaiver made me cry on several ocassions recommended kokoro itai koutetsujou no kabaneri hype train we hyped this every week with friends had a rather shitty ending but it was still good animation was pretty good and shit blew up mumei best girl mayoiga dont relife binged this in one night loved it reading the web toon manga now space patrol luluco trigger bois musaigen phantom world kyoani the absolute madman i enjoyed the show and the animation was superb netoge no yome wa onnanoko ja nai to omotta started for the plot stayed for ako rewrite not sure what i watched might give the vn a try
anime,removed,i watched it on chia anime just now it has the occasional watermark but its not as annoying as others ive seen before it also has chinese subs along with the english ones but theyre hardly distracting at all
anime,removed,i respect your opinion but what does have a dead background character who only appears in a supporting characters backstory have over emilia or rem and all the other girls
anime,removed,i always seem to like new transformations at the climax of the story if were counting mecha then the tengen toppa gurren lagann if not then madokas transformation in the last episode of pmmm was very memorable considering its plot importance

anime,removed,i think jojo does this better because at least its funny and epic there is a reason why bizarre in is its name i mean the s joseph joestars final battle against kars worked because you want joseph to win and the results was well worth it and silly kars being defeated by a volcano and gets launched into space with sono chi no sadame playing in this episode i had enough of suzuko as she does not grow a personality and acts seriously stupid this reminds me of yugioh zexal as we have an annoying protagonist whose duels are like this every episode unless they can make suzuko have an interesting personality i call bs sorry if this sounds offensive this is how i would have done it suzuko loses and the rest of the series is about chinatsu mourning for suzuko and eventually finds suzuko as a trading card i made this up in the spot and it seems better than what the episode provided us
anime,removed,while that is true in realism i believe it meant how the characters react and how they interact between eachother the red haired girl kurisu makise was a american scientist which only joined the rest of the characters because the main character rintaro okabe s bumped into her the first episode and saved her and the rest of the cast is more believeble except itaru which i believe rintaro actually met in high school and became friends with him for that very reason
anime,removed,narutaru context is a bit complicated the girl who gets killed bullied another girl by forcing her to eat maggots and raping her with a test tube the victim controls a giant monster she then uses said monster to kill the girls brother whom she just finished having sex with and the girl in an ironic way through test tube shaped claw rape
anime,removed,i guess the first part comes down to opinion i wouldnt consider if a romance series had a confession or not to be a spoiler but i can see how some might i just dont agree as for how its going to happen its not like thats an image that instantly shows the whole scene its a video you have to click on a sit through if youre worried about being spoiled you can either avoid it when you see the series name or again when you see the video name at the start

anime,removed,dude that rant was on point this is one of the other things i forgot to mention i want to go back to the good ol days where it was all about strategy and observing the weaknesses and strengths of other enemiesallies also going off of what you said s i thought it was total bullshit when the gate did not kill gai sensei now look i love that guy to death as well as rock lee my favorite characters with kekkashi getting a close but when he lived through that attack i was kinda upset i mean the entire naruto series used the revive key characters card during the pain arc you cant just do that again and yeah were at a point where its all about chakra and how much of it you got not teamwork and strategy like how they emphasized that in the very beginning just give me my ships and have a good day

anime,removed,well as it stands i think that heavily relates to s his whole shadow attribute thing if he learns to control that better maybe the hand thing wont happen again another possibility is that s maybe it might be easier for him to explain that thing so say puck or beatrice since neither of them are human and may have some insight into the whole ordeal

anime,removed,did you just spoil
anime,removed,i dont feel any sympathy for ram and rem theyre lunatic sociopaths with everyone but each other i disagree lunatic sociopaths i suspect theyre not human which would give them a somewhat different standpoint from humans they live in a medieval world one with better safe than sorry is an understandable strategy when there are so many unknown potential factors and the slightest mistake can mean the end they work for a faction that is actively competing for the throne of the kingdom their champion just retrieved her qualification for said throne from a thief that was almost certainly hired by a the enemy faction in fact said incident could very well be a plot to get a spy eg subaru into the castle subaru is clearly interested in their champion for the throne he has also managed to gain her trust something that would be very far on the top of a spys list of things to accomplish and most important of all it seems that they have some history with this satella witch whose smell they detect on subaru taking all that together theres no chance that theyre not just waiting for him to reveal his true colors with everyone but each other so far weve only seen them be snarky which i think is mostly an act with subaru only not anybody else

anime,removed,huh thats quite normal for steampunk style having belts and metal on your body is pretty tame for steampunk fiction plus that metal was used to s slow down the spread of the virus now shirtless like of the time idk
anime,removed,a mad scientist accidebtly makes a time machine from a microwave
anime,removed,i knew it he was the cart driver all along
anime,removed,all of them except haganai where the real ending is a literal fuck you yamadakun and amabur both would do so much better with some kind of continuation imo

anime,removed,here is my discussionreview video of re zero episode the sickness called despair tune in and make sure to subscribe
anime,removed,not really its just nothing was all that sad with the back stories maybe had they been displayed and told differently or if the viewer was better able to relate or care for the characters it could have been more upsetting but in most cases you have only just met the character so you dont yet know them or their personalities and they arent very deep once you do know them with the boat its a boat and with aces death it was more of just a shock factor you rarely see ace prior to the war so i cant really say its all that sad oh and i cant open that link for some reason
anime,removed,found the guy that hasnt read the manga guys
anime,removed,i think so detective conan only has
anime,removed,salty onodoormat fangays downvoting because they cant accept the fact that best girl finally won
anime,removed,that one gray haired long haired guy with the brown skin looks middle eastern or some shit get the fuck off the show you fucking foreigner kebab
anime,removed,there really isnt its just that it features a lot of side stories and things that are unimportant to the main plot but still interesting to read and gives us a different perspective on a lot of things that occur in future arcs anime is featuring arc right now and up till now they ignored around side stories where of them were actually important and related to the main plot they actually s subaru tried to tell emilia about his return by death they made it look like subaru was forced to not say anything by some black magic when in light novel it was hand of witch destroying emilias heart and killing her this way puck going insane freezing the entire castle and killing subaru they left it out because they dont have time for side stories and stuff like that can still be explained pretty well later on yet if they showed it the monster in that destroyed the castle at the end would be easy to recognize puck in rage mode there is of course a lot of other side stories they left out and ignored a few explainationsfacts thats why i recommend reading the novel as its really well written and has indepth content
anime,removed,important battle hahahahahaha please read the manga for christ sake

anime,removed,what you gonna do about it diarrhea boy sue me for your own literal diarrhea shit tastes
anime,removed,the answer is torrenting just get a torrent app for your phone so you can use torrent files
anime,removed,holy shit i never watched game of thrones season six after the steaming trash heap that was season five but recently i heard that it was actually good so i decided to give it a try and oh my god i am so glad i did its like dd spent the entire season apologizing to book readers by giving them everything we ever wanted tower of joy benjen white walker origins unjon the greyjoy storyline which tbh im a little disappointed with but its better than nothing and then just now i started episode seven and there he fucking was cleganebowl is happening boys sports
anime,removed,that doesnt tell me much im going to guess you were pmd how to get anime from the high seas i recommend you to recode said shows using a great and simple tool to convert videos to portable devices format httpimgurcombnsfepj httpimgurcombyjcxpl
anime,removed,ill pm you the one i use because were not allowed to mention them on this sub
anime,removed,i love how she is so childish that ushio became quick friends with her
anime,removed,jesus christ everyone has seen it or if not knows the ending from cultural ubiquity did you know that darth vader is the protagonists father in star wars or that zosima dies or that romeo and juliet die of course because everyone does because they are just part of general culture
anime,removed,cardcaptor sakura s look sakuras dad loving old guys as a fledgling teacher is fine and everything but im pretty sure youre supposed to wait until they graduate before you marry them lest you lose your job i love how shaoran tries to be the asshole rival but is too much of a dork to pull it off cardcaptor sakura is still great i like to imagine that the cards are jojo stands and replace this must be the work of a clow card with this must be the work of an enemy stand kon rewatch
anime,removed,now imagine if this pic was actually a spoiler that hes a vampire
anime,removed,i get why ln readers quit the show around these parts now after seeing characters die so much its really losing most of the impact its not even a i feel really bad for the characters feeling but a can we move on in the story please feeling i think we learned that he shouldnt be able to see the unseen hands telling people that he can respawn kills them and that the white whale can seemingly abduct people from existence
anime,removed,one of the whales powers is to make people forget about its victims it happened with the carriage driver with the bandana last episode
anime,removed,as a web novel reader i laugh at your despair it just gets worse from here
anime,removed,isnt the first time you actually see it in the show right before she reveals herself its a spoiler for about seconds of the entire series
anime,removed,this was the peak moment for me and vice versa this is essentially he isnt talking to emilia shes just an empty avatar essentially hes talking to himself the cognitive dissonance is unreal
anime,removed,the whale does not always have to erase the victim if i remember correctly
anime,removed,think youll find they took many a hit from the goblins and only one of them died because he ran out of mana the reason why you dont see the hit points stats exp is because they dont actually know they are in a game and im pretty sure its meant to be ambiguous to the viewer too id like to hear about all the mmo elements that rezero has considering its not even an mmo world subaru is in
anime,removed,suwa is a time traveller thats how future naho managed to send the letters through time
anime,removed,i hope rem comes out okay
anime,removed,whos rem never heard of her
anime,removed,the plot will begin to actually move again next week these episodes are all here to strengthen toyotas resolve
anime,removed,honestly i really liked the changes that they made from the series like s ranka being friends with alto since the beginning it definitely helped their relationship and made the heart break of alto choosing sheryl in the end more believable there were so many fire bomber references in these movies that i enjoyed every second of and as a lot of people have told me the music from frontier really grows on you i hated the op when i first heard it but when s they sang it in the final battle it just hyped me up speaking of s the final battle in the conclusion when alto finally hears the vajras song and he flies towards the vajra queen and confesses to sheryl i was really bummed and honestly i was definitely surprised as for the ending s it did leave me with ambiguity and honestly im not sure how i felt about it its like it is meant to continue overall though very good movies i enjoyed their visual styles as the cg blended perfectly within the story with the non action and the action packs portions of it and of course the music hnnnnnnnggggg was very good characters were amazing they definitely felt more developed here than in the series and it fixed a bunch of stuff that i felt the series could have done better such as s the whole part of sheryl knowing what grace was up to to a certain extent gave a whole new layer to her personality sane goes with alto finally reacting to fold receptors reminds me of hayate from delta and how he reacts with freyja also added to altos personality all in all i fell in love with f and i love the world and characters out of i give the movies a for the first one and a for the second one definitely worth the watch s also did i mention sheryl is best girl of frontier since i finished watching the series i updated my ranking of macross series didnt include delta since its still airing
anime,removed,he dies and respawns at the mansion with rem dead and forgotten and nothing he can do to change it that would truly be the darkest timeline
anime,removed,who is that a figure of who is this rem
anime,removed,thats not true at all have you read the wnln if you havent then dont even bother trying to analyze him tip the witches scent is growing stronger every time he dies take that as you will
anime,removed,great drawing who is it
anime,removed,i dont remember there being a rem in rezero or did they just get the design for ram wrong
anime,removed,huh rem who is that again
anime,removed,fyi kurapikas power is already nerfed he can only use his op chains on spiders and if he uses it on anyone else he dies he can still use lie detector and weaker chain related abilities i think but its a self limit that makes it so much more powerful
anime,removed,hahahahha kill yourself art major retard hhahahahahahahahahahahaahahah have fun making a year hahahahahahahahaha
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,plastic memories simply put i did not expect s where isla actually went peacefully was expecting her to go full wanderer on tsukasa rating or put in numbers
anime,removed,i have this theory where betelgeuse is actually subaru in the future kinda like how archer is emiya i dont have any evidence to support this theory besides the fact that subarus mind keeps breaking bit by bit every time he respawnsnot enough to be a convincing theory but its fun to think about
anime,removed,rem who is it
anime,removed,i dont remember this character whos rem
anime,removed,why would they make a figure of a fanmade recolour of ram
anime,removed,its intentionally left a mystery its implied that pandora the witch of vainglory had a hand in it behind the scenes
anime,removed,why are people acting so weird about ram lately also why does the picture show ram with blue hair dont they know rams hair is red
anime,removed,if i could find a translation for rezero it would be after this episode that i binge read it thank you for posting what you know even though its not what i want to hear f subaru better kill that archbishop before the series ends please
anime,removed,watch it in its original language you fucking degenerate retard
anime,removed,s a v a g e a v a g e
anime,removed,spoilers from light novel apparently the fighter wasnt consumed by the whale just killed
anime,removed,spoilers from light novel and since i cant use spoilerbars spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead okay apparently its reinharts grandmom who was the butlers wife she went there with a small army but got killed along with everyone else the theory is the whale just didnt eat her
anime,removed,if alluka ends up being a calamity like a lot of stuff suggests it could be something people look back on as a bit less of an ass pull
anime,removed,when kakashi unlocks perfect susanoo
anime,removed,this makes a lot of sense honestly its not surprising considering that globally official sub rips are the main way people access anime horriblesubs being the option for most people without access to cr fansubs really become relevant years after a show comes out meaning its lost significance to all but pretty serious fans communities like tsundere bittorrent or a certain feline tracker have nowhere near the download counts that something like hs would have so even if there is a very healthy andor vocal community there they make up an extremely small percentage of downloads
anime,removed,the third one i assume you mean asuka she was brought back after instrumentality which completely falls in line with the shows established rules
anime,removed,so dio throwing a dog into a furnace and having a mother eat her own baby is considered tame well we are talking about the pillar men so i guess thats fair
anime,removed,first s the mechs needs an s engine or whatever that engine was called to move on their without being connected to a power cable or running on batteries for minutes after running out of energy third s everyone died and asuka is brought back to life how funny is that
anime,removed,evas have souls and can achieve some pretty crazy stuff with a high synch ratio evas are kind of emotion based and not average mechs ie berserk mode magic shinji decided that those who wished to return to individual life or stay in the lcl asuka chose to come back she wasnt the only one just the first of many
anime,removed,shokugeki no souma soma is a bit brash in his confidence but never to the point that he makes empty boasts he backs his words up with skill
anime,removed,code geass ubw if you consider archer the mc definetly alderamyn of the sky right now
anime,removed,end of evangelion right
anime,removed,nice botting
anime,removed,eh so far of all the magical girls this one is the one with the most people wanting to pick it up considering it is a dark show with death and all i bet people will flock to it
anime,removed,it looks dark like a thriller but not dark like these little girls will die horrible deaths as someone whose read the novels i can tell you that that is not true the girls that die will die horrible deaths and theyre quite brutal
anime,removed,she just woke up at the school shell lend a hand in next episode
anime,removed,dude supposedly had an immortality necklace yep apparently in one of the endings of one of the games hes in he gets brutally murdered by the heroines of the game lol

anime,removed,damn loosing that last league really toke a toll on him
anime,removed,im burnin im burnin im burnin for you
anime,removed,it is not that hard as you think buddy
anime,removed,literally perfect way to describe him he kept trying to involve himself with kumiko to where he was being a nuisance and she had to tell him off
anime,removed,like regeneration or the ability to heal others or depending on the answer i answer alucard hellsing elizabeth seven deadly sins and renge non non biyori
anime,removed,well do you want to see dragons and meet igneel d
anime,removed,the isekai genre is already popular before sao came outjust look at how many web novels with the mc being hit by truckkun before being reincarnated to a fantasy world sao just repopularized the trap in a video game subgenre of isekai

anime,removed,yeah usagi drop was like a year age gap pretty weird ending too
anime,removed,aww man youve really got me there bud i do admit that scene when she confesses through their mind tap there was totally onion ninjas in the room
anime,removed,idk my hate for sakakura was so high that i felt great after his death he really deserves worse
anime,removed,watched all of them liked none of them except rezero but isnt in my top of and around in my top ever

anime,removed,jojos bizarre adventure when johnathan died

anime,removed,well
anime,removed,use kiss anime
anime,removed,its basically his introduction in the manga in the first few pages he gets chased out of a house after getting caught banging someones mom
anime,removed,i mean if this is a spoiler then the to comment of the thread would also be considered spoilers as well i can assure you that knowing or not knowing this doesnt detract from the plot in any way for those unsure of whether they want to stick the series out or not and are interested if theyll enjoy the mcs personality beyond what was shown in the first episode this is a harmless fact that just lets you know what kind of person the mc is spoiler the fact itself is provided as introductory backstory relatively soon so not even the writers consider it a spoiler since they use it as part of a characters initial description
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i care as much about spoilers as you do for series im firsttiming but i can honesty say that having already read one of the source materials knowing about this event will not affect your viewing experience as spoiler the event in question is flashback material it does not spoil any decisions characters make spoiler as it has already happened after all its the equivalent of a character saying theres actually a city north of us called such and such its purely used for world and character building and introduces us to the motivations behind certain characters and their attitudes and backgrounds the story presents this fact straightforwardly with no need of other background information about the mc not even the writers treat it as a spoiler
anime,removed,anyone else hear under pressure in the background music httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubotex
anime,removed,half the characters are holy grails
anime,removed,no torture happens but certainly going to be very intense and rather dark
anime,removed,student turns everyone in school gay httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubotex
anime,removed,my only gripe is with the setting it feels far too european almost as if someone just equated mafia italian and said make it look like italy httpsnpredditcomrcanthearyoubotex
anime,removed,when the movie was nearing its end i was crossing my fingers that shinkai didnt end the film a la cms needless to say i was very relieved
anime,removed,jotaru kujo from jojos bizarre adventure stardust crusaders
anime,removed,im just gonna tell you the worse thing isnt even someone dies rem fanboys u gonna have more pain
anime,removed,in da but
anime,removed,s desu ga
anime,removed,kill yourself you pathetic little weeb faggot
anime,removed,
anime,removed,and i really dislike your lacking taste kabaneri was shit most agree fucking deal with it
anime,removed,after watching handakun i gotta say im a tad disappointed it feels a lot like sakamoto desu ga but instead of being intentionally glorious everyone just misunderstands poor handa but this is just the first episode maybe it will get better once other main stay characters are introduced like tanakakun
anime,removed,yeah but in the end it really doesnt amount to nothing she fights some crazy guy and she loses her other shiki side
anime,removed,hmm ill have you go with for konosuba alternatively if youre up for a movie i recommend you watch
anime,removed,that matchup was so free lol
anime,removed,lol someone is getting really butthurt and defensive now as expected of a pathetic neckbeard like you who doesnt have anything better to do than develop some headcanon for his shitty anime get your annoying as fuck snobby attitude out of here thank god most people know better and dont follow your garbage take on how to watch anime
anime,removed,try kiss anime me

anime,removed,its adult saki talking
anime,removed,tomoko a cute a cuuuute i am glad we finally see how cute tomoko was which makes httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzzkdethpcea even more heartbreaking
anime,removed,i wonder if we will still get the scene where s yoshino and kotarou play with the cart also expecting seishun dee naniyaaaa next week
anime,removed,so i guess he didnt die huh
anime,removed,actually i am chinese so i read the manga before the male character zhang chulan is a very smart boy and he is really strong he couldnt show his real power right now because he has to keep the secret of his family he pretended to be really weak at the first episode he was not afraid of the zombie at all just keep watching then you can find the plot will surprise you the author of the manga made lots of foreshadowing before the climax of the manga
anime,removed,interestingly nagisa is what would happen it you rejected every other choice the game ends up being not even close and you get the bad end if tomoyo was chosen it will be easily winning match as its shown that shes good at sports tomoya will still be given the choice of taking the final choice
anime,removed,its certainly a reoccurring theme ramba ral crowley hamon bernie wiseman henken bekkner emma sheen the list just goes on and on
anime,removed,there are similar powers in tsukihime and touko aozaki is directly in fatestay
anime,removed,visual novel not the anime
anime,removed,how does mana transfer in the fate series work if the master is femake and the servant is male or if both the master and the servant are female are they just shit out of luck or would drinking love necter a la shimoneta work
anime,removed,the relationship will certainly get tangled
anime,removed,the thing about johan was you never knew about him until the end but for meruem the way he starts and the way he ends up discovering himself in the process that was really beautiful even i kinda think that he was more of an antihero
anime,removed,i thought s would be your average moefluff sol i thought s would be your average magical girl sol i thought s would be your average rom com how wrong i was
anime,removed,you missed the context of the sentence he didnt say all italia buying merchandise is autistic hes saying that japanese otakus that supported the economy of lowest common denominator shows by buying all the merchandises are probably autistic hes not insulting you
anime,removed,delicioustears i love moments like these in this series im watching s space battleship yamato they just spent the entire episode prepping a chars death with flashbacks and sentimental quotes and things that char was my favourite too then at th end the char survives
anime,removed,what are you talking about it is about cute girls doing cute things you can even ask megunee about it
anime,removed,i thought kabaneri was going to go the battlestar galactica direction and rove the country as a besieged train never able to stay in one place very long holy fuck was i wrong you might say i was off track
anime,removed,urtbingo wait
anime,removed,no
anime,removed,in my opinion we should just let this joke die like seriously we dont need to seem the same comment over and over again i would like to see some variety instead of would forget and whos rem on every single rem fanart post even though i will admit that she might not be my most liked rezero character by far ill speak out in the face of a very tired meme i know many people dont like her personality at all and i suppose that it cant be helped but still i wish that she could have a little more respect in this subreddit
anime,removed,triggered
anime,removed,how long will it take for people to get tired of this joke
anime,removed,first things first any one here fans of steven universe just me okay well anyways i have spent the last or so days binging hunter x hunter from the hunter exams to like episode my sleep has been horribly fucked up and my parents are pissed at me sitting on my ass watching anime i really need to quit anime after finishing hxh however even though i have binged so much and will probably continue to do so i would rate it the first couple of arcs has its flaws and i was severely disappointed by the resolution of s killuas kidnaping like really thats how you are going to end it damn i was so hyped for zolydck mansion dugeon raid the tournament arc wasnt even a tournament arc as they barely had any fights and only the hisoka fight was interesting the yorknew arc it was okay i dont really like kurapika as a character so it was kinda hitandmiss since kurapika was bascially the main character which is weird because he doesnt appear in the chimera ant arc oh and ah yes the chimera ant arc its overratted the beginning part felt a lot like a rip off of parasyte creature we dont understand hunting humans and maybe gaining emotions and when you factor how long this fucking fight is taking in number of episodes the fight has lasted from ep and at the point i am at it hasnt even finished yet i really dont see the hype of it so i am going to finish the anime but i will probably not read the manga it simply not worth my time
anime,removed,most stupid post on ranime my nomination is that thread where someone asked if your name has yuri commenting that it has such lgbt themes unfortunately i cant find it
anime,removed,fuck this guy like hes literally just a slimy piece of shit

anime,removed,the most emotional piece of animerelated music is the track everyone is dead all is gone all is lost that was kinda what i was feeling at the time though that is what you are supposed to feel at that point so it did its job very well i think its beautiful ti listen to maybe not sad but definitely not happy heavy and dooming
anime,removed,homura becomes the ying to madokas yang madoka was god so she became the devil honestly thats all i understood
anime,removed,around but they all have shit taste its even more painful than not having anyone
anime,removed,actually there were more imposters in the lns
anime,removed,cant really look it up since those legal piles of shit streaming websites have autistic tendency to pretend that inaccessible content does not exist but i guess crunchy has divided into parts shou ten ketsu while netflix has single long or the other way anyway content should be the same just divided differently
anime,removed,someones eager to take the bots job not satisfied wih posting all the news aye smuglancer
anime,removed,im not a manga reader but i know of truck kun will the anime allow get up to him
anime,removed,if youve read through hundred chapters of kimi no iru machi youd probably know as for fuuka ill just save the surprise for later but as a romance fan personally i dont enjoy any of seos works maybe except half half
anime,removed,they most certainly do they post news from popular twitter news sources crunchyroll and ann near instantly for the longest time this account posted chapters on rmanga while never commenting on anything it wasnt until people called him out on a certain post iirc it was for posting a chapter that the scanlator themself always posted that it started puttig generic af comments in discussion threads
anime,removed,yeah the beauty of rokka no sales™ was that every single person was suspicious as all get out so even if they were telegraphing one person about others were just as suspicious the funny thing is that according to source material s the mc ended up being the imposter all along anyway
anime,removed,episodes for chapters im betting were not going to reach the infamous chapter or well take an anime original route once were there
anime,removed,youre completely right in fact a pretty stuck up salaryman confronts god and god gets angry when he says magic miracle were not proved by science so he sends him in a world with miracle magic and no science for the bonus because the god was really pissed off hes reborn at the start of a world war in a country that really looks like mid germany
anime,removed,s the ending of jojo part
anime,removed,i kinda want to watch fuuka for the truckload of i feels i believe will have
anime,removed,s i hope they end it before truckkun makes his appearance but the concert at the budokan would be a great end too
anime,removed,you need members to start a club have they never watched anime before or something
anime,removed,it hurts me deeply knowing that tamachan is going to be shot down for fuuka should i continue knowing this self destruction or should i stop to save myself from this but i really like it so far v
anime,removed,the second half asuka and the years departure was a lot more interesting and engaging than the first half mizores autism kumiko being everywhere at the right time like a plot device didnt help
anime,removed,the second half asuka and the years departure was a lot more interesting and engaging than the first half mizores autism kumiko being everywhere at the right time like a plot device didnt help
anime,removed,so maybe he has been in a coma this whole time sounds pretty wtf
anime,removed,no mc is the hero and the bad guy is god who is actually the devil mc uses logic and efficiency to accomplish their tasks it is not their fault other people are too emotional and cant do things properly
anime,removed,debating on it but i dont want omurice with ketchup drawings on it while they go nyaa thatll make me grow a dick and get a boner annoy me since i can just make that at home
anime,removed,it felt contrived to me so some arbiters sent to judge humanity just randomly appear for reasons why how and it was a departure from the earlier themes of the show which was as you mentioned the tension between two species fighting for survival
anime,removed,come on man you can truck through it by sheer force of will
anime,removed,yeah i was a bit confused when s polnareff appeared but then i remembered that is for some reason i thought he died in because i in my mind is the most standalone of them all until

anime,removed,she gave him a goodbye kiss not an i love you kiss she pretty much put her carer before her love if she had made a promise to reunite with him after she feels she can stand on her own feet like sakurasou pet no kanojo yeah sure id buy your bs but no theres no comunication between them after the beach scene she arrives at the restaurant after years freaking years not knowing of each other theres absolutely nothing that implies they have thought of each other during that period at all she didnt even know souichi was working part time at the restaurant its just another job for her souichi didnt even react after he saw her after years and were talking about the guy that blushed for pretty much nothing and overeacted for just peanuts this is nothing more than bad ending route youre just trying to convince yourself it was a good ending

anime,removed,give it up you really have no arguments s porco fio werent a couple there was nothing but admiration for each other that was all there wasnt a confession nor any hint they were meant for each other they could part ways any day of the week without remorse seriously hineki cut souchi off for the reminder of her senior year and completely ignored him during her training in spain for the other years not even a call nor an email and you expect us to believe they can start a new after they neglected each other for so long for no real reason boy you should be writting novels with that kind of logic youll be rich with your first book

anime,removed,are u gay
anime,removed,of all the reasons to dislike sao the complete deus ex machina moment of him hacking the game from within the game is the most egregious it took a youtube video specifically pointing it out for me to realize just how bad it was
anime,removed,i post a lot so i doubt your claim is factual hence me saying any time i your flair sticks out so in a lot of episode discussion threads ive seen you as a toplevel comment talking about just that i dont really check nested comments much so you could be replying with rainbow bananas for all i know other than episode discussion threads and fanart i dont check other stuff so surprisingly i havent seen you recommending amagami ss often yuishrug actually thought amagami amethystitalian ss was your whole sn and that the flair was just colours lol
anime,removed,i was talking about dingus
anime,removed,seriously first thing that comes to mind is amagami any time i see you comment to me uamethystitalian amagami fanclub president which i am a self proclaimed member of
anime,removed,anyone who has watched this video has died to adorableness press f to pay respects
anime,removed,removing per the following report reason s spoilers i mean they did good for the first line but dummy plugs is a fairly big spoiler
anime,removed,so you guys opted out of rall for some reason even stupider honestly i think the vast majority of people would love to see this place on rall again i loved seeing what rall had to say about our occasional posts that hit there the quality of discussion in the place overall will stay the exact same the only difference would be us having fun with rall people on the occasional high scoring post
anime,removed,maybe today thats true but its half fanart sometimes
anime,removed,akg disclaimerthis is going off trying to remember this shit from years ago too many people dying for absolutely no reason the side characters start to get picked off out of the blue but for what it barely advanced the story at all they just started dropping like flies tatsumi is a man made bitch i never really understood why he was the mc at all and also why he became so close to the gay guy with the pompadour in such little time to where he inherited his abilities the final goal was what for tatsumi to take out the pm for corruption and all that jazz but try and save the town and shitat this point im already tilted as fuck from the anime one last straw and im out and i dont even think that happened accordingly someone else did not sure what happened after that but tatsumi ended dying and i immediately exited out of the episode and never finished it tokyo ghoul same disclaimer ken please ftlog why is he suck a bitch jesus fuck i understand he went through enormous trauma i really do but by x episode i expect to see development where he starts to face reality and comes to terms and iirc he doesnt and is still a whine little wimp character development please and not just for him others suffered too but for him dear lord it was bad censorship why is there so fucking much that shit was annoying as hell felt weird like a weird pace to it ended up not watching the season ive heard good things about the manga for both series however how people say its better etc but itll be a while before i pick either of them up
anime,removed,zaregato ova so you have to torrent it
anime,removed,i only read fuuka not for the truck ride but the crash

anime,removed,your lie in april s hated the whole business with kaori making kousei friend a like i understand it and i get it read many discussion threads regarding the series on this subreddit i still hate it ended the series feeling completely unfulfilled
anime,removed,plastic memories i should stop watching anime that has the main character forget everything its going to give me depression i really liked it the animation quality was great there wasnt that much fan service im looking at you eru and even though its kind of transparent read you know what is going to happen from episode i think it was really good it was never explained why exactly s giftias lose their memory after a specific time which really irritated me i wish they would make a season two especially because s michiru seemed like she had a crush on tsukasa i think she did anyway the very end kind of reminds me of angel beats overall i would give it an would recommend tldr its good they should make a second season
anime,removed,in the novels puck himself confirms that he wont be able to get past reinhard
anime,removed,especially when everyone finds out what really caused the blank letter
anime,removed,so she doesnt die wow spoiler
anime,removed,i just finished assassination classroom yesterday and all i can say is that it really was very very nice every character was more or less welldeveloped s i cried my heart out koro sensei oh why i also did watch steinsgate and i loved it as much as i love assassination classroom and code geass meaning i absolutely loved them as a person whos really interested in sciency stuff steinsgate really struck a chord and admittedly made me shed some tears s i wonder if the woman at the end of the last episode would be darus wife
anime,removed,im currently going through madoka and i don really care about anything that happens i dont trust kyuubey at all i didnt care about mami dieing because she was even barely in the show and everyone is so stupid for even wanting to be a magic girl except for bluehair i am going to keep watching though because apparently it gets better though
anime,removed,nagi no asukara the art was gorgeous and the soundtrack was amazing but i didnt like the plot at all and didnt understand why everyone else who watched it described it as a tragic or deep masterpiece all the character conflicts could have been resolved if they took a minute or so to talk it over you would think that after the time skip they would have matured a bit and got over it i thought it was unrealistic how emotional the characters were and how they started crying about every little thing manakas constant crying was annoying as well and i didnt like how her sensitiveness was always portrayed in a cute endearing way i dont mind crybaby characters if they have a reasonable background for it like shinji or are comic relief like jacuzzi but when its supposed to be a moe thing its just obnoxious the discrimination of sea people by the land people was never really explained either and i didnt find it very logical i totally dug the idea of an underwater city though unfortunately they didnt take the chance to explore the history and nature of it in more depth which is unfortunate because the scenery was absolutely beautiful
anime,removed,it counts for me i was just looking for new illegal sites to illegally download anime and stuff
anime,removed,pm more illegal sites legal is crap
anime,removed,neko
anime,removed,it was sick man especially the episode where the student council murder each other rocks m
anime,removed,was going to say id like to swap with subaru from rezero just for rem but then id have to die and see people die and have people forget the stuff weve done together constantly maybe yuuta from chuunibyou is a better choice because rikka is cute even if she is delusional
anime,removed,anime sux
anime,removed,okay obvious spoilers but the vampires in shiki win in the end kinda since they are still alive and kicking they may not be super bad ass but the show is amazing
anime,removed,homura did nothing wrong
anime,removed,yeah it is clearly superspecialawesome s in a few hours the sun will rise
anime,removed,more as in entire chapter about those two read and feel the pain of not getting this enhanced by glorious doga kobo animation
anime,removed,its just to make you cry later s when you find that rems existence has been erased before that save point
anime,removed,my theory is that when mob goes next episode reigen will calm him down and absorb some of his energy unintentionally giving him full control of mobs abilities
anime,removed,manga reader here dont worry dude itll be fine
anime,removed,chuckled reading this because im sure youre not the only thinking the sentiment looking forward to everyones reactions next week
anime,removed,fg
anime,removed,i second with the final battle vs the centurion
anime,removed,what how in the hell did reigen dupe all of those people his con powers are op
anime,removed,s ive forgotten what happens at the end of the place promised in our early days but i wouldnt say its bittersweet like per second per second is a more depressing bittersweet compared to kimi no na wa
anime,removed,not exactly an extra boost but the last episode of katanagatari has the main character not holding back and using the full extent of his power for basically the first time in the entire series and its amazing
anime,removed,shhhh guys shhhh
anime,removed,s he is the actual boss lots of hints were dropped but very discrete
anime,removed,im an anime only viewer i totally expect reigen to bluff his way in like that do the scars know what their bosses look like
anime,removed,s that scene is very important and i will never say it isnt its the first time we clearly see that haruhi will listen to kyon and go along with him to make him happier
anime,removed,i was leaning on the side that reigen is conartisting the shit out of the claw group but now that ive read the early chapters of the manga im httpsimgurcomaoncgz bricks
anime,removed,looks more like a nod to the scene from the movie where shes showering and suzuha gets into the room
anime,removed,s
anime,removed,because isnt a single person
anime,removed,when the titular tengen toppa gurren lagann appear
anime,removed,i prefer when satou tries to kill himself that was hilarious
anime,removed,well you just spoiled it for me i was still convinced he was bluffing
anime,removed,this is some crazy stuff rifjwkwkw
anime,removed,dude im hype as shit for this album
anime,removed,thats not true if you read the wn
anime,removed,imo hes still able to do so because it is stated that he is a human close to be a vampire but still a human the main problem is whether he could lose that due to the consecutive use of his powers though that may be solved in the last volume of owarimonogatari
anime,removed,rape rape and ntr thats some uh interesting taste there
anime,removed,cant wait to get depressed again by this in anime form

anime,removed,your lie in april has no real story and rely too much on cliche plot like dying main character the comedy isnt any different than typical haremecchi anime rezero is just steins gate wannabe which main story is putting repetitive cliffhangers and melodramatic scene to attract cheap spectator fmab is a generic shounen with some cheap philoshopy doesnt deserve top series place at mal gintama is overrated berserks manga has become so repetitive their reader is mostly just old kid with nostalgic attraction death note is the most pretentious anime ever l has no real personality the story became shithole since near appear mirai nikki and elfen lied was made by edgy teen who think adding blood to their anime is so dark n cool kimi no na wa is just average

anime,removed,manga is far ahead of the show there are some hints in the show but not to the level of the full out confession that happened in the manga a few week ago
anime,removed,ive never seen this mentioned but the scene in hxh at the end of the chimera ant arc with the mother from the ngr village reuniting with her daughter that whole little plot point was so subtlety weaved into the rest of the arc that when i saw that scene i couldnt help but tear up just a little togashi really is the only author to ever make me care for a minor character in a shounen series
anime,removed,i love emilia
anime,removed,the ending was a disappointment after everything that happened the ending was still nauseatingly happy
anime,removed,heres some basic stuff about his life post fz across the various timelines of the nasuverse s he returns to the association to study and takes over the title of el melloi to become el melloi ii dont leave off the second he really hates that he develops a strange love hate relationship with japan like giving rin shit for being japanese but also turning archibalds volumen hydrargyrum into a moe as fuck maid he stays at the academy mostly being involved somewhat in pretty much any story that goes there during his time period he has a cameo at the start of fateapocrypha for example though he most notable is probably his appearance in the fsn ubw epilogue which was written especially for the anime finally in the ubw timeline he and rin team up and battle other mages in an attempt to destroy the greater grail for good a war which is described to have been in he same scope as a holy grail war if you really want more check out el melloi ii case files a light novel written about him specifically

anime,removed,damn it i dont know enough moonrunes to decipher it
anime,removed,basically last episode of cowboy bebop then
anime,removed,while i agree the mcs genius is a bit contrived at times your example actually had a good explanation s the pilots dont control every part of their mecha directly they mostly execute programs taking care of the finer points aside from small improvements making new programs was extremely difficult and even the mc struggled in pulling it off it took two of the best pilots to control a single centaur mecha the way the two of them controlled it would then be recorded and converted to programs normal pilots might eventually be able to use in the future the shouldermounted arms were less complex but still required extensive modification of existing programs and required power that simply wasnt available to their previous designs honestly the technobabble is pretty solid and consistent in this series the mc is definitely excessively good at his job but i dont agree that its because the other people are idiots s the one exception being his needing to introduce keys to mechas so their enemies dont just get to steal them
anime,removed,kyubey is a pretty great villain tho
anime,removed,rem whos rem
anime,removed,please give me a torrent with subs ty
anime,removed,madoka is a great example of a tragic story if you dont like tragedys or are just turned off by the genre then you wont like the show its really not a show for everyone

anime,removed,okay sure we can be friends s after i get what i was promised♡♡
anime,removed,my kizumonogatari ln just came in from the mail and im very impressed by the translation so far i can see that they did their best but i dont know yet if thats enough to fare against the bakatsuki tl that i read years ago i just caught up with mob pscyho after putting it off for the past weeks this series is such a fucking roller coaster of emotions i do and dont want to watch the next episode it sucks seeing a kid unwillingly go through shit like that it couldve been worse if reigen wasnt with him but still
anime,removed,only cucks would enjoy this show
anime,removed,i finished ie naki ko remi and the specials i really liked it it was a quality show with lots of good points i like most of the wmt shows and this didnt let me down at all actually what its most similar to is the nonwmt show kemono no souja erin which is one of my alltime favorite shows not only is erin and remi similar but the developmentwriting and seriousness in the plot the type of show where most things events and choices have a consequence i love these shows as they feel realistic and its very easy to buy into the story and the characters which ultimately makes all the powerful and important scenes much more impactful in the end of the day erin does everything remi does just a bit better but remi is still a really great show i enjoyed remi herself was fantastic just the kind of mc i like in this type of show the strong willed positive and energetic personality was a joy to watch especially as she felt so real with how different events impacted her and made her feel vitalis was also a great character most of his words carried meaning but he never came across as the morally perfect kind of guy that can get annoying his teachings to remi was grounded in reality and lifted by relevance from recent events his travels with remi and the animals until the halfway point in the show was my favorite part as there was this harmonious and interesting air around how the of them met and lived their everyday life the episodic nature of the first third was really great and i loved it remi and vitalis visiting a town encountering different characters and issues working hard to deal with them and the payoff at the end of the episodes as often they were heartwarming i really liked this setup and i wanted more of that while we watched remi grow and develop so when we met the halfway point and onwards i didnt like the show quite as much as i did in the earlier parts s when vitalis eventually couldnt hold on to life anymore and died it was a really sad moment with great impact on me personally i had been waiting for it as it was very clearly written in the stars how it would end up for him but it didnt lose any impact for that reason however from this point and on i didnt quite enjoy the show as much as until this point there was a long chain of episodes with remi at gaspards place which turned into the sole purpose of the episodes as she got used to her new home what bothered me was the extent of gaspards violent abuse especially towards the youngest childs its just hard to watch i dont know gaspard was an evilminded business man and some of his tactics and use of violence just didnt make sense at all even from his business point of view it all came along and turned out great though as when the characters glued together there was some great scenes and plot developments as well as character developments the last quarter of the show including the specials was pretty great and by the end i sat with a good feeling after watching this show even though some of chasing and nearmissfind could feel a bit dragged at times a great show i will recommend to others and i want to thank you for the contract

anime,removed,aka stand users attract other stand users crap he knows too much time to deal with him
anime,removed,not the strongest episode since majority of the dialogue was used in before the filler arc started but the animation and more eyebrows was enough for me to not get annoyed i like how the op foreshadows some conflict that will happen between the brothers and some of it was already shown in the episode
anime,removed,yeah but that is reasonable kind of you grow blind in one eye you get to do it twice
anime,removed,not ever uchiha unlocked the mangekyou sharingan which enables most of those from the wiki is an advanced form of the sharingan that has only been activated by a handful of uchihathe mangekyō grants powerful abilities that differ from user to user though abilities may be similar in nature it is initially awakened by the trauma suffered from witnessing the death of someone close to the user uchiha have historically misunderstood this criteria as the user needing to be responsible for the persons death and for that reason they developed the practice of killing their closest friends in order to gain the mangekyō sharingan
anime,removed,so why does that rem joke get the mods so bent out of shape do they hate comedy

anime,removed,notable characters for me emiya kiritsugu one of the best executed antiheroes i think hell go far saber maybe a one dimensional character of sorts but still has a great motivation lucyelfein lied one incredibly messed up and tragic character gon frecess presented as an innocent child but as hunter x hunter develops he clearly is a s psychopath of sorts killua zoldyk the child assassin s although a heartless murderer at times in the beginning after freeing himself from illumis influence he showed his natural kindness linyao what makes a great leader linyao clashes with s wrath in a battle of ideologies there nanami yasuri the humanweapons sister s so dangerous her own body cant handle it and her special power is to become weak enough to give other opponents a chance

anime,removed,s sakurakosan
anime,removed,its one of the most prominent things imo the faces often look really disformed sometimes and the cgi armies look terrible to me but i was willing to forgive it considering animating multiple armies in the thousands would be too time consuming and expensive i get what you mean but from what i remember of the shows the battles were great to me especially daryun vs that massive dude and daryun vs silver mask s i agree with your comment on daryun always whooping ass same with narsus always outsmarting their opponents with his seemlingly unlimited omnipotence although i think the show did a good job showing how daryun isnt invincible in the fights mentioned above

anime,removed,i have read the novels you are correct oh dear god are you correct this is a fucked up battle royal survival story nothing like madoka
anime,removed,i think saying that there were solid ideas is giving them too much credit the storyboard is the biggest mess possible just take inori for instance an artificially created high school pop star guerilla revolutionary incarnate of the main characters forgotten godlike dead sister execution becomes a nonfactor once youve built up the most convoluted story possible

anime,removed,those death charts were the best but in the end no one died
anime,removed,sg some conspiracy theorist dumb fuck tries making a time machine and when he messes up he has to save his retarded girl friend over and over
anime,removed,uimasxypancake finished i wanted to watch this for a while the art style looks interesting and the character designs are really refreshing it kind of remembers me of jojos unique art style only that the for katanagatari the character designs are unique one thing that put me off before was that i heard it lacked action it was good the action scenes were really short but they felt good i feel like they could have put more attention on them though the whole show i felt like whenever a good music starts playing something good is going to happen s togame fell in love with him after all and in the end i think she tried making him forget about her and all that talk that he went there to die i think it was in a simbolistic way like how togame died mentally in the past i really wanted shichiki to end together with togame also the whole scene of her dying i was thinking kiss kiss kiss one last time but i think they didnt because togame wanted to make him forget also that rampage through all the swords at the castle felt so good and so satisfying especially the emonzaemon fight also hitei with shichiki ewww i really didnt like that they talked too much well that gave all characters some depth but it isnt something i am used to all in all good and bad it felt really refreshing as an action anime and i think it would fit as my favorite anime out of
anime,removed,tatami galaxy repeats itself eleven times
anime,removed,where can i watch this
anime,removed,i was hoping one or more character would get eaten by a bear or otherwise brutally murdered i read somewhere that all the characters survived the entire show and that is a great travesty
anime,removed,you forgot to specify a rock made of murder
anime,removed,crippled midget and his brother searches for a rock made of genocide
anime,removed,yeah but her ova doesnt do her route justice at all tomoyos ova is good because they were able to slip some of her scenes into the main show however the entire ryoukyou route revolves around the romantic elements so they werent able to adapt some of it into the show like with tomoyos so from what i remember the kyou ova is pretty much just the end of the route without any of the buildup
anime,removed,was really hoping fuuko was younger technically shes the same age as tomoya but she looks younger because shes taking on her appearance when she got in the accident
anime,removed,nagisa wouldnt survive watching this anime never have truer words been spoken
anime,removed,he was a grown man by the end tho
anime,removed,you keep telling yourself that kidnapping surgically altering and torturing innocent kids can be done with undoubtedly good intentions also no one is tortured anywhere in the series pain was used as a deterrent for lying at times thats all they werent going to actually injure any of them so youre in the enhanced interrogation tactics camp i take it mccain would be proud
anime,removed,youre either incredibly generous with your ratings or you have truly shit tastes
anime,removed,ansatsu kyoushitsu assassination classroom well fuck me im horrible with the original names and the only reason as to why i remember black butlers name is because most people said it was shit and the name is kuroshitsuji real mature i know so i kind of saw the ansatsu kyoushitsu part and just assumed it was bb i actually like assassination classroom for the same reason that i liked seven deadly sins minus the action part its lighthearted and i watched it after watching a bunch of dark shows so it was a welcome break form the edge waiting on season to take another break from dark stuff though
anime,removed,koe no katachi english sub leaked
anime,removed,i think its a prequels mayu was a salty ass ho in season maybe lostorage is the story why her sick games got worse maybe at the end chi and suzu will win and get them coins avoiding more despair someone commented that coin system seems tame compared to eternal bitch system

anime,removed,i will answer here but next time go to rrezero to continue the story first you read this then you continue here the manga has some things that the anime skipped like this also you can read the beginning of arc here httpskagurojpwordpresscom the anime skipped things especially from the arc beginning
anime,removed,as i thought the anime does have its dark or suspicious lack of better word moments like the one last week where hina was almost approached by those kids if im going to be honest i genuinely dont believe a male being raped can be taken seriouslyby myself and i assume most males at least on the internet and i despise the other kind of rape i guess that makes me sexist i dont give a sh though all in all this anime is simply nice to watch keeps me entertained all the way through this episode was cute hina and akari are cute
anime,removed,the greateat hype the ultimate lies it was one of the best and heaviest manga series ive ever seen some of the fights were absolutely jaw dropping the emotion and drama were top notch watching these characters go from normal to accepting what is coming as well as what they must do was heartbreaking in some scenes they obviously ran out of money halfway through and cut most of the important parts in the op theres a scene where the kid is freaking out at all the stars that is not in the series spoilers ahead in the manga the giant robot can detect life they must go to an alternate universe and kill the pilots of the other universes robot the life detection actually comes as a plot point and method they use to snipe another robot through the planet the scene in question was around the end of the series where it looks like the other robot pilots are giving up and instead of killing them the nice guy lets them give up they teleport away figuring their world is dead anyway why not bring the mcs world with them so now the only way the nice guy can save his world is by methodically killing every man woman and child on the planet which those stars represent each one a person theres an amazing scene that follows where he begins firing the lasers and wiping out all life and this takes hours we watch him cry puke and basically have a complete psychological breakdown as he kills everyone one by one they fucking cut this scene

anime,removed,please be nice i am a bot so plese forgive me if i make any errors
anime,removed,yes homura totally overshadowed kyoko which is a shame imo s in contrast to homura who through her actions made everything worse and worse kyoko gave her life just to put sayaka to rest homura at least in part couldnt give up past a certain point because the stakes had gotten so high while kyoko didnt even know sayaka for very long

anime,removed,throughout the whole show they tell you that the mystery person has to be a student then at the last they pull the rug out from under you and make it the teacher how can you have a good mystery for the viewers when youre not even giving them a proper chance to solve it sure looking back there was clues but the show demands that you only look at the students

anime,removed,spoilers
anime,removed,watched it on anilinkz gogoanime doesnt seem to have it yet
anime,removed,alex is understandable he is a very fun character and he does a lot in his own show but hughes he is just kind of there for the first few episodes and then when he days you get sad a bit and thats it
anime,removed,download it illegally off the internet
anime,removed,sankarea the final episode tied things together but we never got to see the anime climax to her finally decaying erased alot of people will disagree with me on this one but that last episode just didnt seem right to me he became a successful manga artist and everything comes together but we never get to see if things between him and the pizza girl escalate but thats just my opinion akame ga kill this is one of my favorite animes but the ending was just horrible and we deserve a second season ive heard there will be a reboot of the anime soon but it was talked about over a year ago
anime,removed,its not anime yet but in the manga for my hero academia deku vs muscular im not gonna spoil anything but that fight is a fucking feel trip those whove read it will know what im talking about
anime,removed,its hard to explain one thing that annoys me is how they have the same facial expression like of the time lots of the character deaths could have easily been avoided and i feel like they only died because plot needed them to so i didnt really feel any connection with the characters and their death the whole barrier witch thing was pretty cool bit confusing at first but the barriers are honestly the only thing that i liked about the show so far and the soundtrack that plays with the barrier like i honestly cant see why this show gets the praise that it does
anime,removed,parasyte spoilers when migi sacrificed itself for shinichi i got some heavy feels parasyte has a ton of those moments
anime,removed,that man does not watch anime he makes them also he fucking hates modern anime and the wind rises was a huge middle finger toward everything
anime,removed,i am a bot on behalf of reddit i would like to thank you for your honesty we live in harried times honesty is in short supply thats why when you go out of your way to assure the reddit community that your comment is honest i honestlybot have made it my mission to thank you
anime,removed,do we follow the character that smokes as the one that has the most screen time isnt king arthur a female in this lol
anime,removed,what lol anime tends to be sexist as fuck pokes fun at disabilities and over sexualizes little girls among many other things western comics parallels some those things in many ways sure some shit is political but when you got dudes sodomizing other dudes with a jack hammer who fucking cares about political undertones
anime,removed,its stated s archercame from fate route where s shirou won the grail war but he didnt s romance saber aka save her soul
anime,removed,we need another hiroshima
anime,removed,the overly cutesy shit is cringy not that the autismos here would notice
anime,removed,but puck heals him with his buttdust i guess in that case the anime leaves out the reason they stay together completely
anime,removed,when does the first season end i never watched the anime but i read the manga to the contest where megumin just won a match and a hamburger battle with arato just started
anime,removed,heh s
anime,removed,puck was fine until miura put him into chibi mode
anime,removed,well his greninja has a transformation that no other greninja can achieve it was also leaked that ash will reach the finals and its been hinted that hell win a few times but cant be sure as of yet
anime,removed,well im a pokemon fan but i only watch the gym battlesleague because the rest is pretty much filler it has also been leaked that ash will reach the final so this season has a lot of potential to end up with ash winning
anime,removed,well we know that hes against alain in the finals so no tobias ash lost both times in their recent battles so that seems like an obvious flag that hell win
anime,removed,if you think its bad in the west you should see the insanity that is japanese bluray pricing
anime,removed,s its explained later on that its not i dont think thats spoilerish enough to warrant a black box but i wont take chances it doesnt ruin anything so go ahead and look at it
anime,removed,im a manga reader and the reason shes best girl is not for her appearance but i have to agree with you on that point
anime,removed,things that cant be done in any shape or form in any way he literally sends someone flying backwards for no reason whatsoever with heavens door
anime,removed,s hishiro is actually
anime,removed,i feel bad the people who dont know whats going to happen to rem
anime,removed,it came out in and the animated adaptation was a huge letdown we were disappointed yet again when peter jackson butchered it beyond belief skipping content is different to butchering and changing it all berserk fans are lucky
anime,removed,were not allowed to say but if you search watch berserk online you can probably find it
anime,removed,i was pretty happy to at least get to see schierke i wonder if all the rush is because they wanna take this all the way to the berserker armor
anime,removed,give me diogio gios mudamudamudamuda over kenshiro and jotaro

anime,removed,well they do stream in now so thats a plus i personally like them as much as central and more than commie but the big reason i use it is for conveniences sake i dont like running a big black unaesthetic hdmi cable all the way across my apartment from my desk to the tv its convenient to be able to stream directly from my i would say good on you if you want to invest but if you dont youre not really losing anything except for some mild convenience
anime,removed,jesus christ the drama in relife is just really stupid and absurd i just watched ep and wanted to punch my screen because of karui and during that episode ive found what i hate the most and thats highschool drama conflicts but i did enjoy amagami ss tho
anime,removed,personally the only way it could be more authentic was if there was a bullet hole in her chest
anime,removed,ehh idk in theory being able to emulate everyones basketball keikei genkai is pretty insane even if its only for five minutes and he was one of the top players for the vorpal swords in extra game imo
anime,removed,eh there are fan theories like that behind shiro and touma doesnt really change about how things are executed thanks for the theory but im not picking it up sounds boring and forced
anime,removed,in regards to relife that episode was spoiler
anime,removed,it is about people trying to make themselves taller
anime,removed,i think hughess death was sadder tbh i loved that dude
anime,removed,ryo is actually hishiros supporter and an is aratas i mean it would make sense if an were a supporter seeing as shes posed right next to ryo in the scene in the opening where they climb up the hill
anime,removed,can we just say everything after ls death why waste all that time wouldve been such a better ending
anime,removed,well this hasnt happened yet in the anime yet so wouldntwouldnt this be spoilers
anime,removed,tbh its best they didnt show it if thats the case it will only lead to a bigger upset later on lol
anime,removed,last night i finished otorimonogatari nadeko medusa and was over excited to see what will happen later in the series that trailer argh then i watched onimonogatari shinobu time s i bit your tongue dekocry
anime,removed,the next episode is where arc really becomes sadistic a good bit of people drop the ln because of how unfair it is its not bad its actually really good but holy shit does it hurt
anime,removed,kagari is too kawaii
anime,removed,it is basically just told us souma megumi aint happening
anime,removed,what i loved shizurus tree route
anime,removed,try yotsuba its from a genera called slice of life and this one is about a little girl and her single dad moving to a new town and the shenanigans they get into you can check it out here
anime,removed,when i rewatch nana i stop at episode i pretend that hachi didnt make her horrible decision that comes afterwards and whats the point of watching the rest of the episodes where the girls arent even interacting
anime,removed,ye they gave way too much spotlight to characters who are irrelevant to this arc there was no reason why nikumi and erina should be in there so much on top of that they reused shots from last season and sspoiled the final match up
anime,removed,edit also with the she doesnt cook with her heart but with her brain setup it was obvious that she would lose against soma though honestly its pretty obvious that soma will win in the end s if you believe its obvious that souma will win in the end youre going to have a bad time
anime,removed,rewrite has a sort ofsupernatural setting in a way yet supernatural isnt the correct term because things arent actuallywell nvm in any case the anime is confirmed to be a kagari route
anime,removed,well considering hes actually a s year old superhuman soldier with the memories and body of a high schooler it would be weird if you didnt find him uncomfortable why do you think his body can do all that crazy flipping stuff
anime,removed,i personally have used for downloads for crunchyroll simply put the video link into its search bar and itll allow you to download the video to your computer complete with built in subs its usually only in the lowest resolution available though but if you just want to watch videos you already can legally watch but cant watch on the go because of the drain on data its good enough for phones fair warning though last time i tried downloading from crunchyroll had some problems with it that was a month ago or so though so hopefully it works again now
anime,removed,i really hope its not related to what nagisa and ushio had
anime,removed,well we download anime by being pirates torrents are most common mean of getting stuff i will pm you a list of trackers i hope i didnt break the rule
anime,removed,please edit your spoiler tag to say the spoiler references the ln
anime,removed,is this show good is it gay like free
anime,removed,i know a certain kyoani show that is guilty of the first one coughcough s chunnibyo season
anime,removed,lolimaster is an account controlled by one of the other mods this discussion was had in a past thread some of us like having it around and the rest of us dont care its well secured so it doesnt provide risk of ato or anything
anime,removed,i know this isnt very related to the thread what is the drama about love the fan art btw and that music video was beautiful
anime,removed,pretty sure in ubw anime that it did show something inside him in full form in fatezero it showed it in the mage killer
anime,removed,there is one thing that l always look for when watchread review that is the meaning of event in the show reviewers often give judgement not explanation ghost in the shell tackles the theme of human identity in a very thought provocative way it is worth watching no ive already watched it and i seek a review to understand it better not to convince myself that liking it is the right thing to do i want to know why the author let major merges with the puppet master who is the emerged identity and what the author is trying to tell us biba is an onedimensional character and ruined kabanaeri no i expect reviewer to explain what bibas personality and motive is before telling me why biba sucks in a nutshell i hope to hear the perspective of someone who understand the shows and can help me understand it better not someone who present me with a check list of goodbad quality
anime,removed,mild show spoilers ahead it was worth a watch imo i tend to drop a decent amount of shows that i start watching but despite the shit cgi at times i found it overall an enjoyable show some of the action scenes werent great but it hit the horror elements perfectly imo rape horse was creepy as fuck and mozgus torture chamber was nightmare fuel i also really liked how they handled the egg of the perfect world and his story and seeing the skeleton knight animated was badass im not a manga reader if that says anything so at this point i was just happy to see guts story continue even if it was only for episodes
anime,removed,i did actually see this shortly after it hit gogoanime and it seemed kind of like what mememe and girl were supposed to an anime music video with a sort of deeper meaning and all that though i do agree that this was really pleasant to watch and listen to
anime,removed,because i didnt know it existed being that im not a rabid fan of all things anime i use gogoanime for most animes i watch and for anything new if i see something new i read the synopsis watch the first episode then move on if its not something i care about or i binge the shit out of it or wait anxiously for every new episode like a crack addict in this case it popped up i clicked it the premise seemed boring yet still intriguing contradictory i know so i watched it and here we are
anime,removed,whatever creep
anime,removed,no it wasnt this is creepy af
anime,removed,keep deflecting i could not care less you need psychological help shameful weeb
anime,removed,keep telling yourself that pederast
anime,removed,as expected a bunch of pathetic weeb downvoting a different opinion drink bleach and fuck you all you fat ugly neckbeard troglodytes bunch of losers you all are cant even have a simple discussion
anime,removed,cant wait to see karasuno beat shiratorizawa it is one hell of a final game
anime,removed,removed by nazi mods for not being an anime s
anime,removed,fuck the ranime mods
anime,removed,i love emilia
anime,removed,httpswwwredditcomrdirtymindbots hi there
anime,removed,they also had a different episode title near the end i think that episode will probably not have mio because minutes an average for the episodes not counting the op ed and the next chapter preview doesnt seem to be enough to show both miyata nozomi and mios matches dont forget the part where ujibe talks to nozomi after her match
anime,removed,and someone named rem that loves him
anime,removed,code pls all are taken
anime,removed,wow okay yeah fuck the ranime mods that spongebob comparison you can fuck the fuck right off mods
anime,removed,basically every couple with a tsundere except tors adoras
anime,removed,while i see this could you edit that tag one more time to include the name of the show explicitly its obvious from the thread but its still a requirement for all spoiler tags to include the title of their source
anime,removed,the aria one where where they go to the hot spring thats in an old rundown churchlike building the one where s alice gets a double promotion is also top notch
anime,removed,can we address the issue thats on everyones mind mainly the removal of the shelter video and what constitutes an anime on this sub obviously its bad that the mods got death threats over it but to use that as an excuse to direct some kind of fault to the sub as a whole is incredibly immature and unwarranted i think there should be some kind of apology for how this situation was handled additionally there is probably no better time to bring back the discussion of what constitutes an anime really obviously the definition an animated series produced and aired in japan intended for a japanese audience is far too limiting but the line still has to be drawn somewhere opinions
anime,removed,not really much later on in the show theres a girl with power relies on her boob its just that theres not so much you can train for boobs so its kind of neglected in the training arc
anime,removed,thats piracy oniichan at least its fitting for the show i guess
anime,removed,never actually used it before so i wouldnt knew but is assume that you can watch it on funimation but there are other more ways to watch it
anime,removed,if fucking mumen rider beats kageyama in the next round this sub should just shut down
anime,removed,also more female mods yes please our takeover takes another step forward good job ladies especially if they help spread the gospel of shoujo and josei on that one
anime,removed,im always hunting for more sukitte fanatics
anime,removed,your lie in april sounds like a good bet for you centered around music with romance and comedic elements
anime,removed,i think danganronpa was amazing its gave us so much more information in the danganronpa universe its really nice and satisfying to see the danganronpa crew before they got mad and how junko plotted everything i think its near perfect when it comes to a sequel to the earlier danganronpa games
anime,removed,
anime,removed,fuuka will still be a truckload of fun
anime,removed,thats because madoka is not part of the good shows easy
anime,removed,if you want to listen to some of the songs i have majority of them you can listen to d for everyone else theyre so you can drag and drop them into an itunes album and sync them to your phone
anime,removed,well said friend

anime,removed,actually she and fsn saber are technically different people in this case and have had different development to each other
anime,removed,thats what he said at the end of it all i highly doubt he woke up one morning and went im going to trap people in a virtual world because i forgot and proceeded to do it dae sao is shit tho rite
anime,removed,so much effort and at the end of the day my opinion on traps will not change
anime,removed,her older sister is way better
anime,removed,doesnt spoil anything untag it
anime,removed,done
anime,removed,first time watching fuuka i dont read manga hmm can yuuka like die or something i dont want her in the way i dont believe you
anime,removed,cdjapan is usually a good one just search for the show and you might find one illegally you can usually download them by googling anime ost and finding one of those websites with a mega link you can also find them on nyaa but usually you need to typecopypaste the show name in japanese to find it
anime,removed,ayylmao totally not shitpost e til squarepants copletely covers broken comment face
anime,removed,coming from the autist i think that means something
anime,removed,sail the high seas but itll only be

anime,removed,the episode where netero literally blew himself
anime,removed,if theyre not available then perhaps its time to visit a certain place which some may describe as horrible
anime,removed,because its just so silly did the title trigger you
anime,removed,is it s usagi drop
anime,removed,s kill la kill
anime,removed,kamina in gurren laagan
anime,removed,horriblesubs their website says that they dont rip subs from other places is this not true
anime,removed,what people actually use crunchyroll i remember when it first released everyone laughed their asses off at the idea quality is poor too grab a torrent program and go to nya or bakabt
anime,removed,is subscribing to crunchyroll worth my cad is it better than kissanime
anime,removed,no no no sure the main character and her best friend live together sleep in the same bed and adopt and raise a little girl that calls both of them mama but theyre totally straight
anime,removed,and now i watch horriblesubs karma gentleman
anime,removed,hey there i suggest editing the free site out of that comment or a mod might remove it because it breaks this rule do not link tolead people towards torrents proxies or unofficial streamsdownloads also there is a chrome extension that bypasses the crunchyroll region block its called crunchyroll unblocker
anime,removed,one of the main themes was stepping aside for the new generation he knew his time had passed
anime,removed,if anyone needs anime please hit up my sites httpwwwanimekenscom
anime,removed,soundcloud usually has just about anything you want
anime,removed,if itunes doesnt have it for legit download outside of japan which youd be lucky to find if it does and youtube doesnt have a version i can convert i usually turn to that has all sorts of music
anime,removed,
anime,removed,the only solace we can get from homuras mini time loop hell is the tamura homura manga spin offs easily the funniest madoka related thing i have ever read
anime,removed,i would prefer the anime to be this way too and i think that it would be doable nozomis match with kotone could be splitted into eps and in theory maybe the reason for the change was because the other two matches werent as long and as a result not as interesting so people could complain about these matches being anticlimatic or about aoba giving up too early after losing if the animes pacing is too fast
anime,removed,bishamon from noragami s although she does become an ally eventually s nadeko sengoku
anime,removed,sword art online ii and yhe whole zekken hasdies from aids thing i dont watch this shit for deep emotional bullshit i watch because i wanted to see you clear aincrad you fucks
anime,removed,yes its the closest one that exists even it though was careful not to ever openly acknowledge the relationship or use any concrete words or show any kind of follow up it was still told through hints their kiss was back pedaled somewhat by describing it as a goodbye kiss it was very very good and very very obvious but still not quite a straightforward depiction if you see what i mean shinsekai yori also depicted nonstraight couples even intimacy between them but it too backpedals on it by the end of the series so there are exceptions for sure but there still isnt a single mainstream anime where a character is allowed to be openly and unapologetically gay maybe this one will change that but itd be unlikely
anime,removed,its an intentionally shitty anime
anime,removed,i love emilia
anime,removed,but catboys rem catboys
anime,removed,anilinkzcom you can also look into a program called kodi very freaking nice they have an app too
anime,removed,crunchyroll next in line is a site that rhymes with pissanime
anime,removed,yes for starters its not a depressing ending
anime,removed,as it lets me fully appreciate art and animation and catch things that i might otherwise miss are you disabled you arent missing anything when watching subbed anime or you are lying to defend the fact that you are willingly eating shit
anime,removed,nah just slaughter
anime,removed,it reminds me a lot of s with what appears to be a utopic world being presented in an increasingly disturbing light with it gradually becoming clear that children were being killed off and memories selectively erased to maintain that secrecy i really hope it follows a similar route as ssys season slowly peeling back a neverperfect bright facade
anime,removed,he hasnt he got quite burned in the last one you can even say he got blast burned
anime,removed,honestly pretyt disappointed everything seemed to going in the right direction last season beautiful battle animation ash looks older strong enough team to actually win a league and he should have but now all of that seems to be going in the opposite direction maybe they werent happy with the views last season and wanted to change things up
anime,removed,kumiko i love you reina i love s emiliasensei
anime,removed,this is the same ash that got top in kalos
anime,removed,for me its probably one of the first scenes in the negima anime final movie when fate just dies for no reason seriously what the hell one of the reasons i was looking forward to that was getting see more of fate and his interactions with negi kotaro and the rest of the class but nope he just dies at the very beginning of the movie
anime,removed,
anime,removed,and not a single soul was executed biggest betrayal in anime history
anime,removed,death note i thought l would be using it and light yagami would be just a friend i was so wrong
anime,removed,spoiler ahead that moment in higurashi when that greenhaired girl sorry forgot her name had to remove her fingernails with that weird machinethinking about it still freaks me out xx also that scene in another where that girl freaked out and ran down the hall with her umbrellawhen she arrived at the stairs i was like omg d and yea corpse partyjust so much gore
anime,removed,thank got kamina died later on
anime,removed,and kamina had the boner of his lifetime in his grave
anime,removed,well last episode he did mention hes heading back to kanto
anime,removed,suzaku from the stereotypical angle is the white knight of justice in code geass however perhaps due to how he was written his motives or a deconstruction of the trope he actually becomes the complete opposite an pretentious foolish downright evil little shit another is sayaka miki from madoka who is a much better example of this ie shes actually a good person even if it doesnt go well for her in the end
anime,removed,anybody know a good anime with the feel of aot like a feel like the first episode when you see his mom get eaten the atmosphere his reaction everything gave me chills and goosebumps anything else like that like adrenaline boosters thanks

anime,removed,fukkiretainthepussy
anime,removed,i retract my original statement your point is all too valid i posted this before watching the episode and i now see another way anyways first of all s im sure that that giant black thing is the embodiment of an imperfect grail
anime,removed,the scene wasnt really made meaningful in the series but it was really satisfying for me robin snapping spandams spine in one piece

anime,removed,oh yeaaah girlfriend x it sure brings up memories
anime,removed,a lot of people are telling you how important it is to play or watch the second game but i can give a brief summary so you wont be as confused all the classmates in the despair arc are called the remnants of despair they were junkos underlings basically anyways i wont spoil whatll most likely happen in this despair arc but what i will say is what happened after junko died after she died the remnants carried out her will but then nagi who joined the future foundation that you can see in the new anime put them in a virtual reality to try to fix them because he knew if he consulted everyone else in the foundation about it they would kill them immediately it seems they found out about it in the future arc so anyways the remnants go into a virtual reality where all there memories are erased from before they all met eachother so everyone was in there normal mindset things are going smoothly until an ai junko takes over the virtual reality they dont know its a virtual reality yet and she makes them go through the death game they go through the game and then due to special circumstances everyone who died in the virtual reality is now in a comatose state on an island and they may never wake up odds are they did but thatll probably be reality in the future arc side note kyoko and togami helped nagi help the remnants of despair this is all a very brief summarization there was the other game that goes over how junko got ahold of all those monokumas but to summarize that very quickly she got the help of an elementary school version of her who had heavy influence on a huge corporation that had all the monokumas made its not as ridiculous im just skipping over all the details anyways at the end of that game the mini junko is thought to have died but she didnt and is now probably around and has made their next attack in the future arc im skipping over a lot here but this is all just a brief summarization and i hope i didnt miss anything too important
anime,removed,i use nipponsei to torrent music
anime,removed,putting s ttgl and plastic memories in there is just cruel haha

anime,removed,erased umm yes plastic memories had a lovely romance you shouldnt need to spoiler tag though i think
anime,removed,it looks like there are missing pages in that imgur upload
anime,removed,
anime,removed,its so refreshing to see a romance anime where they get together at the beginning so you actually get to see their relationship develop instead of spending the whole season saying just kiss her already
anime,removed,thats the point it took the expectations and threw them straight out the window snapped the joints out of them as they with their dying breath whispered i love you to the main character it brutally shows the consequences of being stupid and its fucking fantastic

anime,removed,the hatred i feel for this woman is unmatched really there are a number of women i hate more than a teacher who sleeps around a little kayos abusive mother from erased for one satsuki and ryokos mom from kill la kill for another annie from attack on titan who literally killed and ate some of her former friends medusa from soul eater after what she did to crona akito sohma from fruits basket for the horrible things she did to her family there are a number of actually evil women in anime that did genuinely terrible things that dont involve the high crimes of sleeping with a former student and being a cocktease to a coworker because a teenagers jealousy makes her laugh i dont even know what to say to you if you genuinely mean that and arent exaggerating is this like the first drama youve ever watched did your mom cheat on your dad or something is this like personal for you because otherwise i dont understand how you would say that surely you have more stringent standards than that
anime,removed,any gaijin can do it check out
anime,removed,geeking out super hard to the point of embarrassment you dont think a bunch of guys carring stuffed dolls from an ufo catcher isnt geeky or embarasing fantasasing about tooru dressed as a furry isnt geeky do you even have standars the game they buy for multiplayer its even called geekgear
anime,removed,those solutions would be easy alone but not when youre sitting in a circle excuses excuses but like i said id rather not be around groups of people even when im not playing games i could be sitting there twiddling my thumbs and i would rather be alone literally nothing to do with being ashamed or embarrassed just people are annoying youre just proving me beyond reasonable doubt that youre a loner thanks for clearing that up

anime,removed,marika was actually sick though
anime,removed,right their crushes seem unobtainable because of the age difference but how is it interesting to observe them reacting in the worst way possible one would think that an enjoyable story would be about them dealing with their reality and find a solution not running away sort of speak and doing the most reprehensible things i cant understand that joy in watching the story unfold let me clarify i know that art also includes the disgusting the decrepit and immoral and are viewed as interesting but lets be real here there is nothing likeable about the characters its not like finding a diamond in a pile of trash nor the enjoyment that one would find in an anime like death note where the anti hero meets his well deserved end and balance is restored in the world this is just a train wreak leading to no satisfying end i cant enjoy any aspect of it not the happiness of the side characters not the disgusting behavior of the main character

anime,removed,i did say i dropped it p i just prefer iori maybe inaba improves as a character but i wouldnt know since i dont plan on watching the show again
anime,removed,i fucking hated maid sama because misaki falls for takumi and winds up getting fucking married the depths of my hate for this show run deep and im glad i dropped it i have never given a shit but this show makes me almost irrationally angry the only other one that pissed me off like legit made me mad was the first chapter of teppu holy shit honestly i dont know which one i hate more fucking natsuo is horrible and is just as bad as fucking misaki they are both horrible but for different reasons

anime,removed,if you are enjoying this video please come check out the porter robinson subreddit at rporterrobinson
anime,removed,well sure im speaking from memory so i may miss a few things but for me cowboy bebop was essentially a story about a few people and critters who had see the rough side of life people who loved and lost who were cast out who were hurt mistreated wronged finding each other and finding some sort of solace a beacon of hope a small light at the end of a tunnel if you will from togetherness they found healing and hope the movie starts with two people they are stuck in a rut down on their luck unable to get out their life is boring routine and basically they are just drifting waiting for something both dont think they have anythin else to hope for just wait to die but also go down doing the only thing they know to do fight and survive but that is not enough and then by a chance of luck everything changes they meet and adopt ein faye and ed and their life suddenly changes there is laughter there is friendship comradery there is something all of those people are broken down husks wanderers but together there is a new way of life for them they find something all of them thought was lost forever and they endure together when we revisit during the anime the story of each and every other persons backstory normally those people would run away from their past but together they have the strenght to face it and finally close the chapter i dont remember too well but i think that normally jet would never go back to his old home but he is forced to go there because of the events of the story correct me if im wrong he can do it because he is stronger as a person and as a character he can finally put his past behind him close the chapter and move on when it was just him and spike he would never do it but with ein ed and faye he can his life has changed the same goes with faye she is constantly on the run from her past her debt her memories and she still is when she meets the main heroes but after sharing her memories with them her stories her vulnerabilities she can finally face her past and plow through it which lead to a satisfying conclusion with her debt yet there is still her troubled and mysterious past but she is only able to deal with it when she has spike and jet with her she can only do it when they actually are invested in her its them who make the double trip for a vcr technology just because their friend received a mysterious packgage had faye been alone when this parcel arrived she would probably never open it and watch it she would probably just throw it away she is still unable to watch it with them but because she is with them she finds strength inside to face her past and memories and she finally watches it and triggers her memories which leads her to discover her roots she is again only able to do it when she has a strong bond of friendship to follow through with it ed is a hurt lonely child she is scared and feels stuck in her life so she needs an escape i may be wrong here since its been a very long time but she wants to escape a terrible life which has no hopes for better future her father is gone driven madly by his own desires and earth is in shambles not knowing wether you will live or die in a meteor debris strike there is nothing there to care for only orphaned children poverty and disease ed thinks she will die on earth alone and sad and she is terrified she desperately seeks a way out an escape of this terrible future and joins the first thing that comes along she really doesnt care what happens to her she just needs a way out of this death trap she cant even call home she thinks her father doesnt care for her and she has nothing to live for but dying in space during an adventure seems a hundred times better than dying along with other orphaned children on earth ed actually has a powerfull arc thanks to friendship and unwilling father figures that spike and jet become for her she discovers that even in outer space what matters is people being driven by a common goal helping others she learns that fear does not control her and she understands that its better to devote oneself to something a person a cause a dream instead of being driven by circumstance and chance she sees the flaws in spike jet and faye and she actually is the one that makes the right choice to leave them when she understands her fathers devotion to making lives of people on earth better by mapping meteordebris hit zones i cant be sure that is his goal to make the terrain safer for other people or just because of his crazy dream but he is willing to devote his life towards achieving his goal nothing will stop him and ed sees his ambition and will to go up against any odds and she decides to join him saddly taking ein with her his betrayal of spike and jet is very harsh for me he was there before ed so he should remain there after ed in my opinion his leaving was a crucial point that jet and spike are beyond redemption they will not ever find peace or a life goarl they are essentially dead and while i can agree this may be true with spike although him and faye couldve become something if they were willing to be more vulnerable again her revelation and his past just clashed at the wrong time but jet is still not done with his life he just put to rest his demons now he can finally become a man free of his demons and he already has a family to care for but no him and spike in the egg eating scene is painfully obvious there is no hope for them they will die faye leaves them because she discovers her past but for me this is wrong she found the strength to discover it endure it and live past it she wants to live but he clings to her past i cant make out her motivation for leavingshe found her pastits obviously a closed chapter in her life and she goes there and stays there does she mean to rebuild her past right there i cant understand it and her going away is the final nail in spikes coffin the last shred of what held a spark of life left him him being already dead once was especially hard to become alive again but with ed ein and faye he may be able to do it faye either sees this and still decides to leave him or is unable to get him to leave his past behind him being driven only by revenge is sad and clashes with his way of life water flows constantly water is not driven by revenge or emotions he should be able to step past it and live but he cant so he dies and leaves poor jet all alone jet is like the bebop old and rusty but as long as the last engine still runs he will also endure but without spike and the rest he will become an empty husk in an empty void without life without emotion just a machine driven by the last remnants of energy untill if too finally dies alone in space the ending does not satisfy mebesides from ed none of the characters finds happiness and they already had it together jet will suffer alone he will never take another partner faye will die on earth unless she returns to her roguish way of life basically deleting all her growth and reverting to what she was when we first met her spike is dead he didnt have or didnt give himself another chance ed and ein are the only ones that made a choice good or bad they will live with it but live they will i hate the ending since it doesnt give closure to characters it forces jet and faye to die alone even if spike was lost from the begining i like to believe he had a chance
anime,removed,does anyone know a good anime forum that doesnt have powertripping virgin weebs as mods
anime,removed,shelter madeon and porter robinson
anime,removed,stop sucking their dick
anime,removed,
anime,removed,removed lul
anime,removed,source himself
anime,removed,im just waiting for porter himself to come and comment in this thread because hes pretty fucking upset about this whole situation today the ranime mods reached a new low
anime,removed,shelter is a original music video and the other one is an amv amvs a defined by taking existing visual footage from an anime and overlaying music its fan work a la fan art of fan fiction derived from an original japanese medium shelter was conceived from scratch by an american artist even though its animated by japanese animators produced in japan etc it seems as though the american conception is the delegitimizing factor
anime,removed,an amv is an anime music video someone takes footage from an anime or even several and syncs them up to music to make a music video sometimes theyre used to showcase a ship between characters or a theme in a show shelter is a storymusic video with animation specifically for it and there really shouldnt be a problem if amvs can be posted here then shelter should be able to be here too
anime,removed,and it is indeed anime specific
anime,removed,deleted before you posted this reply
anime,removed,they did the same with a thread that reached the front page with one of my videos and with over upvotes with a healthy discussion it really makes no sense tbh
anime,removed,hey there mods before this gets deleted id like to counter your statement of what anime means to you this music video was produced and aired in japan by studios it also was shown all over japan through huge marketing campaigns and ultimately made it on to the big advertisement screens in the crowded cities so please stop acting so elitist and be fair dont make an argument about the definition of anime then respond to this video in a way that contradicts that argument did you forget that anime is specifically japanese animation
anime,removed,its that anime that came out like hours ago and many people here enjoyed it i wonder what happened
anime,removed,shelter
anime,removed,it literally has a mal now
anime,removed,sword art online is my favorite anime the studio pictures
anime,removed,it makes me sad that all weve had is rezero fanart for months solid and then a super cool new short film reaches front page and then straight away gets deleted
anime,removed,shelter nah it doesnt count as anime because the video keep remove by ranime mod s
anime,removed,i dont remember the show having too much of a loose end isnt the last episode a crescendo of conflict into the climax of amazing grace and finished with the peaceful aftermathconflict avoided its been more than five years since i watched that show so maybe im forgetting something
anime,removed,dude now you gotta delete your own thread thats meta
anime,removed,sports
anime,removed,the original post hasnt actually been reinstated though its just you reposting it on your own with a condescending message to boot 🤔 but yes i feel plenty ashamed right now after all i and the rest of the users on this sub were the ones who got into a power trip mode over a petty definition 🐸☕️
anime,removed,too bad this stupid drama is going to overshadow this awesome video but glad that certain mods have shown that theyre entirely unfit to reside here
anime,removed,im pretty sure all the initial shitstorm was just a roundabout way of making sure the mods get the karma for posting this video
anime,removed,this post has been reinstated because enough of you are terrible people and were sending death threats actual fucking death threats about this as much as that sucks that shouldnt be why this post was reinstated it fits in this subreddit just as much as anything else and it deserves to reach the audience it appeals to here im sorry to hear about the death threats but dont try to guilt trip the nonviolent people here who were reasonably upset for the decisions of the other mods take responsibility for your actions youre supposed to be an example for this place are you not also nice video i always loved porters and madeons stuff
anime,removed,mods can fuck themselves tbh
anime,removed,hey now lets not stoop to their level im sure not all mods signed off on the initial decision its just that when they send over their mods to new theyre not sending their best theyre sending the ones who rate oreimo and strike witches over flcl trump supporters antagonistic jerks who would exclude a whole subset of the community from participating in a meet up and some i assume are good people
anime,removed,they are definitely good people i know them they are huge for this subreddit sad
anime,removed,i agree with you the time period between spike and his girl reuniting and her getting shot by a random grunt is just way too short for me to care about it its an alright ending but i dont think its as great as people say it is
anime,removed,literally butthurt weebs
anime,removed,lol uneito did you realize your crying post was the only one that wasnt actually anime related
anime,removed,full movie of this plz full movie of this plz full movie of this plz full movie of this plz full movie of this plz full movie of this plz full movie of this plz full movie of this plz

anime,removed,the mistake was letting the porter robinson twitter brigade dictate the subreddit rules
anime,removed,anime is serious business you guys
anime,removed,i wonder how many people have unsubbed over this i might follow if its one thing i cant stand is censorship this world has enough of it
anime,removed,i dont know why people are so upset over these mod people what anime do they appear in
anime,removed,people typing up things as you are arent any better parsing through your last few comments you were making snarky remarks and helping fuel all that drama they already received what hundreds of replies speaking on how people felt about it they got the message let it rest
anime,removed,gg ez
anime,removed,lets get meta here the future of this board is hindered by people like udrnyanpasu being able to be a mod we dont need people with mindsets like them we need people who are concerned about the future of the medium and the integrity of art would udrnyanpasu remove a post regarding howls moving castle because its based on a novel by dianna wynne jones a british novelist not japanese no no they wouldnt the anime industry has already started to become an international stake and a dang successful one looking at how well a business like crunchyroll as the perfect example especially since theyre involved in the situation at hand have done and screw this whole definition of anime bs as if it isnt just an abbreviation for animation my anime has to be purebred japanese i find this funny because the first thing i saw when i came on this sub today was an advertisement at the top that said a thrilling new adventure from the cocreator of avatar the last airbender and the legend of korra all of which are nonjapanese nice something like this a collaboration from a japanese studio and a western artist is incredibly important and a beautiful step to the bright future of anime which is getting bigger and bigger every day people like udrnyanpasu who stir up something so conservative and question the integrity of art like this are not needed keep it friendly and be respectful i read the most friendly and respectful i can be to udrnyanpasu is this much fuck you
anime,removed,thanks i think your view on spike and the syndicate is valid althought im still pretty sure faye does not return to bebop their last talk is their goodbye she is leaving the bebop forever i always thought she mightve stayed if spike didnt go to his death and he mightve not went if she wouldve stayed its just my personal feeling though i think that the anime told us that together they are much stronger than each one individually only together they would be able to face their past and their own demons alone none of them was ed is the only one of them who didnt accumulate enough bad memories that she can actually face the rest of the life on her own with her father she just needed a better perspective and being with the group gave her that i think that spike was this dead inside drifter at the start he didnt like people dying people he couldnt save but during the anime he changed he no longer thought only of himself him with jet going out of their way to get faye the vcr was proof to me that he cared about other people than himself and sure he saw a lot of people dying but he also learned a lot the metal queen episode i believe gave him some good pointers on life and other episodes also i think he might have came to rely on others and work together together with faye they took down the religious cult that in my opinion shouldve been stronger and i think they finally shouldve faced the syndicate together and won without him dying that would be the satisfying ending to me im not a native english speaker its harder for me to write like this and be more aesthetically pleasing but ill try that i dont think cowboy bebop renders spoiler warnings to be necessary its like going to rstarwars and warning people to not tell that darth vader is lukes father its just common knowdlegde for fans at this point and people new to anime are basically told to start with cowboy bebop fullmetal alchemist and death note i dont think anybody should be offended at spoilers
anime,removed,okay so apparently my post about it was taken down so im gonna put it short again come and get me udrnyanpasu is a menace and needs to be taken down from mod position
anime,removed,everyone dm the mods make sure that people like drnyanpasu are no longer allowed to moderate this board todays incident is an insult to a piece of art that very passionate artists worked hard to create and we can not allow people like the mods in question to take that away from them and us
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i mean it was at least mods uneito and udrnyanpasu
anime,removed,you may be getting banned not for the issue but because of the insistence with the topic the video is top of ranime reposted multiple times what else is there to say
anime,removed,looks like we found a nazi how many jews did you kill to day
anime,removed,mm is called rape you sick fucks
anime,removed,toradoras ending was bittersweet at first because of course taiga goes off for months without saying anything but in the end its a pretty good ending
anime,removed,i saw the part and now i am kinda over it i hear there is more but i dont know if it worth the time with avdol dead
anime,removed,i am still up voting your post
anime,removed,that wasnt maes hughes the character in the op gets introduced later on in episode or youll love him hes great
anime,removed,hey this isnt an animated series as the rules state take it down udrnyanpasu do what you do best
anime,removed,what all that hot sweaty s mana action failed to turn you on
anime,removed,huh i always thought that s because the eye was active she was actually revealing her scheme but when the eye fades away near the end she regresses back to her true feelings
anime,removed,not sure whether this is spoilery id like to think not but s the robber scene shows that both aoba and kou had superb motion vision which is expressed as a trait of an athlete based on how amazing that feat is as illustrated through this scenario its fair to assume that these two are much more than beyond your average athlete which comes into play later for making what happens realistic its not just a bootcamped for a week with lb ankle weights and now i throw a fastball or whatever you get to watch real progression for these two athletes who have been established as gifted from the very beginning and this is just another proof of their talent
anime,removed,you mean vote for the one who s froze up in terror and got bit
anime,removed,yeah and he gave his eyes to kakashi
anime,removed,only if its done well kanaki was tortured by jason for a while and then he becomes a badass and kills him and then he automatically knows how to fight and joins the bad guys thats bad writing imo
anime,removed,is this what autism looks like can you not understand people on any level
anime,removed,im guessing ushio will eliminate nagisa again
anime,removed,lol
anime,removed,how did armin die lots of people keep posting about that
anime,removed,fuck thats my favorite trope before i give you subredditrelevant answers though have you ever watch avatar the last airbender i feel like youd adore it anyway s princess tutu absolutely spoiled because its a major plot point though i really enjoyed their relationship progression in this show a few characters in fmab oh damn no mainstream shounens dennou coil iirc that is the two main characters go through a lot of hardships before they reach a mutual friendship its a fun show and probably one of the best scifi anime out there revolutionary girl utena so much this theres an extremely impactful scene near the end that highlights the characters relationships if you dont mind spoilers s after something episodes of dueling utena and the other members of student council play badminton together and have whats imo the best conversation of the show i think i cried im not entirely sure youll like any of these based on your list but its worth a shot i think youd probably enjoy fmab and denno coil the most
anime,removed,s snape dies
anime,removed,s blood s will s flow
anime,removed,subaru for rezero most annoying character ive ever seen even his redemption scene in episode i thought was super cheesy
anime,removed,yeah her character was pointless tooall this drama to capture them only to kill herself
anime,removed,overrated emiya kiritsugu hes a great character but im not sure why hes so widely loved here overhated emiya shirou i get hes a little retarded at times but people act like he the worst fate character and single handedly ruins anything he appears in
anime,removed,this is gold my sides are literally in orbit
anime,removed,k
anime,removed,you think thats bad theyre engaged in the light novels p
anime,removed,he is overhated most definitely but to claim he has the best character development is one big overstatement people who hate him because he is le edgy emo are not taking his early lifechildhood into consideration and then dismiss his character as a whiny emo lets do a recap he is an uchiha one of the biggest and strongest clans in konoha his brother whom he admires is a child prodigy who went through all the ranks one can go through at a young age and is hailed as a genius suddenly one day his brother slaughters his entire clan except for sasuke he traps sasuke in a genjutsu and tells him he is weak and has to become stronger to defeat him and all that jazz sasuke never gets an explanation as to why itachi did what he did until he is much older so him being hellbent on revenge and wanting to kill his brother above all else is entirely understandable what isnt understandable and this is a thing that kishimoto fucked up are the changes in his morale throughout the show he goes from kid with a shit childhood and a wish to kill his brother to psychotic killer who tried to kill his friends multiple times and then back to the first he was never consistent i feel that kishi really didnt do the character the justice which he deserved he shouldve just sticked to sasuke either being a person who has one goal in mind or sasuke getting twisted into a psychopath due to everything that ever happened and learning about the entire story but him switching from friend to foe from foe to friend and back again was just stupid on kishis part and when people hate the character for that i can actually understand it most people do hate him for the wrong reasons tho
anime,removed,s i will do my best to provide a heartwarming happy story to our viewers this made me lose my head
anime,removed,the catgirl is a guy
anime,removed,my bad but to be fair it was never stated that she was a girli think
anime,removed,in erased the scenes are in aspect ratio whereas the scenes that take place in s are in aspect ratio this is what gives the cinematic look to the show
anime,removed,i never considered the whole s chimera nina to be sad just tragic i saw it coming from miles away and while its fucked up its not as heartbreaking as people keep making it out to be sure its a meme and whatnot but i get annoyed when they rate that over s hughes death or any other scene for that matter
anime,removed,definitely i always saw him as s a cheater on his wife and a lier i just never felt the hype for his character myself
anime,removed,no it doesnt look at the latest manga chapter its pretty much the same
anime,removed,idk why tho by episode it shouldve been obvious that satoru was not gonna end up with hinazuki
anime,removed,well you see the thing my weeb shitter friend is that kabaneri was shit since the beginning look at me am a weeb who likes psychologicaledgy characters sometimes im bullied at school kabaneri is the best and so is aot would second season them again
anime,removed,and people like you are the reason why everyone hates people that watch anime youre fucking autistic
anime,removed,i started crying my ass off when she got picked then again when she arrived then again when that gif happened

anime,removed,s the kaiser didnt die of illness he passed away having used up all of his lifetime he didnt fall from illness everyone please dont forget that
anime,removed,i never really thought of gintama as a show thats susceptible to plot heavy spoilers and to me if someone with zero knowlege about the plot watched that scene then all they would register is the flashy fighting and music basically i wanted to show how the animation during fights in this show are amazing and the music sounds badass s they can find out about the truly amazing underlying plot later also is it really a spoiler if they dont know whats happening all they have is a beginning and end they dont know what happened in the middle which is the best part
anime,removed,but no next arc is for rem
anime,removed,thats the s i want something genuine episode right no idea whys that controversial though
anime,removed,samurai champloo the s zombie asteroid episode what the fuck
anime,removed,in your terms what did you think was wrong with the final two episodes i thought it was the best thing the franchise has given me with it finalizing shinjis growth the hectic directing making a constant stream of consciousness everyones insecurities being fully revealed and cemented to the audience etc etc
anime,removed,im assuming its s mustang vs envy
anime,removed,shirou vs gilgamesh

anime,removed,how great was that finale i made two polls for best girl and best insert song i wasnt sure if i should put in the school trio and the lady who worked at the disaster corps but who knows maybe one of them is someones best girl for the best insert song i left out the school song cause i didt think anyone would choose that over the other so if it is your favorite insert song i apologize i dont have any clips for the insert songs but i think i can leave the files here right we start off with another op skip so you know shit is gonna go down again and boy did shit go down start off with biki tsubasa and chris showing off their xdrives and destroying that mob of noise then we move to fine merging with durandal and we have a villain with regenerative powers and destructive force but tsubasa and chris dont give a shit and maneuver their way inside to get durandal to biki biki almost loses herself to her berserk mode again but with the help of everyone shes able to control herself for a slash biki just wouldnt be biki if she straight up killed fine she still wanted to understand and befriend fine and she left it up to fine to unite the future as biki protects the present i liked the messageslessons that tsubasa and chris left its important to have dreams but its also important to strive for a future that allows the chance for successful dreams your life isnt just defined by what you do its also defined by what you leave behind for he future and then the mad women go blow up part of the moon and they are alive weve got lots more great stuff to look forward to in the next seasons
anime,removed,gohans death history of trunks honestly the track playing was so chilling maes hughes death fma brotherhood the blood covering the picture always tugs at my heartstrings for some reasons saitama revealing his workout method one punch man what can i say it gives goosebumps and makes me feel sad about my life sasuke approaching itachi naruto what can i say i love them both but i wanted to see sasuke get demolished
anime,removed,guy has a cute little sister he sinks all other ships in the anime just to be with her why because wincest afterwards they unwillingly break up and anime fanbase starts an uprising over it

anime,removed,madoka magica based on commentspics ive read here a group of moe looking magical girls come together they do stuff that proves they arent really typical moe magical girls theres also a pink haired girl whos probably the mc theres most likely some lies betreyals crying and screaming also some kind of plot twist or something mind blowing happens at the end maybe theres some time travel in there too supposedly fun for the whole family
anime,removed,im pretty sure its episode of attack on titan when the music ramps up and eren plugs the hole its just amazing
anime,removed,akame ga kill everyone dies
anime,removed,oregairu when confesses he wants something genuine and starts crying
anime,removed,one pieces blackbeard
anime,removed,has anyone got a link to a batch torrent preferably but is fine too
anime,removed,all he does is do what any guy would do if girls were constantly throwing themselves at him
anime,removed,im gonna kill the five kage because theyre responsible for the way the world is now especially the two who i know for a fact have only been kage for about years and one of them being a kid no older than me who i should be relating with super hard
anime,removed,as someone who has seen the first season the biggest innaccuracy here is that the tit demon who kills him isnt technically a demon the one who resurrects him is in fact a demon
anime,removed,you must not know a lot of attractive guys
anime,removed,disregarding the fact that yuki lived thru endless times the idea of watching what is essentially the same episode times to purposely annoy yourself to sympathise with a character is pretty far fetched
anime,removed,the web that all disney fans are sure to love new videos every saturday
anime,removed,s flower field scene in rebellion whether or not that was what madoka really wanted deep down their conversation in the flower field is the final push that made homura do what she did it was even really clear in the ending that she knows she did something completely horrible her own familiars are throwing tomatoes at her ffs saying she did everything out of downright selfishness is imo ignorant and disservices the movie s about why everything happened the way they did do you remember homuras wish thats right to remeet madoka and be the one to protect her let me ask given that homura doesnt rebel and goes to mahoushoujo heaven whats stopping kyubey from performing the same experiments on another helpless magical girl letting the incubators continue their antics of getting a hold of madoka contradicts homuras wish but not going to mahoushoujo heaven contradicts madokas wish so what happened the last time someone made a paradoxical wish yeah they become gods which is exactly what happened to homura at the ending you might be thinking but taking down madoka ruins her wish of saving magical girls well homura herself said that she only took a part of the law of cycles but other than that left it alone

anime,removed,maybe not hate but started out as a really interesting character but as the s she became just another harem chick desperate to ride mckuns dick it drained pretty much all satisfaction from the fact that the best girl won for once
anime,removed,funny you said that
anime,removed,if there is a anime god please make them a couple and dont start the shenanigans with the other dude like its happening in the manga also anna for best girl
anime,removed,in the preview for the next episode theres chidori breaking down while seeing kacchon and sonozaki talking alone so yeah itll happen even without a kiss but the person you love running away in the middle of your confession to another girl is already reason enough to be crushed imo

anime,removed,if you want to listen to the songs again both versions
anime,removed,unmarked spoilers the show really hardly has a plot apart from the one about eyes trying to escape an anime girls poorly drawn face
anime,removed,could you edit this comment to use the name of the show youre referencing in the title of the spoiler tag
anime,removed,i assume itll be subbed and available on the standard watchsites i like gogoanime myself
anime,removed,first off its pretty fucking cringeworthy take that dumb shit somewhere else thats just your insecure and frankly shitty opinion second its only making peoples opinions of anime fans go down the drain lmao again just you being an insecure child about your hobbies who gives a fuck what non anime fans think of the posts in an nsfw thread on ranime grow up third its against the rules debatable tldr i dont give a fuck what you want go fuck yourself
anime,removed,it took them years last time
anime,removed,marriage between first cousins isnt illegal in states canada mexico and all of europe doesnt make it socially acceptable
anime,removed,the problem is the ambiguity behind both kyon who is constantly deluding himself and haruhi who seems like her head is constantly in the clouds is what makes the story interesting it might make a lot more sense if we follow the story from haruhis perspective but the rest of the cast would suffer for it more importantly haruhi constantly shifts the world in slight innocuous ways and we wouldnt be able to appreciate it from haruhis perspective that and its heavily implied that kyon and not haruhi is actually god and that kyon just gives out omnipotence out on a whim to people who make the world more interesting kyon may not even be consciously aware of it but his narration almost makes a game in some places of pointing out information that kyon has no logical way of knowing without some degree of omniscience the story is a lot more fun when you look at it as a god goes on vacation gives his powers to the first person who seems interesting and then forces himself to forget his omnipotence than a girl with unknowing godlike powers realizes that her love interest is playing an elaborate prank on her
anime,removed,and he hasnt even touched on the part later in the story where kira truly gets relatable

anime,removed,look i agree with you on all accounts thats not the point though in this particular case the time elapsed and viewership have combined to make it a nonissue and thats exactly how spoilers work despite what you or even i think about them by the way marlon brando dies at the end of the godfather
anime,removed,fmab was just really boring because all it really ever was about was finding the philosophers stone not only was the introduction abysmal and didnt connect to me ed and als story but it felt like more of a drag through than an adventure with countless characters being randomly introduced yet most of them not making me care about them and just being there without any significant ambitions i could write an entire essay on what i think hxh did better but ill just sum it up quickly every charactergroup introduced had their own idealsdesires that stuck out perfectly and were synced in near flawlessly with the plot it made it a lot easier to sympathize with characters like meruem and hisoka once you understood their true intentions which werent simple good vs evil experiencing gon and killuas interactions in every arc is what made this more of an adventure rather than a story it was an absolute breeze to go through and while others might disagree it almost never felt tedious or overdone the ending has its own problems but it was much better than that of fmabs i like fmab dont get me wrong but i think the are in entirely different leagues
anime,removed,if you keep dying over and over again and coming back to redo shit i would be pretty insane too so i have sympathy for subaru except for that time when he rejected rem so he fucking deserves it lol

anime,removed,if anyone remembers httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlulhkgffltq i watched the whole anime shinkyoku soukai polyphonica the whole time i was wondering if something would happen but s nothing interesting ever happens i regret doing so otherwise as far as anime that some people liked i thought chaika was pretty bad the artwork was awful particularly the mcs hair his sister seemed like a bad parody of the sisterwhowantsherbrother trope and chaika was straight up stupid neat concept but the execution was pretty bad i tried watching it with a friend of mine and she couldnt get over how bad the mcs hair was
anime,removed,using what i remember from high school bio and high school drama assuming four weeks for her to notice i believe roughly five weeks into pregnancy it looks kinda like a tadpole and about the size of your palm she should start showing in about double that time but only enough for her gyno or her to notice

anime,removed,im so tempted to read manga but at the same time i kinda liked the feeling of being betrayed by the manga readers getting trolled both by one and the manga readers was a frustratingly pleasant experience and im looking forward to what kind of bullshit the manga readers are up to if we ever get a season s reigen is totally claws boss u guys game over s reigen is actually a rly strong psychic just watch s gasmaskchan is a cute loli maaaaaaan go fuck yourselves but dont because i love you damn this is a complicated relationship

anime,removed,s or maybe they follow the novol but create a new ending where kumiko and reina are together i can dream
anime,removed,i think its better for yuri content sure theres plenty of girls that get teased as a couple and when the show ends theyre precious friends but ive only seen one show garei zero where a girl showed interest in another girl but ended up with a guy
anime,removed,kyubey is that you
anime,removed,or maybe an ova set like years into the future and they have this horrible little kid that breaks all the shit and taiga is all i wonder where this little shit got this from and ryuuji is all i wonder where ahem im calm one can always dream
anime,removed,the talk before they fight the maniwa guy really shows how much shichika changes by tye end of the series its tgat ezact mindset that he himself criticises when fighting the doll its such an amazing and natural transition
anime,removed,s im pretty sure with forcing more screentime to reina they have to force that ship remember kyoto isnt exactly known for following material to the dot the last time they did this was haruhi if they actually dont pair those two then the entire anime community is going to go nuclear on kyoto this time for real

anime,removed,i really didnt like toradora everybody tells me its their favorite romance or even anime but i really had a problem with the characters aside from ryuji and ami i thought that all of the characters were very annoying and each had their own quirks especially taigas loli tsundere im not a lolicon so i wasnt attracted to her character at all i didnt really enjoy seeing you could argue that ryuji and ami had them too but they are the only ones i found tolerable i felt really bad for minorin because she and ryuji had always liked each other but she gave up her feelings for taiga which kind of reminds me of onodera from nisekoi i also felt really bad for ryuji because i dont understand how you could live with someone who abuses you and is just overall ungrateful to you even though you cook for them an care for them idk im sure i will be downvoted for this considering how much everyone loves toradora

anime,removed,including ranimes waifu rem who
anime,removed,yes
anime,removed,i saw it a month or ago for the first time the only reason that i havent rated it is that i really just couldnt understand the main character s like the whole younger sibling dying could have been easily avoided if he had just stopped being such an ignorant and lazy person im not sure if im missing something though maybe i need to give it another watch
anime,removed,repeating the same thing over and over again what could go wrong be like homura dont ever give up

anime,removed,well thats the end of volume happens right after a political maneuver by a rebel faction within the country and sets the tone for the rest of the series with the quote thus the story began in the true sense of the word the skilled manager of the invincible status quo ikta solork and the last princess of the katjvarna empire chamille kitora katjvanmaninik these two lined up together and ran at full speed toward the next battle of their promised defeat that was changed in a way to add yatori there they know what sells but other than that ending volume with that was the right hook thats the same as ending this season with that
anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,here we torrent there may be fan groups
anime,removed,well to be fair s he didnt actually die from the skyscraper in ajin
anime,removed,obviously nsfw
anime,removed,yeah this episode and the next really go into the mental anguish he was going through and i really feel that was a big part of howit was shown in the manga probably the only thing so far i thought the manga did better
anime,removed,thats not even the sad part s or when he and rem constantly ger captured by the witch cult and they both go through a cycle of being horrifically tortured killed and driven insane from watching the other one be cut to pieces infront of them wonder if we will get to that in the anime
anime,removed,is uairencracken supposed to be an awful mod is this some kind of joke
anime,removed,i agree five wasnt the greatest but what i hated more s they didnt really give us much background on her and how she was related to nine and twelve aside from that brief flashback thay showed them as kids but didnt really say much she just had poor development in general
anime,removed,

anime,removed,what anime have you seen how dark do you want do you want i am psychologically broken and have contemplated suicide do you want i just saw my best friend turn into a demon kill all of my friends rape my girlfriend and i just had to stab off my own arm with a broken sword and this just resulted in me losing an eye im now on a path of revenge and death
anime,removed,yes its a good thing a walking trash bin like you ruined an otherwise fantastic laugh for people mind going back to the dump and living amongst your brethren now cause people hate this kind if shit your doing clever to remove it so no one can bitch to you about it unless they saved the thread to show someone like me lets keep up the rem pictures though those are contributing in a much better way this certainly is much worse thanks for keeping this sub up to pathetic standards mumma hitler while im thanking you lets scratch eachothers back take that thanks with you to a cliff for me and make sure it gets to the bottom really quick for me guide it down there with a pleasant jump will ya
anime,removed,fango simply for how nuts he is hes not quite on the same level as ladd russo but hes entertaining
anime,removed,angered ragyo kiryuin klk raping her daughter like usual being a fucking nazi and so much else annoyed ghost banri golden time he single handled sinks the anime really
anime,removed,i loved the first season though thought the hitomi arc was kinda meh then we reach as and the first half is completely boring and then it gets bullshit past ushios death the first time i watched it the version i got didnt have the miracle ending episode i think its a better place to end at her death than elsewhere
anime,removed,i havent seen many genuinely sad anime deaths ive seen another but thats well thats another ball game altogether probably ushio from clannad after story is the saddest one ive seen that one fucked me up good for a day or two
anime,removed,wth wasnt rokuro suppose to transform
anime,removed,ugh im going to tell you again ubw does not give you the superhuman abilities of a servant you could be an e ranked servant in every stat and no human without some form of sorcery is going to beat you in strength speed or reaction ubw does not give any of these things before you even pull out history of the weapon thats a a mistranslation and b not the intent of the sentence c the entire point was goldie is overall a shit swordsman when faced with another servant who actually has swordsman skills for example tracing sabers weapon in ubw would allow him to fight with her skill but not her power and speed to hammer the point home ubw and reinforcementprojection magic are his only skills due to his usual situation ie even with ubw against a goofing off goldie goldie should win times
anime,removed,not to nitpick too much but werent saber alters eyes a dull yellow rather than red it added to her corpselike look
anime,removed,code geass spoiler
anime,removed,the way she said that made it sound like one of misaka clones d i guess i should be saying the railgun series but its been so long since i watched the series that i dont remember where index and railgun overlap
anime,removed,i did not like shirley at all but her death hit me pretty hard
anime,removed,rezero isnt a love story and it will never be one its silly to critique and regard it as such rem serves as a way to show subarus character improving past who he was before a neet who would jump at the chance to marry a waifubait perfect girl and he almost did while she does partially serve to please the market the way her character is designed is waifubait but also for good reason she doesnt please the market for the sole purpose of pleasing market
anime,removed,shame that bluehaired wixen is stealing the spotlight youre going to be happy httpiimgurcomztntlzlpng
anime,removed,i havent read the novel but it seems like it is mostly the same if i understand rightbut dont quote me on it for some reason it took a really long time for that chapter to get translated and there has only been one done for it relatively recently
anime,removed,i just found a site that has all of them translated as well as some of the short stories going to take me a while to read them
anime,removed,i just cant understand why this show is not as popular as it should be in here then again ranime has shit taste
anime,removed,no wonder he dumped that side bitch rem
anime,removed,well for subaru emilia didnt try to murder him a few times
anime,removed,not at all in nasuverse hassani sabbah is the title given to the leader of the assassins organization there have been different people that have had the title hassani sabbah in order to become the next leader one has to develop a special ability named zabaniya these are the only spirits that can be summoned under the assassin class in the fuyuki grail war due to the title being the origin of the word assassin thus acting as a catalyst fsn hassan true assassin was the hassan of the cursed arm who had the ability zabaniya delusional heartbeat fz hassan on the other hand was the hundred face hassan who had the ability zabaniya delusional illusion which is the noble phantasm that splits hundred face into multiple personalities this is the hassan that is currently in fate kaleid it is the same title for all fuyuki war assassins but they are not the same heroic spirit the comment above was asking why kaleid doesnt use cursed arm hassan instead of hundred face since the former is the wars true assassin
anime,removed,oh you are in for a ride hahaha i hope you keep watching
anime,removed,the villain in erased
anime,removed,seesh yuki yuna was a parade of those s tougou doesnt get punished for wanting to destroy the world the hospital girls also goes untouched despite helping tougou on her mad quest the girls are apparently okay with their parents wanting to literally sacrifice them yuna basically never gets called a liar anymore despite still lying what a mad world do these girls live in
anime,removed,i love how your bnha description is basically just all might
anime,removed,so im on the last episode of the seven deadly sins this show is everything i love about anime fun combat a more powerful than he seems protagonist turncoats joining the team the right amount of fan service strong male and female characters and fun lessons learned kind of like a fma light so if you havent watched it do if you have similar tastes to me what should i watch next bonus points for them being on netflix or amazon prime
anime,removed,aoty just give it already animecirclejerk
anime,removed,outside of torrents and xdcc via an irc client you wont find any way as far as i know legally we cant really direct you anywhere so youre likely going to have to google and sail the high seas is there a particular reason you cant use torrents
anime,removed,download anime doesnt involve torrent pick one

anime,removed,i dont normally think much about whats shown in ops and just enjoy the lightshow but now i know theres spoilers in the op thanks a lot
anime,removed,yu yu hakusho is about a deamon king who loses his powers and learns to become human by being a calous ass hole toward everyone overtime he grows apart from all his friends towards the end dies in a house fire but is brought back when his corpse is thrown in front of car
anime,removed,the childhood friend doesnt have one though i guess your point still stands nicoheart
anime,removed,anyone have suggestions for animes that feature characters that get extremely angry i really like fights where a character just goes berserk speaking of berserk ive seen that scene where guts tries to escape the demons teeth is awesome along with blue exorcist rin going a bit insane is cool and attack on titan erens transformation
anime,removed,well now its your fault for actually pointing out the spoilers to us anime only viewers
anime,removed,it literally took me seconds to google in the high seas

anime,removed,kirito is actually pretty badass irl luckily sao tells us that s implying yuuki isnt a bigger offender because of one thing she gets a free pass she literally dies i dont see how everything worked out for her tldr yuuki gets sympathy votes and is allowed to abuse shit kirito gets slammed for with little to no explanation yuuki isnt the main character kirito is better when he isnt the main character either neither of them would beare good main characters if yuuki was the main character i wouldnt have given her a free pass for being op but the biggest difference is while kirito seems to just pass by life doing whatever yuuki has a goal for her life what she wants to achieve in life kill that boss with her friends while they still have time kirito has none of this he just happens on a situation and then magically solves it with whatever was needed that time now youre just getting into the debate on if reki can right a decent romance or not he cant write one for shit no asuna is just a waifu bait blob of a character given action skills to make her seem badass sinon at least had some agency and independence imouto was just weird you also have to take into account the episode count given for a very small side story written much later compared to the main story written much earlier reki got better with dialogue but it was still forced and wooden even in the novels of fucking course the quality of writing matters a lot the writing is probably the most important thing in an anime good writing can carry bad direction and animation shinsekai yori being proof of this some episodes are just blatantly bad on a technical level why do i have to take into account anything doesnt matter when and who wrote it if the result is bad because the writer was bad back then and is now good doesnt make that previous result betterexcusable

anime,removed,the first half of the show was incredible but once biba showed up everything kind of went off the rails they really needed to do a better job of explaining how he made the logical leap from my dad betrayed me time to overthrow him to therefore unleash kabane on every human safe haven i can find i dont think ive ever said this before but i hope that if they end up making a sequel to this show they dont try to come up with an interesting villain and just give us more zombies
anime,removed,found a play list with it on youtube
anime,removed,oh yeah good point looks like he has the videos for the rest of them just not a part of the play list for the rest of them i guess lol
anime,removed,japanese cat noises
anime,removed,hd version just came out check out rnaruto for a good torrent link cant post it here its against the rules
anime,removed,it went from a man vs nature story line into a forced man vs man honestly they should have kept it a survival horror story and maybe foreshadowed biba or just the general political framework in the background as everything went to hell and set something up for a season
anime,removed,cat noises
anime,removed,
anime,removed,it would honestly be more weird for the girls not to crush on the teacher almost every girl entering hs tends to develop a crush or infatuation on a teacher just the way it goes add in he looks like a professional athlete and is especially nice to girls likely used to feeling like outcasts anyways i wouldnt expect the crush and secret jealously by hikari to stop any time soon but seeing the teacher deal with it in a responsible way is actually to me going to be the more interesting part of the show considering thats a hard line to walk when dealing with young women encouraging without sending the wrong signals
anime,removed,someone up for anime talk skype call no cam
anime,removed,you know the bermuda triangle right how a bunch of ships have disappeared around that area well turns out its a time machine

anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,when nagisa from clannad die i jump to the the episode if this is real
anime,removed,i wouldnt say i got offended but i just felt incredibly uncomfortable with the rapey scenes theres like or of them and the entire time my brain wasnt sure if it was wanting to be repulsed at the scenes or angry that the entire show was ruined for me because of the scenes
anime,removed,diamond is the last part that was animated it just finished a couple of weeks ago so now unless you want to wait for the next part to be animated hopefully it will you will have to read the manga httpswwwredditcomrstardustcrusaderswikimanga
anime,removed,there is technically a tournament during the hunter exam not that we see much of it
anime,removed,easiest would be to find that torrent again shouldnt be hard if you remember where you got it from

anime,removed,another nsfw post who wouldve guess taigasigh
anime,removed,they are all pretty different i like yanderes mostly because of ryoko asakura though tsunderes are good if pulled off right but most of them are shit like naru kuuderes have never been my favourite but i certainly dont dislike them deredere is pretty difficult to pull off right but the quality of a bad deredere is way better than a bad tsundere danderes are similar to kuuderes but maybe slightly below i dont like nagato that much sue me
anime,removed,it is another girl i think i heard it somewhere actually
anime,removed,killys goal was to find a human him being one is a pretty big change streamlining the narrative for the sake of a tighter movie plot is probably a good idea but well see

anime,removed,another week and i still didnt feel like watching much this season so after i finished my mawaru penguindrum rewatch last week i went and rewatched some more shinsakai yori savage hypocrisy the anime first time around i was dumbfounded at what was happening this time around i was predominately angry squeler was a hero humans are a bunch of assholes still a spectacular show occulticnine trying to focus on the mystery but i keep getting distracted by stupid shit like why is he called a neet he was in school dunno why i found the kiri kiri basara name to be a complete earache every time i heard it omg those nose contours so random appearing on many characters that i started to suspect if they were trying to convey something like a lie asimetrical twocolored clothes look so cool i want some are those tits getting bigger each episode
anime,removed,fategrand order with a little bit of help though not to mention most of the servants were blackened meaning emiya lost his eye of the mind and a couple other servants probably lost some of their personal skills

anime,removed,why the sudden name calling kindly fuck off this discussion was never yours to begin with

anime,removed,ay ukatsukibakugou
anime,removed,madoka from madoka magica is probably the most underrated character in the series when i hear people talk about her all i hear is that she takes too long to become a magical girl
anime,removed,i finished kokoro connect even though i quickly realised it wasnt for me it was partly because a friend had recommended it and partly because i wanted to know whowhat heartseed was and why it was fucking with the kids s i was disappointed
anime,removed,man these are so scarce now a days

anime,removed,sakurasou aka running stimulator not a masterpiece nanami didnt get chosen not mediocre misaki is one of my favourite genki characters kouhaikun is a pretty cool nickname that she came up with
anime,removed,httpimgurcomdvkabyx
anime,removed,here you and banned within minutes for having something other than a positive opinion
anime,removed,httpsiimgurcomdvkabyxjpg
anime,removed,this is technically shinobu and araragis theme hyouri is shinobus theme its the song bonds from the nisemonogatari soundtrack but yes it is my fav monogatari song and i feel it represents the despair thier relationship is full of nicely araragi died to save kissshot and through some event not yet shown in the anime they are bound together for life now and cant live without each other as a result and that means they will be together until the end of time until they are the last on this planet its a very sad and depressing song and i feel it represents the tone change of the monogatari series beautifully if youve seen only bakemonogatari or know of the woman of the week approach of bake but havent seen it thats only the introduction to the real story which begins to unfold in nisemonogatari the act if you would
anime,removed,to be fair it did have a couple of scenes involving motherdaughter incest
anime,removed,junko brainwashed the world with despair now s ryota is gonna brainwash the world with hope
anime,removed,is this the episode in which sakamoto is shown dead in a coffin
anime,removed,kaiki deishu and meme oshino i can imagine that as being something for the history books
anime,removed,hmm my idea of an entertaining presidential debate would involve candidates who actually capable of giving composed and insightful answers that narrows the options a bit httppsychopasswikiacomwikiakanetsunemori postmovie versus httphunterxhunterwikiacomwikimeruem before memory loss both are incredibly wise strongwilled experienced with facing adversity and familiar with philosophy and politics in their own way their viewpoints are relatively opposed to one another and reflecting that their campaigns would be wildly different
anime,removed,im not even sure why i should care about who the next person elected is i dont know what netero did before or what the hunter organization actually does
anime,removed,i love emilia
anime,removed,yes obito said that but in that fight kakashi added a third line something like and those who betray their comrades are even worse scum
anime,removed,easily the you will ever get best girlyukinoyukinoshita
anime,removed,bird sister is best sister
anime,removed,in food wars when nakiris pink haired assistant loses to hayama in the election tournament i had to rush for the extinguisher when he tells her i could never lose to someone whose ambition is to be someone elses
anime,removed,a little silly he says as they end up in a robot inside a robot inside a robot inside a robot bigger than the universe
anime,removed,those are more hand axes rather than a full two handed axe kirito could s dual wield two two handed swords because the game dev had a hardon for him
anime,removed,its not about mmo friends or fantasy fulfillment overlord is about great world building and destroying thats why it may have felt slow or focused on wrong details like the lizardmen arc was literally a whole book on lizardmen and then them getting stomped at the very end quite similar to other arcs too
anime,removed,ummm you mean shion right cz she was the one on the phone not mion
anime,removed,i can only recall s fights with them in the tower against the bad guys i cant remember the names the one who he is working for but i never saw her as someone who is interested in him romantically sooooo who are the others
anime,removed,ill concede that mayoiga has legitimately good parts like mcs backstory but it doesnt know if it wants to be a comedy or a legit mystery moments like s mc getting strength from seeing lovepons underwear and the whole burning at stake scene prevent me from taking the show seriously
anime,removed,honestly i cant stand rem and the reasons rezero has given to like the twins feels forced rem s brutally murders and tortures subaru to the point when he has mental breakdowns and im supposed to suddenly like her because s she held subarus hand while he slept
anime,removed,good point but i feel like everyone in the show has forgotten that katsuhira is apathetic about life and has no grasp on how feelings work this was shown in the first episode when he let those bullies steal from him and didnt understand why chidori cared s so when chidori ran away he just did what tenga told him and ran after her then when he does try to comfort chidori tenga beats the shit out of him anyway it was depressing for me to see a guy who was confused and trying to understand the situation getting assaulted by his friend
anime,removed,something i couldnt even get past and im incredibly jaded is this the one with the little girl who put cement in her eyes and the one where a little girl gets curbstomped by cops
anime,removed,you sure its not fuuka
anime,removed,just you wait until the third arc
anime,removed,well hes a trap so

anime,removed,i could be totally offbase here but ive been getting the impression that people who are closer to the sailor moon every life is important and we must do our best to save them all end of the spectrum are more likely to like this series than people who are closer to the cant think of a character example but its nice if i can save other people but im gonna look out for myself first end of the spectrum s simply because subaru is much closer to the former than the latter and people belonging to the latter end of the spectrum find it hardimpossible to relate to the main character tending to call him a white knight who cares more about his waifus than his life when in fact hes perfectly happy to risk his life for nonwaifus hes friends with too i personally think re zero is great its got a main character that i absolutely relate to he reacts in very similar way to how i think id react in similar situations although im physically not capable of doing so darn you people who exercise its got plenty of s suffering which im a huge fan of in my anime and its got fantasy elements which im also a huge fan of theres also some mystery and a great ending song and a pretty nice opening as well not that you get to see either as often as you might like

anime,removed,i assume you missed the episode where subaru realized that she s is willing to help complete strangers like that one lost girl even though she has her own problems that trump whatever petty issues they have seriously she loses an irreplaceable token of being that whole ruler candidate but shes still willing to sidetrack to lend a hand to other people

anime,removed,all the characters are critical examinations of their tropes toradora spoilers to follow do not read if you havent seen the show i wrote an article on the show but that was mostly me fawning over how well done the characters were although i did touch on this subject some taiga is the tsundere at the beginning of the show shes feared by everyone shes mean to everyone and she only acts dere dere very rarely and usually around yuusaku and the show gives a reason for her to behave this way she had a messed up family life which lead her to become afraid of getting attached to anyone which lashing out at everyone solved she didnt have to get attached as long as she put up the guise of a tiger even though she desperately craved love from someone ryuuji is the nice guy hes always helping everyone solve their own problems and seems to always know exactly what to say but the show flips that on him by making other characters point out that ryuuji has a lot of problems of his own and refuses to help himself because he doesnt want help from anyone else hes selfdestructing because he thinks everyone elses problems are more important than his own minori is the genki girl she brings a smile to everyones face she was taigas friend when no one else was but the show lets us see that its all a front for her insecurities and hypocrisy in wanting to maintain the status quo she doesnt want to confess to ryuuji because shes afraid the balance of the friendship will be thrown off so she puts up her genki girl front and tries to pretend like nothing is changing when everything clearly is kitamura is the reliable best friend hes responsible in the student council and everyone is in love with him but then the show goes and shows us how he struggles with accepting the responsibility because of the student council president in my opinion hes the least developed character though ami is the cool beauty all the girls aspire to be her and all the guys have a crush on her because shes a famous model but yet again the show lets us know that shes actually incredibly blunt and selfcentered looking out for her own interests even within the friend group shes tired of being treated like the mature adult in the room because it involves helping other people all the time which is something she cant avoid because she built up her persona around being that mature and responsible one so toradora is indeed a romcom but it takes every character archetype and looks at what their flaws are and why they would have come about in the first place and then it goes to its rational conclusion with those characters and thats why i love it
anime,removed,this show is so awesome but i feel like even mentioning the title is a spoiler in a thread like this not that you can do anything about it i watched it without knowing anything about it at all and really enjoyed the mystery after s megumi falls ill and no one knows why

anime,removed,i promise my anime will be better than both sao and boku no pico
anime,removed,i think fatezero is utterly boring and tends to attract the imsointelligentbecauseedgypoliticaldrama people this is why i liked ubw far more it felt more focused fights were much better and archer is hella more interesting than both the series combined also people who harp on shirous ideals are fucking morons because thats exactly what the anime tries to tell you that she is naive and idealistic and thats exactly why archer hates him so much and wants to end him out of shear hatred because he is him and hes lived through his ideal and just ended up becoming a pawn and a tortured soul and that plot twist was amazing to me

anime,removed,as some have pointed out this episode actually jumped the manga order so far weve skipped about chapters and shinomiya and mutsumis characterization that said were likely still getting them based on the va cast they probably just moved the chapters around but my shipper heart is crying out with joy this episode we see the introduction of new characters and the induction of shion into the hall of fame lol katchu ranbu is a reference to touken ranbu where swords turn into boys how appropriate both are in the same season this anime never stops with its references i love it i actually couldnt tell its him until i replayed that part several times he usually doesnt sound like that as an aside im honestly glad because hes getting typecast into the pretty boy idol sometimes shota role when i know he does have a range between this and hatsukoi monster hes getting more interesting roles we also got some animeoriginal scenes which are awesome that mutsumi forehead scene is original yay they actually made the whole katchu ranbu part more gay than the manga also i dont recall the iganana part in the manga so its probably also an original scene igarashi also became a bro this episode going out of his way to help shima and kae mend their relationship this is actually one of my favorite parts of this anime they may all be love rivals but theyre at the same time also friends and will look out for each other i cant wait to see more of the crew just being friends with each other as much as i want to see kae actually end up with somebody next episode will be the onsen episode yes that one you saw in the op as well as a bunch of other things heh it will be fun thats all i can promise

anime,removed,the only scene i can think of that fits this is the episode of rezero where subaru is trying to earn everyones trust after being killed multiple times he tries so hard at it that ends up coming off as completely out of place and even more suspicious than he was before the scene ends with him breaking down and emilia telling him itll be okay its probably the only subaru x emilia scene i enjoyed

anime,removed,can someone tell me why did haroma cried at iktas and yatoris conversation i couldnt quite grasp it alderamin on the sky
anime,removed,what a sad pathetic life you must have then
anime,removed,i am really happy they are adapting the next arc the next one is my favorite we get schierke and the berserker armor
anime,removed,wrong
anime,removed,oreshura i hated majority of the cast so i felt vindicated when best girl silver won at the end
anime,removed,i did immediately afterwards im glad it wrapped up the kurisuokabe romance and who darus future wife would be in one felt swoop it was a very heartwarming episode
anime,removed,okay i dont see the camera in the anime but i never understand this he literally confesses and in game theres a camera listening in to the conversation my narumitsu shipping ass fanboyed too hard at the tea scene edgeworth youve gotten stronger you were the one who taught me how shoe is best girl and her owner is best guy hes hot but an asshole ¯ツ¯ whatca gon do fucking hell that glare when matt speaks to phoenix omg my favorite part of this entire case fucking cross examining a walkie talkie i really cant wait for the final but then again i can the seriesll be over
anime,removed,i just recently finished at first glance itll not pass my three episode rule because it keeps repeating the same pattern it only got interesting at episode with his three dilemmas by episode it got me confused i thought he just joined all the clubs and the random references happened because of his multiple activities on those clubs but now hes a recluse stuck in a room that connects to other parallel scenarios at episode it seems to wrap up the story but leave me dissatisfied so what should i take out of this that opportunities are just dangling in front of you and its just waiting for you to grab it that upon merely grabbing them will end as being happily ever after i wish real life would be that simple the way things ended in the story seems to be too optimistic
anime,removed,that new scene with phoenix and edgeworth talking in his office was a great addition it worked really well even if it was a bit unsubtle kind of a bummer they skipped adrians whole story and just kinda made her a side character but i guess it had to get cut for time
anime,removed,its not translated in english unfortunately i did read some summaries and saw some images from the ln that showed s kanie and sento confessing to each other i think i think it was on theres a manga translated somewhere it only translated to the latest chapter i think where it shows s sento liking kanie but not telling him sorry for not being much of a help
anime,removed,i do and as someone who has read ot im just saying your speculation is wrong
anime,removed,according to the end s foreskin appeared p
anime,removed,watching that fight with daryun and then being told silver mask was koichi was very shocking
anime,removed,salvation happened in every route of the vn including terra it just took different forms theres no saving earth from destruction
anime,removed,s no shes not best girl but i just mean i never heard a single good thing said about her everyone despised her for what she does but i think its perfectly understandable and in some ways defensible
anime,removed,ideon id argue on ideon that the show starts to pick up around episode or so so its not as bad as waiting until the halfway mark of the show those first episodes are for the most part pretty brutal with how slow they are but once we hit episode things pick up and the plot goes a lot quicker the rest of the way i think the need to satisfy sponsors goes on throughout unfortunately a necessity of all tomino shows from this era i suppose as even later in the show we get into a trend of new enemy characters and mecha that only show up for an episode or two but if one can get beyond that its a really good show and is especially good in the ideon be invoked movie which id say is a must watch for any mecha anime fan id also say that tominos zambot which predates ideon by or years does a great job at showing the darker side of scifi said show is truly one of the first mecha anime deconstruction shows rather than lauded on as heroes our main characters are blamed for the destruction caused by their battles and blamed for the alien invasion taking place in the show the show is also the originator of a notable tomino trope that is probably more well known in ideon s the kill em all ending
anime,removed,at least togamexshichika vs seisuzu wouldve made me salty in a good way
anime,removed,you can only understand her in terra where you learned of her interest in computers through kotarou then she has a role in the ending becoming one of the apostles to deliver his message to the world
anime,removed,excellent summary upon rewatch i noticed asukas actions might be inconsistent with her later s refusal to partake in the reaudition drama because right now shes taking an active role smoothing out discontent one consistent trait about her is that she despises drama but maybe the storys trying to highlight harukas unease with dealing with group conflict
anime,removed,to be fair tomino slaughters everyone left and right p i think he gives respectable treatment to women in many of his shows see the treatment characters like haman karn emma sheen and dianna soriel get i can see the criticism at victory though s all shrike team members are basically there to get slaughtered usos mother has the most gruesome death in gundam right in front of him lupes a pedophile katejina is one of most hatable characters in the franchise and shakti is one of the most frustrating characters gundam has ever seen with how much of a delusional idiot she is marvet is a strong character at least i understand that tominos got his tropes and styles and isnt for everyone
anime,removed,this season isnt the same as any other ive seen since ive been watching airing anime its gay as fuck too things dont always fall into the same pattern like you want them to sure people will hate and like different things no fucking shit sherlock but the numbers is what makes it different

anime,removed,i can explain it when it comes to america the law americans dont pirate movies and music as much as anime when you look at percentages of watchedpaid for not whole numbers because they can get sued for it almost nobody gets sued for pirating anime the few rare exceptions are with hugely popular licenses series like one piece theres no real risks in pirating anime which ruins any chance of the market succeeding they can take down pirate bay a dozen times kickasstorrents torrentzeu but anime still gets pirated all the time

anime,removed,shows like durarara is that really an example you want to use mikado is supposed to look everyday but for a very specific reason he is not its what makes his dollars reveal in ep work and his character arc in the sequel seasons hes a wolf in sheep cloths i dont think his dark turn is supposed to be relatable exactly

anime,removed,tenjou utena revolutionary girl utena i admire her selflessness and dedication to helping others but what makes her my favorite all time character is that s she came from such a place of despair when her parents died but broke out of it with nothing but a mission to save someone she didnt even know who was suffering even worse than she was i also like how human she is when she falls for akio but ultimately she overcomes that to save her friend hajime saito rurouni kenshin his laid back demeanour with his flawless dedication to his ideals is just the picture of cool he is efficient focused and totally unrelenting but still appreciates a good fight maka soul eater i like the mix of a mentally strong character who is also really sweet and very human her compassion for s crona sets her apart from similar characters kiritsugu fatezero this guy might be the coldest good guy ive ever seen he is immaculately cool but s he is forced to come to terma with his humanity eventually and that just made him way more relatable mikasa attack on titan skilled dedicated seemingly emotionless characters are my jam but what puts mikasa above the others is how she reacts to s losing her only purpose in erin she literally cannot give up and moves past her erin obsession to recognize that she wants to protect everyone
anime,removed,whos emilia
anime,removed,geo you might want to check his toolbox tag kek
anime,removed,so theyre finally confirming lelouch did not die hell yeah thats great news
anime,removed,roughly translated recap movies coming jan new anime unconfirmed whether full tv series or ovafilm but its coming for sure lelouch is alive the original staff are returning for the most part
anime,removed,even if he lives can we not shit on the people assuming he died considering he seemingly was stabbed with a blade into the chest and at the same time if he died can we not shit on the people saying he lived lelouch is a cunning bastard it was not entirely unreasonable to assume he would even fake his own death honestly both options are perfectly reasonable and its probably not worth renewing this discussion considering its originally left up to interpretation to a huge degree
anime,removed,ending scene bro he never died

anime,removed,since that first post got taken down id like to sincerely say fuck you to all those bastards who argued that lelouch was dead through all these years all hail lelouch
anime,removed,attack of the titanes is already the classic it is the only best anime in the world everr
anime,removed,but hes alive or not
anime,removed,i knew it so many people believed he was dead despite the evidence
anime,removed,im guessing removed cause of all the untagged spoilers to be fair though look at that title it should be expected
anime,removed,i hope he really does get resurrected the entire end of is completely pointless if he planned for himself to survive
anime,removed,you can make a reasonable assumption from lelouch of the resurrection kinda takes away that surprise
anime,removed,yes i knew he was alive
anime,removed,are u fucking retarded
anime,removed,it wasnt open he was clearly alive and immortal code bearer
anime,removed,kys
anime,removed,theres still the problem of the title implying spoilers perhaps a new post with just code geass announced
anime,removed,yeah the problem might be the title for someone who might have started code geass this will ruin the experience i kinda hate it to search for anime series character name with google the thing that appears are the tons of youtube death videos could have understood it for the topic but this topic also have the same name
anime,removed,your mod friend isnt very clear at all in his reasoning post
anime,removed,lol i know the series is a bit old but that title is a little spoilerish maybe you should have put the the title in the text of the post
anime,removed,the problem with this is we therefore cannot ever have a discussion thread when it airs because the anime name itself is a spoiler im all for preventing spoilers but when the creators use a spoiler in the name for a series that last ended almost a decade ago this rule is just a little bit silly in this case
anime,removed,theyre gonna ruin that perfect ending now to pander to people who think hes still alive arent they
anime,removed,i feel like lelouch being alive cheapens his sacrifice at the end of
anime,removed,all these years i have been saying lelouch didnt die all hail lelouch
anime,removed,but he died what is this anarchy
anime,removed,so i guess he was alive after all
anime,removed,for the people that think lelouch is dead watch this
anime,removed,im thinking some type of witch probably resurrects him or maybe manipulates time i dont think it would be cc though
anime,removed,ill just quote myself from the discussion weeks before even if some people love the ending code geass is nothing without lelouch i really dont care how much people say it would ruin the ending of season if they decide to bring it back they also will need him back and lelouch of the resurrection with this title i think they thought the same anyway fuck yes i cant wait
anime,removed,spoilerswell at the end was talking to lelouch in the hay cart he died and super star as well as become the wreckage for all the hate humanity had toward him spoilers
anime,removed,its absolutely ridiculous cant talk about code geass season content in a thread about a potential season but you can go fap to the corpses of dead girls without a problem at rcutegirlcorpses
anime,removed,shit so the cart driver really was lelouch after all
anime,removed,finally i can see ma boy lelouch show all of you he didnt die a virgin
anime,removed,i realize what happened i just feel like there is a massive difference between sacrificing yourself to save the world and change it for the better vs becoming immortal and tricking the world into thinking you died so that it would turn out the way you want it from a writing standpoint lelouch giving his life is a much better end to his characters story
anime,removed,but but the ending was already perfect and lelouch was dead i mean wtf please dont ruin the series for your milking please if it turns out a generic mecha shit ill just pretend it doesnt exist
anime,removed,cart driver theory was right
anime,removed,is this the continuation of the series where lelouch died or just stories for midseries again
anime,removed,what theyre gonna kill him again theres like other elseworld code geass stories out there why not that
anime,removed,lelouch lives
anime,removed,it might be a continuation of homura character arc i dont think homura as she is at the end of the anime would behave as she does in the movie but i believe this part to be highly subjective but it is a fanservice cashgrab movie too there is no other reason for the idiotic other girls are also part of the law of cycles along madoka cause they needed an excuse to bring them back law of cycles having actual physical form she only has one in the transitional period before the universe is fully reshaped in the anime and dont even get me started on bebe
anime,removed,never showed him receiving the code as far as we know it never actually happened it is simply implied with the fact hes not alive im saying that from a writing standpoint it definitely cheapens lelouchs sacrifice when he doesnt actually die at the end its like if obi wan came back to life at the end of a new hope like lol nevermind i lived cause the force allows me to survive or clint eastwood surviving the final shootout at the end of gran torino because the bullets miraculously missed vital organs or something a good character sacrificing themselves for the sake of something greater loses its cathartic feel when the character doesnt actually sacrifice anything
anime,removed,sure no trainwreck at the end ohgi gets to be prime minister of japan after he betrayed zero and hes the one fucking a britannian agent and colluding with a britannian prince cornelia is a known war criminal that mows down civilians ruthlessly and she gets a fucking happy ending too the amount of bullshit is too much in your safe landing there
anime,removed,its not that hard to find someone to take on your immortality after youre done with it having the code isnt exactly anything all that bad just keep it til youre done with it and pass it on ez pz the sacrifice is definitely cheapened suzaku is forced to face the burden he was left with first of all hed be forced to face this regardless of whether lelouch was alive or not secondly no one cares about suzaku he defeated his father who has code while having both geass eyes unlocked thats what code is code is being immortal being immune to geass the code isnt having both eyes turned into geass what nothing about lelouchs fight with his father involved lelouch attaining the geass
anime,removed,so ledouche is back
anime,removed,he should have stayed dead
anime,removed,hes alive
anime,removed,he was the driver of the cart on the last episode i want to call everyone who made fun of me for saying so
anime,removed,yes at around minutes there is a end of movie spoiler
anime,removed,please dont do grave robbing
anime,removed,well it tells us that lelouch died so as a person that believed that he was still alive they already ruined the ending for me
anime,removed,😭but but but but ll is dead perfect endingruined haha you idiots told you he wasnt dead even with the clues right in front of your face your ignorance is comical and pathetic now drown in those tears quiver lips🤣
anime,removed,they also confirmed that nunnaly was dead thats why the cart theory is so enduring the creators cant be trusted
anime,removed,did lelouch have that immortality shit like cc or his father or did he really die in the end
anime,removed,i just hope they pull it off im kinda hoping for one of two things either he survived through some rediculously convoluted series of events that take an entire episode to explain or he just shows up and everyones like didnt you die nope and no further detail is ever given
anime,removed,not even about the hype lelouch living completely destroys his requiem the only ones who should kill are those who are prepared to be killed thats one of the strong points of the ending as well whats the point of that quote if not even lelouch went through with it
anime,removed,bbut lelouch won at the end of season what else could he fight
anime,removed,asking people to spoiler tag the title when the creators themselves specifically chose that title knowing full well what it means what are you smoking as much as i appreciate your and the other mods work dont overdo it please or its getting very close to censoring
anime,removed,musubi was that drink mitsuha made while performing remember and taki drank it to sync their timelines in that cave
anime,removed,no more shogun kayo tt
anime,removed,i hope season is just cc and lelouch riding around in a cart that way itll basically spice and wolf season and a a code geass continuation at the same time everyone wins
anime,removed,no they said lelouch is kill at the end
anime,removed,i bet the big ending reveal is its not actually lelouch but another geass user pretending to be llelouch
anime,removed,i called it years ago lelouch lives
anime,removed,they better not make the cart rider canon
anime,removed,s i feel like that confirms the cart theory then especially with a time skip
anime,removed,oh shit i did not expect to see slacks here and definitely not with a logical argument for an alive lelouch
anime,removed,code geass has never been too worried about spoiling itself it has episode titles like bloody euphemiasp and emperor lelouchsp and zero requiemsp
anime,removed,well lelouch of the resurrection doesnt sound very good kinda ruins the ending of the prequel
anime,removed,clannad after story made me cry like a bitchthe testosterone just got obliterated with that one lol ohhh and merrys death from one piece surrounded me with quite the onions as well
anime,removed,buthes not dead p
anime,removed,why is nunnaly blind again
anime,removed,story was better with him dead
anime,removed,yoake mae yori ruriiro na crescent love ep would have dismissed this had it not been recommended so far i like it maybe a a bit too sillychildish at times but still interesting for me mawaru penguindrum ep had high hopes for this one but so far its average do like the soundtrack especially the first opening but considering ive heard it mentioned alongside zetsuen no tempest often its still not catching me lodosstou senki episode not enough to make up my mind on it yet but so far pretty underwhleming ginga eiyuu densetsu logh episode seems like it will be good lets see how it goes spice and wolf ova and specials ova was excellent may be my favourite episode in the series certainly has the standout scene for me s the imagined scene where lawrence fades in time after holo turns back to him losing sight of other wolves special was fun but special was bad kino no tabi the beautiful world episode could have been great is well written and atmospheres are done well but cant personally get into an anime s there is one character getting most the focus and they are apathetic might be the wrong word he does obviously show concern and such and theres a nice moment in episode but i would prefer more liveliness from a single character showsorry hermes

anime,removed,only day left to read in the heavens feel route to finish it day was incredible s i dont even know where to start shirou and kirei team up was pretty great loved it when shirou jumped out the window after rescuing illya only because kirei did and then kirei asks him if hes suicidal s it was cool to see shirou sort of using unlimited blade works in this route taking out alter berserker was unexpected and then the kirei battle against assassin and zoukenwow i really like kirei now after this route but i was expecting him to die in that battle i dont know what they are possibly going to do with him on this last day and evil sakura is surprisingly hot s finally illyas story of angra mainyu id already seen zero but i dont remember that series explaining with detail what was really going on with the grail it was really interesting origin story for avenger they just picked him to respect all the evil in the world and tortured him his entire life no wonder he wants to destroy humanity i really cant wait to see how this final battle is going to go
anime,removed,well you know what they say you can polish and spray cologne on a piece of shit but in the end its still a piece of shit aha guess thats why you fulfill your sexual urges through hentai and ecchi i truely wish from the bottom of my heart you fix yourself one day p
anime,removed,hibikis father akira tachibana from symphogear first two seasons have flashbacks and keywords saying hes a deadbeat drunk who probably beat his family and when he shows up in hes a failure working at a conbini they keep forcefully trying to mend hibiki and akiras relationship throughout the season up until episode where he risks his life to save her and we find out he gave her the catchprase heiki hecchara its okay everythings fine when she was young sounds great except for the fact he used heiki hecchara to justify everything he did and hibiki and her mom are supposed to immediately forgive him and try and mend the family after years of having him walk out getting bullied at school having bricks thrown through her houses windows being called a murderer etc in fact hibiki basically forces her mother to forgive him even though he most likely beat the shit out of her a few times and left the fucking family fuck this subplot holy shit kanekoooooooooooooooooooooo

anime,removed,
anime,removed,whitefox shuffled some of the events in the past episodes but at this point some scenes are confirmed axed in the anime here are some important ones subaru actually had a magic talk with roswal in the bath scene they probably axed that one because of the puck scene but what they didnt cover is that beatrice is a master of the yin magic and that subaru have absolutely no talent in magic last loop subaru refuses to eat and at some point emilia spoon fed him
anime,removed,tenga said he wants to hear whether his confession is rejected or not so chidori will feel a weight lifted off i think she got angry because s kacchon hugged her because she wanted to not because he wanted to so of course shell be angry when someone wants to do something for her sake tenga isnt doing it for himself hes doing it for her which angers her because it reminds her what kacchon did i love chidori and out of all the characters she has suffered the most from emotional pain and i love how complex of a character she became shes selfish and i love that before she was seen as a kind character and she still is but when she gets overwhelmed with emotions she becomes selfish because she cares more about her emotions than someone else

anime,removed,man you have no idea how dangerous he could be lol
anime,removed,
anime,removed,why are you mad though
anime,removed,that makes him a selfpromoter as defined by sitewide reddit rules httpswwwredditcomwikiselfpromotion
anime,removed,eh airencracken kind of threatened him with video blacklisting at that point is it fair to assume that he was probably afraid of any response that he wouldve gotten from any moderator
anime,removed,and stated his intent to continue breaking them man you guys make shit up as you go along first it was that he isnt giving any signs he wont follow the rules now its that he actively has shown intent to continue breaking them oh and digibro is the only youtuber who is not allowed to comment on only his videos since he got banned the first time everyone else is allowed to do that theres never any point debating with you guys either ive never seen the mod team make a decision and then reverse it although that may be confirmation bias at play
anime,removed,this is what i find funny about the whole thing the mods here are supposed to be a mediator to try and make the subreddit the best place it can be for us who browse it but whenever a mod comments on digibro and why hes banned they get downvoted into oblivion it seems clear that the vast majority of us here either dont care about his content being posted or spammed being neutral or we generally enjoy it while i understand that they have to enforce the rules it seems as though digibro is going to be promoted here whether he is banned or not and at this point seems a little shitty to keep him banned from even contributing comments to this community im a mild browser of this subreddit though so i dont really know all the drama
anime,removed,he doesnt follow the percent rule about not commenting according to the mods thats allowed for everyone except for digibro since hes currently banned for that initial selfpromotion
anime,removed,just when i think reddit mods cant be anymore petty and childish they do something like this
anime,removed,dude looks like simon from adventure time
anime,removed,i dont really have a dog in this so dont care too much but what rule the ratio thing is a reddiquette and not exactly a rule the same set of rule that tells people to dont downvote things they disagree on but majority still do also im looking at his account and he posts lots of comments obviously on his own sub but still it means hes following the rule where hes not just spamming videos
anime,removed,but that isnt what this is about and youre now going strawman really shows your comprehension and the lack of care of being a fair moderator of the subreddit its a shame you guys dont really care enough and continue to have him banned for lifetime if you wished for the better of this subreddit then you can unban him and open up a dialogue in this forum between creator and consumer i guess mods are truly biased in some cases and this is one of them
anime,removed,how petty do have to be to be a dick on the smallest of platform you have a little power over
anime,removed,not to mention that they then threatened to ban his videos being posted on ranime just because he tried to discuss with them getting unbanned
anime,removed,you let glassreflection do it so why is it a problem when digibro does this hell his account exists solely to comment his content that gets posted here if youre going to take what digibro said at face value he also said he was going to comment on other content here gr doesnt even do that i dont even want to see gr banned either but at least have some consistency
anime,removed,careful bro theyll get you too
anime,removed,except this is utterly dumb hes not allowed to post here because he doesnt do stuff thats not self promotion on reddit ok i get it needs to follow the reddiquette except he doesnt do stuff thats not self promotion on reddit cause hes not allowed to post here what would be the worst that could happen if you guys unbanned him for a trial period or something if all he did was comment on his own videos then yeah fine all hes trying to do is self promote but if he is actually commenting and discussing on other stuff then hed be following the rule perfectly fine based on how literally every comment the mods are posting in this thread is getting downvoted to all hell clearly no one besides you all defend this position youve taken
anime,removed,you suck as a mod admitting your wrong is the best way to show yourself as a great community leader sounds like your a terrible community leader
anime,removed,he would posting in other threads on ranime if he were unbanned here his rant suggests to me otherwise but ya well never know
anime,removed,as a passerby to your subreddit boo i am actively and respectfully booing at you people like his work and are linking to it anyway so why not let the kid be if you wanted to be fair you could set up a thread to discuss this with the community maybe this has already occurred as i said im just a passerby that enjoyed the video and dont understand your reasoning
anime,removed,authors do book signings because its a way to push their sales in that regard you are right its selfpromotion but content creators can only interact with people that have already watched their content you cant really promote your stuff to someone that has already consumed it can you now i get where youre coming from more comments more traction on youtube but that doesnt work on reddit commenting on your own stuff doesnt really push your content up now im not saying he deserves special treatment because hes big on youtube he broke the rules he got banned its all fair but that was a long time ago for one and saying that you wont unban him because all he wants is to interact with people that watch his videos really doesnt make any sense
anime,removed,exactly i feel like im the only one besides the mods who want him to stay banned we dont need some youtuber spamming his videos all over the sub the guy comments in places his own sub just about him his own videos that he himself posted to ranime that in my mind makes him seem only concerned with selfpromotion and not a productive member of the community here
anime,removed,i think my interpretation i agree with your interpretation i did not see people brigading threads that have nothing to do with his bannedstatus before his so called rant however it doesnt matter how you or i interpret it his fanbase is strictly stuck to the idea that hes the ultimate good in this scenario he didnt know he wont do it again youre just making there are numerous numerous cases here of whataboutism and other fallacies the biggest one being ad populum no matter if logic or the reddit sitewide rules are on your side they dont care they just want their youtuber unbanned
anime,removed,have other reviewers had this issue or do they just let other people post their stuff
anime,removed,your a bad moderator
anime,removed,how is him regularly providing stuff to talk about not contributing to the community do you even realise what you say
anime,removed,feels nice insulting people with an angry mob behind you doesnt it at least try to be decent
anime,removed,there isnt a reddit wide rule concerning self promotion reddiquite or however the fuck you spell that made up word is guidelines on how you should use reddit how do you know he doesnt have another account for everything else reddit most relatively popular youtubers do so they dont get bombarded with messages its ignorant and a show of what little power you have to ban someone over guidelines not rules guidelines noone else follows those guidelines but apparently you are too self important to admit your faults
anime,removed,if i remember correctly the mc isnt dense he avoids them on purpose its been quite a while since i last watched it so i could be wrong
anime,removed,it would be really cool if you would comment about the video itself in a discussion thread about the video
anime,removed,not everyone has the free time or the interest to be browsing and active on several different subreddits id say there are probably a lot of people on reddit who only ever visit one or two niche subreddits and never think about reddit as a whole
anime,removed,okay but when his videos get posted on here anyway exactly what is the point of this rule doesnt matter if youre the only mod with this reasoning its stupid and irrational
anime,removed,weve chosen to use the guideline as stated we strive to consistently apply this to everyone its not fair to the general population of the subreddit if we selectively apply the rules however ive yet to see anyone suggest that we consider changing the selfpromotion rule theres nothing prideful stubborn or petty about us consistently enforcing the rules youre free to disagree with me there but ive yet to hear anyone give me a concrete argument for selectively enforcing the rules
anime,removed,it would be really cool if digibro could comment on this he can so can you too actually rdigibro
anime,removed,he hasnt stated anything of the sort he cant participate in the sub since you banned him

anime,removed,even after an exchange of rings and the promise of marriage after winning gold some people will still say yuri ans victor are just best friends acting all gay for the lols because in ep theyre waiting for the revelation that this was just a fanfiction written by an obsessed fan and yuri is actually married to yuko in real life
anime,removed,i love emilia no but seriously i found subarus speech about how low he thinks of himself quite humbling it sort of reminded me of myself
anime,removed,hahaha studying for finals i tried and it just didnt work my motivation gave out at the worst time at least i have my good grades from the rest of my semester to cushion me haikyuu is my most recent favorite show and id probably remove coach ukai so i wouldnt have to feel the pain of his va passing away haikyuu was the only show ive seen him in but his voice acting was so good i always think back to the one scene at the end of where he tells them to eat and grow stronger

anime,removed,ayyy durarara is in there good taste but if youre looking for something lighthearted try air youll probably cry at the end though just a warning
anime,removed,in my defense her ass is really fine
anime,removed,anime is trash
anime,removed,uncalled for
anime,removed,best girl dies episodes into the show
anime,removed,i honestly just like nothing about the ending the killer lack of explanation for revival pretty much feeling completely rushed and kayo and him not ending together sure you cant really knock it down for that last point but when both of them together is the titular image of the series i cant help but feel disappointed especially with all the growth they gave each other
anime,removed,i thought combating entropy was a pretty good reason
anime,removed,theyre just mascots without a show together though trigger the redhead showed up in space patrol luluco

anime,removed,amagi brilliant park swhen kayne started crying when he saved the park like not a single anime really has gotten me emotional before but the feeling behind the tears and and his face so real honeslty if i watched it again i would probably cry
anime,removed,but thats later
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,pretty sure haruhi and kyon did and i know for a fact that nibutani x dekomori happened
anime,removed,good point hard to talk and play twister at the same time
anime,removed,pls dont do this to me
anime,removed,yo shut up
anime,removed,alphonse elric from suisei no gargantia
anime,removed,savage k i now know
anime,removed,well i thought about it and im now pretty content of how the show ended s by leaving that scene out they can start season with a bang since rem wont be in season at all aside from flash backs having that scene at the beginning of the season is like big emotional anchor for the viewers
anime,removed,whos that
anime,removed,the arc is so heavily emilia youll be asking whos rem
anime,removed,i read on batoto
anime,removed,hibike euphonium spoilers can be summed up with that one word s yuribait and we thank kyoani for that
anime,removed,pls tell me that bermuda triangle thing was a joke tt my immersion
anime,removed,the manga used the exact same explanation
anime,removed,i think that scene wanted to show how naho became seriously paranoid of kakeru killing himself that she thinks every little slightly unusual thing comes off to her as a sign of kakerus depression sure its painful to watch still but at least has some realistic basis also read it in another discussion that while it is a bit tragic the show is trying to show that some peoples characters nahos extreme shy and denseness are so deeply rooted in her that the only way she could change is kakeru dying and hence becoming the naho whod be able to write the latter thatd say that unfortunately kakerus death is needed for nahos development
anime,removed,just a side note a garden of words character also makes an appearance in kimi no na wa when you watch it i think youll know who it is right away
anime,removed,bland self insert overpowered mc check tentacle rape check incest sister check completely drops danger factor in second arc check asuna in a bird cage check asspull return from death check
anime,removed,wow im not a scrubby casual but i wouldnt be able to sit through a no voice movie unless if it had an amazing soundtrack httpsnpredditcomrareyoudeafbot
anime,removed,id say reigen from mob psycho i think hes easily the worst part of the show and would love to see how mob reacts to his death
anime,removed,why she decided to steal subarus heart rem chose ours
anime,removed,there are some fansubs on kissanime alright for a fansub but its pretty low in quality like you should watch it if youre desperate enough
anime,removed,thoughts on victory gundam episode httpiimgurcomfxgkhshjpg still no changes great to see the activity picking up here the last couple of days this last set of episodes really deserves it is shakti really gonna buy this crap she probably will knowing her cronicle must be part of this rebellion if tassilos willing to let her go over to his ship about time cronicle and katejina return shaktis already given the okay to being used as the core of the angel halo so says fuala but shakti tells cronicle to destroy it not as bad as i thought katejina gets to fulfill what is probably the desires of many as she knocks shakti out shutting her up juca and marvets dialogue is heavily implying that she is pregnant for real tassilo wants to pretend his ship is in danger but kudos to marvet co for actually endangering it for real so the angel halo truly does have a big effect now impacting those on the earth why destroy the angel halo when you can use it for yourself tassilo its like hes being a gasp good guy maria is finally told the truth but she still doesnt believe it the angel halo will reduce everyone to having the mind of babies tassilos plans of having cronicle on his side will probably go up in smoke by taking his sister captive part of me wonders if he was ever on his side and hes essentially trading shakti for maria here not really a good trade if shakti can control the angel halo better than maria could fuala calls uso a cute boy dont tell me shes another lupe cliffhanger ending dqotd well its not much of a surprise in this episode since they hinted to it earlier it feels a little bit old hat to me because glemmy did basically the same exact thing in gundam zz which was the last full length gundam tv series i think they tried to go to the opposite side of the spectrum glemmy was too goofy for a while while tassilo is too serious and not as interesting a character as a result that said it was interesting to note that his intentions here actually seem pretty good as he wants to stop the angel halo and reveals what it is really doing favorite superweapon none other than the angel halo here for the reason that its arguably the most powerful the most horrifying and the most unique since its not just another giant laser
anime,removed,check it out
anime,removed,what i can see how the anime is lightheated but dark maybe that one scene where yuki suggested a test of courage that was pretty scary however the rest of the anime was pretty cheerful especially how shovelkun miki and yuuri kept pretending that megumi didnt exist that was funny
anime,removed,you call someone else retarded but this comment shows that youre highly autistic
anime,removed,
anime,removed,he loves rem just as much as emilia in arc of the web novel subaru says it to emilia
anime,removed,nah mate i will be one of the few who will be happy that its finally over
anime,removed,how because then i dont have to watch it anymore and stay classy boys downvotes for that kind of comment brilliant but nothing id not expect from you fanboys
anime,removed,see my edit
anime,removed,youd absolutely love megumi kato from saekano but hate everything else about the show
anime,removed,reading is not your strong suit is it
anime,removed,only if you are a faggot
anime,removed,its called experience watching different genres and kinds of anime opens up way more possibilities to talk about the medium in general i dont want to praise what i love constantly i want to criticise things i dont like as well and id love to hate on the show every chance i get but that wouldnt be very good since all the time i put into writing is wasted due to this onslaught of downvotes because people cant take a hit
anime,removed,oh they sure do downvote me for my opinion just got to look at the difference in votes when in a thread where criticism is allowed and then one where it isnt this ones the latter
anime,removed,good its about time then
anime,removed,i somewhat want to agree but rem has died for subaru and also freely told him he should not settle for her and pursue emilia that puts her above in my opinion
anime,removed,ringo would have met his match against the unstoppable ken oyanagi
anime,removed,interesting it looks like they might actually be cutting some characters out entirely s specifically her mom notice on the bridge scene s the notebook falls in from a breeze as the two of them tussle over it instead of because her mom threw it in
anime,removed,interesting it looks like they might actually be cutting some characters out entirely or at least significantly decreasing their rolesignificance s specifically her mom notice on the bridge scene s the notebook falls in from a breeze as the two of them tussle over it not because her mom threw it in
anime,removed,well he does want to get rid of all the incompotent ppl and the way the empire has been handling things but he wants to do it in a way that is acceptable probably and that is why its a shame they havent showed the scene with the princess yet wich already happend in the mange when she left before they were sent to the front because that will give you information about the future of this show
anime,removed,most of the episode im okay im okay everyones okay the end i am not okay
anime,removed,fans of shokugeki search shokugeki ova english sub on daily motion the same can be done for ova ova is a fun side adventure and ova has interesting character building
anime,removed,so im a little worried about this prediction of the ending of the ln or maybe even the anime of re zero when everything is done and he wins subaru will die and wake up in front outside of the gas station where he was originally taken from
anime,removed,if the author doesnt want the work to bomb hell find a way of getting some science that works to resuscitate a cryogenic stasis body hopefully he doesnt pull an akame ga kill and kill off just about everyone worth caring about
anime,removed,im still confused about evangelion like the main characters pretty damn whiny and annoying so thats not so great thats not good at all but ya know you get past that and its just every episode being a new angel of the week to kill and theyre all different kinds of monsters requiring different tactics so thats cool thats fun to watch and the show continues like that for a while and you get into that but then it goes weird and you start to wonder whats going on whos at the helm here and it turns out its this guy whos having a mental breakdown and hes having it in this anime and you have to watch it happen and thats weird cause before it was just this typical mecha show with monsters of the week to kill but man something happened something happened and it turned the wrong way and the stuff thats on the periphery doesnt really register i dont know what the second impact was they mention it but i certainly cant recall what it meant and i dont know what the first impact was either maybe thats when the asteroid hit the dinosaurs maybe maybe its when adam and eve left the garden of eden who knows i dont know i dont know if anybody watching the show will know its very mysterious the spear of longinus is a giant mechsized spear in this show originally it was a roman soldiers spear that he stabbed jesus with here its giant and stuck into eve what does it all mean i dunno i dont know what any of this means it doesnt look like a roman soldiers spear how could it be maybe the roman soldier was actually an angel in this universe is that possible i dont know maybe hideaki anno knows he might know maybe roman soldiers were all angels maybe roman soldiers used to be roman but ended up being computer viruses cause an angel can be a computer virus in this show i dunno how a giant monster thing ended up as a computer virus but it happened does that make sense i dunno it doesnt seem like it makes sense but maybe it does and im just stupid maybe and the angels theyre protected by at fields that makes them like super tough and hard to kill but whats an at field its some sort of a force field but i never figured out what at was until i looked up an eva wiki it said at stood for absolute terror so the angels have an absolute terror field huh i dont know what that means i guess the angels are pretty scary its kinda scary that a giant monster is invading the city er the city that is above a hidden underground city thats sunken in for some reason but i dunno if theyre causing absolute terror that seems a little hyperbolic i think that might be somewhat overstated shinjis father is making something called a human instrumentality project i think i know what some words in that mean i know what a human is i know what a project is but gosh darnit i dont know what instrumentality means i got good grades in english class ive got a college degree but instrumentality is a real stumper its stumped me so i went to look it up in the dictionary the definition says the fact or quality of serving as an instrument or means to an end agency huh well okay so this project is somehow about humans serving as an instrument well okay thats pretty meaningless and doesnt really clarify things thats still really mysterious but the human instrumentality project mustve worked somehow because everybody turned into orange liquid at the end of the movie i guess thats how humans can serve as an instrument or a means to an end i guess orange liquid is an instrument its all rather confusing im not sure if people really have agency as liquid pools thats hard to understand i dont feel like that was really adequately explained to the audience
anime,removed,its the snails right its gotta be the snails
anime,removed,tune in next week for when rohan punches a child in the face
anime,removed,as a fan of sappy romance ive got to say their list is really weak toradora as the most recommended romance really where is itzura na kiss say i love you itzura na kiss kare kano bokura ga ita lovely complex oregairu has very little romance and in the end they all decide to just be friendssince when is cardcaptor sakura a romance is that really the best they could come up with knowing that it makes me very much doubt the rest of the list such as the horror hellsing beserk parasite and claymore arent scary even in the manga higurashi is scary if youre there is a difference between violence and horror i prefer corpse party because it is basically what higurashi was going for but actually pulls it off however if youre looking for true horror of the kind never seen before nor since watch boku no pico lastly evangelion madoka magica and re zero are deconstruction anime of their respective tropes evangelion breaks down the problem with throwing a teenager into a mecha and telling him to pilot it with little to no training it would break the mind of a kid telling himher to go from a normal high school life to piloting a robot in death battles and telling them that the fate of the world relies on their victoryfull grown adults commonly suffer ptsd you think a teenager would process it better and that is exactly what happens madoka magica tells what would actually happen to a year old if you told them to suddenly become a magical girl and have them to fight to the death by the end of that anime do any of them look sane kyuubey is the villain and people dont even realize it because it would take a twisted mind to tell young girls here are some powers now go fight monsters until you die then ill find someone else when you finally lose but people dont realize because we are so used to the animal assistant always present in magical girl anime finally rezero describes exactly how useful a real otaku would be in a fight in a lot of anime the otaku is transported to a new world and suddenly becomes the hero fighting everyone and saving the day in reality an otaku cant fight and he would die very quickly in this case again and again and again that is a lot more than the mind can take hence the mental breakdown near the end until he completely snaps and loses touch with reality but i assume this particular form of literary work completely lost on the guy making the list which is quite sad because they can only really be enjoyed through that lens
anime,removed,httpsstreamablecomasoo
anime,removed,seriously good question and very difficult to answer was about to say l from death note but sadly he is dead
anime,removed,this episode was infuriating here is a list of my responses to it leave the crow be and let it have its snack just leave the kitten there or better yet euthanize it there are over a thousand strays and no one sees this as a problem toss it in the ocean please dont force this on your mother when shes allergic to this already awful animal toss it in the ocean at least the show creators had the common sense to give cats butts for faces i almost couldnt finish this episode due to the overwhelming presence of this stupid kitten
anime,removed,i dont care the yuri becomes decanonized
anime,removed,nope its shiraishi the manga has already covered the summer episode so you can read ahead and spoil yourself if you like
anime,removed,nba to anime part in honor of the ongoing nba finals and this contest ive been pairing various nba franchises with the anime series they most resemble and comparing the players on those teams to the female characters in those series ive readied a new batch of comparisons but ill probably take a break from doing this after today since these take a surprising amount of effort to part one to part two los angeles clippers madoka magica let me share an epiphany i had last night former nba commissioner david stern is kyubey think about it stern arguably put revenue and ratings above all else during his term as commissioner sometimes using questionable means to do so cough frozen envelopes cough kyubey s and his kind put the creation of energy above all else sacrificing the souls of many for their goals stern renegotiated the nbas collective bargaining agreement with the players association on multiple occasions kyubey s negotiated contracts with adolescents to turn them into magical girls some of the biggest superstars who emerged during sterns reign entered the league as teenagers the magical girls of madoka magica are also teenagers the nba has gone from a league dominated by big men and interior play to one defined by offenses that spread the floor elite guards and perimeter scoring the heat death of the universe will happen because usable energy disperses outward as heat and also the universe is constantly expanding as a result of the big bang coincidence i think not so why this tangent on david stern basketball reasons basketball reasons is the now infamous explanation sterns people gave for his vetoing of a trade that would have sent point guard chris paul to the la lakers due to the veto paul ended up on las other team the clippers the clippers ascended to relevance because of the actions of stern a person of near absolute authority in madoka magica s the girls only have powers because they have been given to them by kyubey a being of mysterious power as for the actual players on the clippers there is the aforementioned allstar chris paul paul is a veteran and is regarded as one of the most intelligent people in the league many people expect him to become a coach when he retires and hes the current president of the players union the clippers also have power forward blake griffin griffin is a force around the rim but hes disliked by many of his competitors he has also gotten into trouble recently for violence off the court deandre jordan is the teams third star jordan is a durable player who this past season ended a streak of consecutive games played which at the time was the longest active streak in the nba forward paul pierce has been around the league forever and has played and beaten everyone several times over hes also seen some shit pierce once survived being stabbed times and he has possibly the most badass nickname in the nba the truth despite all of their talent the clippers have not yet made an appearance in the nba finals they probably still need another star in the mix to make a more serious run the rumor mill says that the clippers may make a play in free agency for former mvp kevin durant then again literally half the nba is rumored to be making a play for him most people agree however that whatever durants decision is fwiw i think hell stay in oklohoma city itll change the state of the nba mami tomoe is the veteran magical girl in the series she acts as a guide of sorts as she leads sayaka and madoka through their decisions regarding whether or not to become magical girls kyouko sakura is a magical girl who doesnt play well others and is much more violent than her counterparts sayaka s gains the ability to control her pain once she becomes a magical girl and it allows her to endure through fights far longer than she should homura s has seen some horrors living through her best friends death over and over and over as for madoka s she holds off on becoming a magical girl for most of the series and her decision is part of the series main plot the walpurgisnacht cant be defeated without her and she holds more potential than any other character on the show also the clippers rid themselves of an ugly menace in when they kicked out former owner donald sterling due to racist comments the girls of madoka magica regularly combat ugly menaces in the form of witches minnesota timberwolves konosuba the timberwolves ended the season a ways away from a playoff spot but few teams have a more promising future ahead of them rookie karlanthony towns burst onto the scene this past year winning rookie of the year in a landslide while solidifying himself as a franchise cornerstone for years to come the highly talented andrew wiggins is the other player vital to the timberwolves future wiggins actually started his career on the current eastern conference champs the cavaliers however he quickly got traded away to the timberwolves for kevin love a player considered to be a more polished championship piece point guard ricky rubio also has talent but hes been limited as a contributor because hes sustained multiple injuries over his years in the nba only time will tell if the timberwolves can translate their potential to future success on the court the girls from konosuba arent eligible for this years best girl tournament but the series has the potential to be a powerhouse in future iterations of the contest the biggest contender will obviously be megumin the chuunibyou wizard megumins popularity exploded during the spring anime season with seemingly half the posts on ranime being megumin fan art and cosplays the goddess aqua also has her share of fans at the very beginning of the series s aqua was forced to leave her cushy position of sending people to the afterlife and was replaced by the kinder more refined eris darkness the paladin and third female member of kazumas party would be more useful in combat if she wasnt actively seeking out pain with season on its way in the near future konosuba might be able to carry its momentum into the tournament new orleans pelicans your lie in april two seasons ago the pelicans were as a team on the rise they had made a surprise appearance in the playoffs and it seemed that if their front office added a few more quality contributors then the pelicans would be able to be a contender then disaster struck this season as they progressed through the season new orleans had to deal with injury after injury after injury only one team in the past decade has had its roster miss more games due to injury than the pelicans the team still has talent but currently a dark hue rests over the teams future new orleans unquestioned foundation for the future is center anthony davis a man of immense potential davis was a legitimate mvp candidate during the playoff season this past year at times it seemed like davis was singlehandedly trying to drag the pelicans out from the bottom of the nbas standings however davis had health issues of own and questions have been raised regarding his longterm durability the current state of the new orleans pelicans is similar to kouseis mental state at the beginning of ylia a few years before the beginning of the series s kousei was regarded as a prodigy and had promising future ahead of him as a pianist however kousei fell into the depths of trauma and depression due to his mothers illness and subsequent death in enters kaori miyazono a beautiful free spirited violist who tries to revive kousei and reawaken his love of music s unfortunately kaori has health problems of her own but she attempts to fight through them in order to create music with kousei kousei still has a lot inherent talent despite his trauma and he comes into his own as a musician over the course of the series real madrid baloncesto rwby real madrid plays the same sport basketball and are a professional team however since they play in a different league and in a different country is it really the same thing european basketball has some rules that are different than the nba which results in different playing styles and tactics regardless real madrid is a successful club winning more spanish and euroleague titles than anyone else the organization behind real madrid is probably more well known for its other team rwby is an animated series that is indeed a thing thats all for now not sure if ill continue with this but feel free to post nba to anime comparisons for the teams i havent done
anime,removed,top picks for the bracket too easy anthy himemiya revolutionary girl utena take my revoluuutiioonnnn rika furude higurashi s and umineko nipa vote for beatrice too plz hajime ichinose gatchaman crowds go bird mother on train clannad afterstory an easy shoein sengoku nadeko monogatari second season what shes in the first season too i hadnt noticed i wanna see all five of these advancing for sure or i will be ripe with anger i will boil the goddamn red sea with my anger leaving behind nothing but a massive expanse of salt

anime,removed,whats sad is the manga is now going the direction of the ending of the anime they just introduced the gundam and a big fight with esdeath is about to happen
anime,removed,s the murder mystery part was really poorly done there was literally no other person it could have been other than the teacher so about episode people started getting turned off of the show because the story of kayo and satoru was basically over besides a minute long boring wrap up in episode to show how she spent the last years so then it just kind of sputtered out
anime,removed,after a guy gets chased around by a giant breast implant if you think its not intentional youre probably in some kind of denial
anime,removed,i hated the second season for severe reasons headshot headshot the human and the princess both got their brains blown out from pretty much pointblank dont fucking tell me they survived that shit
anime,removed,there was nothing at the start to point out or even hint at the fact that there were people in space waiting to repopulate i felt like it was some m night shyamalan twist at the end of oh btw the characters you grew to enjoy really dont matter as they were there just to serve a purpose
anime,removed,agreed if they series had have concluded without the reveal of the second seventh it would have been an series that reveal in the last minutes really rubbed me the wrong way
anime,removed,samurai champloo i dont know why they decided to split apart where they got so close to each other fulfilling the needs they always wanted dont get me wrong one of my favorite animes loved everything about itbut the ending

anime,removed,he cant control it at all in the anime currently he outputs into his fingers to attack but in the manga s he can eventually start using of his power to move really quickly and run up walls and whatnot without harming himself but he still isnt very powerful so in certain situations hed still have to use all of his power its basically or
anime,removed,hehe you said boobs
anime,removed,thats good because now they can put it all into s all might smashing stuff or into momos boobs
anime,removed,inaba was the only good thing about kokoro connect but not enough to make the show good the biggest reason people like her is because of that masturbation scene shuffle was just straight up shit and so is asa mashiroiro symphony was decent

anime,removed,i think that as well she definitely shouldnt have been fucking around with a taken guy but i just cant bring myself to not like her i just wish makoto had treated her better
anime,removed,one pieces impel down was great it was relatively short and put luffy into a unique situation where he couldnt rely on s his crew like before and had to create a new s ragtag group to help him out the circumstances behind the arc and the short time frame luffy has to act on also leads to a ton of tension throughout impel down spoilers in link
anime,removed,seeing the scene that s ultimately defines the future events to come for the first time in a rewatch was really interesting that toy causes so much pain to come its so exciting
anime,removed,i mean it was kinda but it didnt give the same feeling of tension as in the book the ln was an entire chapter where they just shat all over the mc constantly until the last two or three paragraphs where stella steps in and motivates him it just went a bit too fast in the anime imo

anime,removed,slow week for me had to do a lot for school also feel free to recommend me anything httpmyanimelistnetanimelistfluffyyqt finished started watching this due to thatgif so i had no idea what i got into overall id have to say this was a nice series it had good characters and made me laugh a few times the plot felt a little bit forced a few times but nothing too bad this was also my mal entry so im getting closer to number finished i thought this was going to be an unneeded sequel but it was nearly better then the original it was a great arc to finish everything up finished fun little series i watched occasionally really comfy series to just watch a few episodes when you feel like it finished minute film from came across it by accident and decided to watch it was kinda cool to see how they showed some things back then for example when the main character notices the doorbel they actually draw a dotted line from his eyes to the bell to show that he sees it finished decided to watch something super ecchi for shits n giggles it was a lot more ecchi then i expected like a whole lot more finished ova was pretty much the same as the original finished it seems the digimon movies are of a much lower animation quality than the series even though its from looking at other series from that year it looks pretty bad also if you know a little bit about computers this show will have you think thats now how that works at least a few times im not sure how needed this is for season but i wouldnt really recommend watching this it even re uses some of the animations fromt he original which really shows how bad the animation is s also this was the first time in the entire series one digimon attacked another while it was evolving i always assumed it was instant in universe so that was interesting also there was a fun throwback to when you needed a phone for internet connection overall i have to say the music was the best part of the movie though the last few minutes had me laughing out loud s hourglass saved the day it was kinda cool that they made the enemy slow down by lagging him ill give m that finished i really enjoyed the first season so decided to give the one a go aswell seems most of what they are doing is spliting the cast in smaller groups and showing their interactions but the focus lies on one specific character and their troubles s they actually won it absolute mad women finished heard this stays true to the games and i felt like taking a trip down memory lane first of all the music was cool that was some true nostalgia they skipped over a few gyms but im aware they couldnt cover them all so far this series makes me want to watch pokemon but i doubt its as good as i rmember it being s that mega evolution of charizard was just stupid they kept mostly true to the games and then they pull a stunt like that unless you could actually let charizard evolve during the mewtwo fight in the original game and i just missed that also they fucked up with the pokemon numbering as he got more pokemon charizard evolution and mewtwo but his pokedex only went from to overall it was a good watch though watching still following the rewatch schedule so one episode a day really interesting world and characters s was cool how they did the exposition dump in ep ep was cool it what i imagine a slice of life ergo proxy would look like watching started what is supposed to be the best arc this week s i was seriously pissed when they killed those kids i hoped against hope theyd survive so many deaths i though nah they wont die but they still did im starting to understand why people say this is the best arc every episode gets better and better but holy shit i was not prepared for this s the only thing thats bugging me is how someone like killua didnt know anything about nen beforehand yet its so widly used youd think an assassin would learn it at young age watching seems like a cool show but couldnt really get into it so ill probably take my time finishing this the fanservice seems a bit forced but so far nothing really ecchi
anime,removed,other than the s twinswapping confusion i barely remember this arc i want to watch it all now but i dont want my analysis tainted by things to come other than relying on my foggy memory of when i watch this years ago
anime,removed,it wasnt just s it was an entire year
anime,removed,my prediction for why he restarted the universe is that an evil priest frames jotaros daughter jolyne for a crime that she did commit leading to jotaros attempted rescue of her however it was actually a trap set by the evil priest in order for him use his own stand to steal jotaros memories of dios research in order to evolve his own stand and acquire the perfect stand said priest will then kill jotaro and jolyne and create a new alternative universe where he himself can be god however our villain will be defeated by the unlikely hero a retard in a baseball hat

anime,removed,majikoi it was a pointless fanservice ending i mean i get what they were going for trying to avoid a waifu wars shitstorm by taking a note out of the vn but they did it in the worst possible way imo i mean the entire show was barely mediocre to begin with but that ending almost ruined the entire thing im biased though since majikoi is my favorite vn for the uninitiated s the mc in majikoi likes hermit crabs he really really likes hermit crabs and in the vn they have a joke ending where the you can avoid getting on any of the routes and instead decide to live the rest of your live devoted to your hermit crabs out of all the routes they could have chosen for the anime they decided to do the hermit crab ending all the girls are literally throwing themselves at him at the end and hes like sorry i can only get off to hermit crabs now despite almost the entire show being about these girls trying to win his affection all so no one gets butthurt that their waifu didnt win

anime,removed,episode was absolute character assassination for rem it threw everything interesting and compelling about her and threw it into the garbage compare how she acts fighting the witchs cult before and after that episode before she fought the cultists and was angry and unstable because she was fixated on revenge for s how they slaughtered her people and stole rams horn after she helped fight the white whale and got angry and shouted about how nobodys allowed to smell subaru except her and then giggled when his head fell into her boobs

anime,removed,mars of destruction
anime,removed,possible but i dont buy it i also saw a theory that s the junko that died in was actually chisa and junko was her the entire time even less likely but still crazy to think a simple smile could lead to so much speculation

anime,removed,not sure if im on my own but i cant say i like that very much king arthur was much cooler lol
anime,removed,the main points of both are main character contacting main character who died in the past in order to stop them from dying its understandable that one could be the spoiler for the other
anime,removed,if you are asking about illegal downloads then stop it its not allowed on here rule do not link tolead people towards torrents proxies or unofficial streamsdownloads other then that netflix is probably your only choice
anime,removed,the only person even suggesting that large organizations could change overnight—if only they shook off that pesky selfperpetuating logic and embraced the kyoani way of doing things—is you id love to see where i said that oh wait i didnt this is you putting words in my mouth again and if people being condescending about the way you talk hurts your feelings try actually being direct instead of insinuating vague meaning using the kind of pseudoprofound clichés youd find inside a fortune cookie oh you want direct okay then youre too stupid to get what people say therefore you invent meanings then attack based on those invented meanings you do this in order to make yourself feel smart you also like to insult people for using stock phrases yet are unable to stop yourself from repeating your own even within the same conversation like fortune cookie youre a smug asshole who belongs on riamverysmart and you should go fuck yourself with a cactus direct enough for you

anime,removed,if i recall correctly from my friends talk its some kind of love story where main yandere done something horribly bad to protag
anime,removed,you and me both it helped that i knew about the ending before i watched it tho and i knew why the author had to make that kind of copout ending before i watched it
anime,removed,just you wait lol
anime,removed,fucking weebs
anime,removed,can someone tldw this anime for me i watched it when it was airing but my kid brain just kinda didnt understand it shes a computer stuck in a kids body
anime,removed,i would say official genderbent version of saber since httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgaeaxjmrw technically came first still want a full series for it and every other fate spinoff
anime,removed,tonight on the meatbun chronicles aaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaa
anime,removed,arslan is the first son of herberderbalis the old man who was once king of lusitania and every other ruler of lusitania is fake all hail the holy king arslan im just making stuff up though its a legit theory now that i think about it
anime,removed,i ship them as well and then s etoile dies because of a stupid reason in the later volumes
anime,removed,im sorry to crush your ship but read the light novel summaries the recent volumes
anime,removed,actually the queen had a daughter and thats why they got arslan cause only males can inherit plus i personally dont think arslans origins are significant in terms of plot or character the series is about how he becomes king and him being illegit seems to be working better for him anyway
anime,removed,the wiki says that emilia is centuries old
anime,removed,i wish she would stop acting so autistic sometimes it doesnt take much to figure out that he wanted to hold hands
anime,removed,the guy on the horse actually turns out to be a pretty cool dude but it might take an episode or two for subaru to realize that im guessing hell notice the guys loyalty to his people during the coming battle where hell defend even subaru against the witches
anime,removed,amazing cuts with elsa are they bowel cuts
anime,removed,unfortunately if they follow what is actually happening in the ln which they always have they are bound to piss a lot of people off its the nature of this story and the people sticking to it have already understood whats in store for them with the last seconds of the episode
anime,removed,yes and at even after a full adaptation an anime original ending could still be added in crosses fingers
anime,removed,does holavpn suffice its relatively stable or so ive heard

anime,removed,get a paid vpn like pia for example with a vpn you can watch other countries crunchyroll catalogues because the german one is pretty limited other than that try akibapass for legal streams and downloads
anime,removed,rem really lucked out on this one unless they have to fight the whale again in the book they manage to save her but everyone forgets who she is except subaru
anime,removed,god damn it this entire sub will be on suicide watch after the emilia subaru reunion
anime,removed,andragoras is infertile not quite
anime,removed,poor rem shes nothing but plot device for shit written coma end show main heroine she dissapears for two arcs because who cares add new girl devlope her like main heroine but no raburabu for her because she is not main girl remove her from story using worst meme twist from vn genre ever main heroine appears again and her story starts here tappei is real hack
anime,removed,no i just dont give a fuck about it and i like pissing people off
anime,removed,its actually part of their ultimate but they need their brother to complete the full powered attack d
anime,removed,watch hd english sub episodes of ace attorney
anime,removed,dude spoiler tag anyway s although its presented as if hes right in a utilitarian sense i think if one considers what hes probably actually doing its still evil if you were going to save your civilization from the heat death of the universe and you found a resource that ignored thermodynamics would you put that all into maintaining the universe the way it is of course not thats an utterly absurd waste kyubeys race and whatever other races inhabit the civilization he represents will live on in space habitats floating in the void after all the stars have burned out if they have more energy than they need that means they can power more habitats it will never be notstupid to just keep the universe the way it is even if they were emotional beings who could feel attached to natural beauty of the stars and whatnot which theyre not naturally when earth no longer has a sun the current arrangement will be altered considerably for the sake of efficiency compare eating meat that you hunted in the wild only bringing down prime game vs modern industrial factoryfarming imagine the equivalent for the human species and thats how well live in the kyubeys space habitats for all eternity and it gets worse they havent discovered any races that are emotional the way humanity is the only beings that feel emotions in the universe between heat death and eternity are factoryfarmed humans living in the most horrible dystopia
anime,removed,oh fuck off you know as much as i do thats not a spoiler
anime,removed,iirc fans theorized that shokuhou misaki was the number five before it was revealed they based it on toumas thoughts in in which he considers seeking the help of the power level telepath attending tokiwadai and based on mikotos mention of misaki in remarking that s she doesnt trust that telepath theres another popular fan theory that i would love to see come true and it that aogami pierce is the number six it just makes so much sense
anime,removed,idk if this counts technically but adachi from persona technically a video game but they made a couple anime series out of it he was tired of humanity and in his experience they never treated him well so its understandable that he wanted to remake humanity
anime,removed,s sto be fair paradox knew every person who ever touched this game would die in the process and was ready to sacrifice them but not the protagonists since this would also mean their friends would die thats at least what i remember about this movie correct me if im wrong
anime,removed,rock lee and gai sensei were such bad asses holy shit this isint really a spoiler since everyone knows it will happen but i wont spoil when or how but when gai opens the gates i shed manly tears at how bad ass it was i knew it would happen one day but to finally see the last gate was too crazy
anime,removed,no it isnt a big deal it is so far of that it is quite likely that all the species active at the time die and get replaced by others that aside there never was a convincing reason why the setup in the show would be the most efficient way to harvest the energy based on the information we are given im pretty sure a more humane setup without the whole charade would be possible but even if they dont care about that then clone massive amounts of humans and putting them in virtual realities to stimulate emotions is almost surely a more efficient way for an advanced civilization the number of witches and magical girls is just far to small to represent an optimal resource usage
anime,removed,s however what makes it truly bad imo is that their race can provide the energy that humans do maybe in not that big a scale kyubey recognizes that when he said that his race views their own emotions as a disease not that they are incapable of having them
anime,removed,i doubt he met all of them so they are not really in his harem but they are more like fans of him
anime,removed,pretty much every magi villain kassim mogamett dunya judar s hakuryuu sinbad to an extent even david they all have decent reasons behind the whole manga does really well to explain that black rukh and white rukh dont necessarily mean good and evil except s arba she is just fucked in her head
anime,removed,but he doesnt know them do they still count as harem members maybe im getting this concept of harem wrong
anime,removed,httplmgtfycomqreadlightnovelsonline
anime,removed,next time put the title and tag the spoiler
anime,removed,a few girls and the death and destruction s the witches do btw since you brought up mines in africa do you think colonization was good for the colonized countries overall
anime,removed,considering hes only considered an antagonist twice against ippo and kimura id say so
anime,removed,thats what im saying humans need to stop polluting the earth and instead turn toward the unlimited vastness of space toward the future certain things to s prematurely implement this process clearly are not great and in the final movie hes clearly a villain with imo no redeeming qualities but take char in msg and zeta and origin hes clearly someone who bends the rules to uphold his ideals which are not bad and thats about it he is amuro with shades of grey
anime,removed,my point about colonization was s that a lot of what kyubei pointed out as benefits for humanity is similar to how people defended colonization you could say that because of the british and other european nations the world countries got a lot of benefits of industrialization the point is all of this is done without real consent from the other party free will is one of the biggest thing humanity values and its something the incubators and colonizers disregards also just because something isnt as bad something else doesnt mean its not bad at all
anime,removed,this and rin in bakuon
anime,removed,i thought it was just couple of sisters and not the entire network when did he get all the sisters
anime,removed,no they all in the show just want to further and cement their power they dont do this out of the kindness of there hearts so just to remind you this is your argument of course youve changed it so many times now its hard to keep track so i understand really which point of mine have you refuted s the show really goes out of its way to show lelouch is alive by showing a chin in a deleted scene when the writer of the show says that he died and the show actually saying he died what a grab for power as per your original argument but no now its that he wanted to make a legacy of being the bad guy who united the world that was united please show me where in the show there is any evidence of this also how can you say brittania didnt lose zero kills the emperor and they release all the prisoners of war and the only reason you cant see the similarities between germany and brittania is because you refuse to i did take into account youre forgetting when area was invaded the oppression and poverty of post germans is almost like the oppression and poverty of the elevens but you wouldnt know that because you know so little about the show hitlers rise and lelouchs rise are also similar they both even commit genocide they both die and the world eventually heals and becomes a better place for it one does it accidentally and the other on purpose oh but one speaks a different language and one has mechs that do their fighting so obviously they arent similar at all right germany was a counterpoint to your quip about how a country cant know peace after its dictator dies and will dissolve into civil war which you stated as a fact when its actually your unsubstantiated opinion where did i ever say lelouch was a good guy where did i ever say war was over forever please have some evidence but enough of that tangent my point is not and never was about opinions on history we are in an anime subreddit in a thread about code geass a show you say youve watched congratulations you have debunked a lot of arguments unfortunately they have all been your own seriously your comments on the show are so wrong either you cannot communicate a simple point or you have no idea what you are talking about and now youre trying to talk only about history and the human condition because somewhere inside you know you were wrong but how can i possibly take you seriously when you cant coherently argue a point about a tv show which has video evidence
anime,removed,so i made it to the s time skip in ttgl i get it now guys this shits amazing
anime,removed,i mean would you willingly subject yourself to utter suffering and s sacrifice the entire human race just so the universe lives for a few moments longer i see his point but just because hes correct doesnt mean hes right

anime,removed,is that better i feel saying the name of the show would be a huge spoiler in itself considering the title of the thread
anime,removed,that tobi was obito
anime,removed,is everyone being removed bc they named the anime seriously what anime is this
anime,removed,the removed comment are so amusing to watch even the spoiler tagged ones
anime,removed,so what was it
anime,removed,the problem isnt really that his goal is unworthy its that he achieves it through really cruel means even s madoka agrees that his goal is worthy s which is why she leaves him a path to it in her new world
anime,removed,i remember reading one theory a guy posted after episode of rezero aired he blamed subaru getting sick on the final night on him getting rabies from the dog bite in the village
anime,removed,iirc like good episodes were spent watching a highschooler stalk her teacher and hide under his crawlspace wierd is an understatement
anime,removed,yeah ive got a feeling it was said as more of a joke which blew my mind even more when the latest episode strongly suggested the dog bite may have actually been the cause
anime,removed,when tengen toppa gurren lagann burst out of the galaxy i lost my shit that was probably the most exciting moment ever seeing the shows namesake
anime,removed,you must of loved ending of then
anime,removed,the trash where it belongs
anime,removed,they sure are funny and cute i really love their dialogues when they tease the mc but nevertheless they kill him on suspicion so i will never think of them as good let alone best girls beatrice on the other hand has done more for subaru than every single girl that have debuted so far combined not trying to change your opinion just stating mine

anime,removed,even though i watched it when i was ill never forget that ending i love you
anime,removed,was the episode that badcontroversial i heard it started going downhill but to go to that scale
anime,removed,extremely heated arguments really maybe i didnt see the worst of it but even the removed comments i saw were pretty tame this is relative to what i see elsewhere on the internet and on reddit
anime,removed,certain users threw a temper tantrum because one user was not enjoying the show so far
anime,removed,i didnt realize it got locked i thought it was over last time i looked in there and it hadnt been locked at that point
anime,removed,i feel a bit bad for uamethystitalian
anime,removed,not a good thread it was honestly hilarious imo though thats mostly cause i was enjoying the heated passions driving the chaos
anime,removed,unfortunately this was released before the contest and as a result will not be counted
anime,removed,what happened in that thread
anime,removed,in case anyone is wondering nothing interesting happened anyway people who liked the show and people who didnt went at it a little bit and then the thread got locked
anime,removed,this is apedopfihle show for pedopfihles it gloiriesfies pedophilia cuz all amine is taku pander lolicon panedophile dropped

anime,removed,they either looked like or now i know they can be
anime,removed,gintama switches back and forth all the time successfully you wont see too many series that completely change genres just maybe have a different feel to them or different point of emphasis kind of how gurren lagann took on a more mature tone with more political subplots after that cast grew up usagi drop on the other hand had a less wellreceived transisition
anime,removed,trope heel turn villans character zukoerrr i mean greed or vegeta
anime,removed,it appears you arent in on the meme while i could be a knob and redirect you to routoftheloop in a manner similar to the educate yourself type responses youll see from sjws ill be explaining those in paragraph ill take the much more difficult but commendable route and explain the joke to you myself even if by the end of the process the jokes humor will be entirely lost you see people used to be much less sensitive than they are now younger less experienced and less socially apt members of society such as redditors me excluded may not have noticed that the rise of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternet has also brought about the ability for likeminded people to find each other and create online communities these communities create echo chambers with no dissenting opinions which leads to httpsenwikipediaorgwikigrouppolarization and httpsenwikipediaorgwikiextremism this effect isnt exclusive to the internet however and can occur in any environment where deviating from the norm would lead to swift punishment such as in a church this effect has led to the perpetuation of the myth of a divine creator in spite of the lack of evidence and the likelihood of such an existence being httpsenwikipediaorgwikithegoddelusion while the effect outlined above happens all over the internet even in your beloved reddit this post will be focusing on httpswwwtumblrcom httpsenwikipediaorgwikitumblr is an online community where users create blogs and can comment on and share posts from other users that they find interesting this is the birthplace of sjws sjw is an acronym standing for social justice warrior the phrase social justice warrior came into use over the last decade primarily within communities that are hostile to the idea of social justice who in applying the term warrior seek to contrast the visceral nature of activist engagements with identity politics with a presumed presence of dispassionate logic on the part of those delivering the phrase social justice warriors began a movement speaking out against the httpsenwikipediaorgwikigenderbinary which claims that there are only two genders this movement claims that gender is httpswwwgenderspectrumorg with a wide range of different genders in order to avoid offending someone by using the wrong pronoun one of the greatest offenses one can commit on tumblr people use the pronouns xexerxers which are entirely gender neutral the phrase did you just assume xer gender is a play on httpknowyourmemecommemesdidyoujustassumemygender a common punchline to jokes mocking sjws this phrase started on may after an image containing it was posted on httpimgurcom a popular image hosting website and a favorite of redditors by a user known as jcmorrowx since then it has exploded in popularity cropping up all over the internet so what do you think of my joke now that you at least slightly understand it

anime,removed,snail girl
anime,removed,kabaneri suffered from it when the show transitioned from steampunks fighting zombies with trains and shit to some overarching plot with big bad being bad oh and zombies can shoot lasers now
anime,removed,i think its because he hasnt died in the past few episodes meaning that the initial premise of the show has disappeared for a bit but yes based on this weeks episode it looks like hes probably going to reset again soon
anime,removed,this dick needs sucking get to it nerd
anime,removed,hes deliciously evil if youve got shit taste
anime,removed,madoka magika
anime,removed,shinji from fate that motherfucker
anime,removed,even the villain reveal wouldnt have been too bad if they didnt asspull this happy ending shouldve ended at episode with satoru dying i didnt dislike the guy but it wouldve a been a breath of fresh air for a villain to succeed and b also made sense from a philosophical perspective you know in the you cant save someone without sacrificing someone else way
anime,removed,kyousuke from oreimo when he crushed kuronekos heart i wanted to see him explode
anime,removed,im giving you notice of spoilers now on assassination classroom one of mine is in assassination classroom where the scientist that created koro sensei i forgot his name he started beating on his fiancé for no reason and then didnt care about when she died he then didnt care about the lives of children in the classroom and minipulated the heart of koros first pupils heart to turn him into a killing machine so yeah he made my skin crawl and im glad what happened to him

anime,removed,i dont honk rezero became a haremos or anything but just try a few episodes see if it clicks most peoples complaints come in the middle of the show when subarus mental health decays but give it a shot if the shows sounds interesting
anime,removed,hey guys its not really a recommendation but if youre looking for some good animes or a some new animes then heres a site me and my friend made where you can watch all animes in hd httpjustwatchitin if like our work please help spread the word
anime,removed,i really liked it too watched episodes the first day the next and all the rest on the i enjoyed it immensely and then the end happened i think the only reason i was so upset was because i liked it so much we basically get a things went a bit too far but we vaguely promise to do better in the future if we can this is unacceptable this society deserved to burn to the ground for what they did i actually saw it heading there after the letter maria wrote half way through but no i was so pissed especially because i liked it so much so not for me really bitter about it still apparently
anime,removed,cancer
anime,removed,in the end it doesnt even matter
anime,removed,madoka magica on episode i literally lost my head over the twist
anime,removed,heavens feel will really shine some light on kirei his intentions are a lot darker than it seems you think
anime,removed,kirei is probably the best actual villainous character of the fate series hes a wonderful meme in the fate community par for the course but the depth of his character and his badassery also contributes to his popularity i agree that anime watchers experiencing heavens feel will definitely gain new appreciation for him
anime,removed,
anime,removed,vote homuhomu for president s the evangelical church is banned im your god now

anime,removed,this comment has been removed could you add the shows title for this tag someone reported it as not having a title which means technically i have to remove it shoot me a reply when you fix it up and ill reapprove sorry for the trouble have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,removed,ok i dont really care this much unrelated and this sounds like an insult but its not meant to be do you have some form of autism
anime,removed,it is technically against the rules of the sub to share it here but various people here you can prob pm to help you get it uploaded to a place like nyaa
anime,removed,can somebody link to where i can stream this show or download the torrent
anime,removed,i mean theres practically a whole episode explaining why rem fell for subaru
anime,removed,but didnt he set her free or kill her master
anime,removed,they also mostly all get recaptured and prepared for slavery or death in a few episodes later
anime,removed,yes terus fuckup pissed me off so badly jesus fuckin christ i still get mad when i think back if it had at least been in character but terus sudden stupidity came so much out of nowhere that i just cant help but think that the only reason for these fuckups is that death notes writer didnt dare let a murderer win
anime,removed,usually i rate some anime so they wont be at the same level with alltime classics and other excellent anime other than that jojo stardust crusaders season loved the part but it was strictly about fights i love fights but an anime that exclusively focuses on one thing cant reach one punch man the exact opposite than jojo opm does almost most things right but it doesnt have a single proper fight i get that this anime isnt really about fights but considering the sheer amount of battles it should at least have one good fight paprika the movie never explains how the alter ego of that scientist paprika came to be
anime,removed,you probably just need to find some combination that forms a sentence im thinking maybe the beginning is s written vertically トキネガ タチヨル オミセハ マイアサ 解音が立ち寄るお店は毎朝
anime,removed,dazai actually has no chill im thinking that maybe ango realized the power of mimics leader gide and decided to switch sides but the soldiers that rescued him dressed differently than what we see traditionally so a third party might be involved this is getting interesting
anime,removed,death note went downhill when l was gone hunter x hunter a lot of boring episodes and i was let down by the fact that the show isnt entirely about the four main characters
anime,removed,sakuraso
anime,removed,not my favorite but i really liked whisper of the heart up to the s marriage proposal at the end its unnecessary too sudden and the studio itself said it didnt need to be there but miyazaki wanted s more resolution to the romance story at the end
anime,removed,its called a mega album for a reason lol
anime,removed,the twister scene is so good though its obviously supposed to be uncomfortable s its nadeko acting super creepy and sexually aggressive wed known forever that she had a crush on araragi but this scene is the first time she reveals how messed up her obsession with him is and it heavily foreshadows her actions in nadeko medusa i think the twister game is up there with hanekawa and senjougaharaa shower as one of the best examples of fanservice and sexuality being used for character development imo by far the worst scene in the series is koyomi and tsukihi bathing each other in tsukimonogatari that whole thing was so much more uncomfortable and more blatantly pornographic than anything else in the show and provided absolutely nothing in terms of plot or character advancement
anime,removed,test
anime,removed,please dont tell me that the pig is another kyubey who gets his power stone from magical girl brain orgasms
anime,removed,sees clannad after story has a along side monogatari having
anime,removed,death note is a because i think ls death was poorly executed it was actually very good but the postls death arc didnt live up to the hype n and the other guy thats not very memorable were poor replacements for the quirky genius that is l and i feel light lost too much of his humanity usually i can feel some empathy for villains even when they die but i felt nothing when light finally got killed he was a huge douche but thats not the reason he just wasnt relatable or realistic ever since l died
anime,removed,surprised saul bellow didnt show up on this list greatest american prose stylist of the century imo
anime,removed,just proving the trope that best girls never win but is there really a bad girl in nisekoi theyre all tops in my book
anime,removed,why do people like kaori honestly like all she did was screw with kosei the entire show and she neglected to tell him she loved him from the very beginning until she was dead like great job kiddo now youre both even more miserable then before like i get youre young youre scared you know that youre on deaths door but why does that make you write a note to the boy you love to be given to him after youre dead like she knew going into that surgery that she might not come out so why wouldnt she tell him am i missing something i really liked your lie in april but her character really annoyed me and she had a chance to redeem herself there at the end but she screwed it up not to mention that it broke my suspension of disbelief and made me realize that it seemed like really lazy tear jerk writing for the sake of making people sad because sad i would love if someone could enlighten me
anime,removed,other similarities being bland and boring side cast corruptselfish government officials stupid characters and the concept of having an entity inside of another entity ie the kabaneri inside the kabane ball or we and humans being inside of titans
anime,removed,im glad they are doing this because itll bring more money back to the anime industry because now people just use sites like kiss anime and other wants that didnt but the rights to those series im glad the industry will be thriving again
anime,removed,i really want to say yukki because despite his pussy personality being intended and a very integral part of mirai nikki i cant because that dude lost his family his friends kinda his fault but not and had to wait years before finding yuno again prepare for downvote strike from the ranime cancer cannon for even mentioning mirai nikki

anime,removed,im liking kyou a fair bit already shes a fiery one but she knows when shes in the wrong and doesnt take it out on anyone indiscriminately i approve so his family issues seem to stem from his father i assume well get details later so ill let go of it for now youre gonna have to wait a long time

anime,removed,griffith
anime,removed,on mobile and dont know code for ranime anyway whitefox so far have made a almost perfect adaption from the ln what makes you think they are going to change suddenly whitefox are infamous for never making second seasons so if they do for rezero why risk fucking it up my changing to story subaru clearly plays a huge part in the world and the author sets him up to be subaru is not meant to settle down and live a happy with anyone and will have a tragic ending with emilia so if whitefox does make a second season and change it to a subaruxrem i think it will hurt the sells of the anime bluray sales and will destroy any chance of a third season it could also have a negative impact to the sales of the lightnovel
anime,removed,if it counts the last episode of katanagatari where shichika is clearing the palace full of the swords he had bested before
anime,removed,a lot of people dropped it because the heroine s dies
anime,removed,s both sadly i even felt like accusing the author
anime,removed,amended lul
anime,removed,would you choose your best friends daughter maybe
anime,removed,well they are both years old since they have to s redo everything from the start even if they have the body of years old especially on bad ending on the vn steingate version okabe actually confessed everything to suzuha and told her he will not give up on this reality and run away from the truth even if it is not the last time he will confess again
anime,removed,the purpose of this thread is to say what anime disappointed although it looked good i did that my opinion will remain as it is and it wont change i interpret it the way i said in my initial post and it wont change and there are cash grabs that actually make sense add another season movie or whatever to a series which ended rather open would be fine adding to something that had an actual end is simply a cash grab for nothing else than that
anime,removed,sorry but where this is a baitis like go in a toradora post and say that is clear that taiga is gonna win
anime,removed,s hellsing ultimate my friends it has often been said that i like war my friends i like war no friends i love war i love holocausts i love blitzkriegs i love defensive lines i love sieges charges i love mopup operations and retreats wars across prairies in streets in trenches in grasslands in frozen tundras through deserts on the sea in the air i love every act of war that can occur upon this earth i love blasting the enemy to smithereens with artillery salvos that thunder across the lines of battle my heart leaps with joy whenever a soldier is tossed high into the air and cut to pieces by well placed sniper rounds and there is nothing like a tank operator using a tiger to destroy enemy tanks and the feeling that comes when a soldier runs screaming from his blazing tank only to be mowed down by heavy machine gun fire is such an exquisite feeling like when ranks of infantry brandish their bayonets rushing into the enemy line it moves me deep within my heart to watch a fresh recruit stabbing over and over into the bloated chest of a longdead enemy the sight of deserters being strung up from a street lamp is an irresistible pleasure and there is nothing more arousing than the sounds made by prisoners of war dropping like flies screaming in agony as theyre mowed down by ear piercing schmeissers when a band of pitiful resistance fighters makes their final stand with nothing but small arms only to have their city smashed to atoms block by block by ton bombshells tone suddenly softens im in ecstasy i love it when my forces are ravaged by a russian armored division its so sad to see towns and villages that were supposed to be defended at all costs being laid to waste their women and children being raped and killed i love to be squashed under the heel of the british and american war machines the humiliation as my men crawl around like vermin ducking the jagdbombers flying overhead gentlemen all i ask for is war a war so grand as to make hell itself tremble gentlemen i ask you as fellow brothers in arms what is it that you really want do you wish for further war as i do voice begins to raise do you wish for a merciless bloody war a war whose fury is built with iron and lightning and fire dramatically raises voice do you ask for war to sweep in like a tempest leaving not even ravens to scavenge from this earth the soldiers begin shoutingchanting krieg meaning war very well then krieg is what you shall have we are a clenched fist ready to strike down all who oppose us with our might but after enduring over half a century wallowing in the darkness for us a simple ordinary war will no longer be sufficient raises voice we need a massive war a war beyond any other that mans history has ever known we are but a single battalion the remnants of a defeated army numbering less than a thousand strong however i believe that each of you old warriors is equal to a thousand of their sickly soft children we represent a force that could easily defeat an army of a million and one men it is time for them to awake the ones who sent us screaming into oblivion and who now lie sleeping lets drag them out of bed by the hair and remind them of what we are we will remind them of what it feels like to live in fear we will remind them of the sound our jackboots make against their throats cuts to scene of alexander anderson looking up at milleniums zeppelan and the bloodred moon before fading back to the major we will remind them that there are more things between heaven and hell than are dreamt of in their philosophy cuts to soldiers shouting while looking out at scene below and then meeting of hellsing and integra before cutting back to the major our kampfgruppe of one thousand vampires is going to burn this world down to ash cuts to window scene yes my friends soon europes charred remains will illuminate the night sky cuts to window with seras and pip i have brought you all back just as i promised i would back to our favorite battlefield back to our beloved war at last the sea lion has crossed the ocean and is heading up the hill attention all soldiers of the millennium battalion this is a message from your commander friendslets bring them hell fades out to zeppelin
anime,removed,man i got so annoyed with this and the fact that mods are banning high quality content about webappsscripts cause they arent animespecific enough that i made this httpyourwaifuistrashazurewebsitesnet
anime,removed,wellits not a full romance animebut its like the time kyousuke dated kuronekothis things the most of the part is for make the main girl jeallous
anime,removed,no spoilers but i read someone in the previous episode thread say that subaru gets powers of the sins if he kills them so lets assume he eventually does wouldnt that make him satella and emilia will protect him for sure and subaru will continue to help emilia it wouldnt matter if they get together or not but emilia would be known to the public as satella when subaru is actually satella
anime,removed,yeah sorry didnt know the css code for spoiler tag and was on mobile i tagged it now i am on a computer wont happen again
anime,removed,light is absolutely unbearable freaking genius that thinks he can judge and kill the bad people to make the world better oh cmon give me a break to make maters s he doesnt even accomplish his shitty dream instead he gets caught in the most retarded manner by a character that shouldnt even exist n hes also totally unlikeable thats the point yeah not sure whats the idea there you can have characters that are pure evil and are pretty likeable eg alucard or even walter or integra and you can even have characters that are borderline retarded but also pretty good eg our beloved subaru light manages to get the worse of both worlds a true accomplishment
anime,removed,could probably get an anime time travel support group going
anime,removed,is this subbed decently can you pm me link to video
anime,removed,sokkas first girl was the princess of the northern water tribe who literally became the moon

anime,removed,jesus christ its on where you would expect it to be you dont need to be spoon fed
anime,removed,i thought rem was the pink one
anime,removed,apparently she will have a larger focus in arc where she may get character development still i prefer emilia over rem
anime,removed,mob a cute a cute
anime,removed,cant wait for the end of the season as someone whos read the light novel your all in for a major shock lmao
anime,removed,how can we quantify this by which i mean what does it mean to be a better ninja in terms of strength stamina chakra it is obviously naruto his chakra reserves combined with the fox means hes more than many times a match for kakashi but as the first hokage pointed out after being resurrected he considered itachi a better ninja than himself not because of itachis prowess on the battlefield which was formiddable but by no means the greatest but because of his willingness to make personal sacrifices for the greater good to see the larger picture even from a young age and act accrodingly and to set the pieces to protect his village even after his death kakashi and naurto are really two different heroes kakashi is much like itachi he emblematizes the hero who works in the shadows who does what he does for the greater good naruto is not very ninjalike in that way but he is still an essential hero because he inspires morale his optimism and charisma are strong factors in leading to the unity of the great nations a lot of narutos personality comes from his upbrining and his desire to be liked and that personality type can often go bad but he had great teachers among them kakashi to instill the values in him that led him to use his powers for good so who is stronger naruto who is the better ninja in conventional terms kakashi better at operating in the shadows without ego better at sticking to the mission better tactical mind smarter but the world needed a naruto he was a different sort of hero so it is hard to say

anime,removed,the body improvement club is the absolute best
anime,removed,reinhardt
anime,removed,soundofajapcatse
anime,removed,in the manga when they first meet he says that he knows the identities of every other cardinal of sin except pride so given that subaru had the witchs scent he had to be an archbishop of sin meaning he had to be pride
anime,removed,s ur mum didnt know about my masivve dik n she was a first timer too xd
anime,removed,cory in the house tbh
anime,removed,feels so good to be watching this again no one does sol like kyoani the direction is just wonderful glad to be on this ride for the third time a little bit of trivia for those that are new to the series the girls of the light music club are directly inspired by the members of the beatles yui is john lennon talented and goofy guitarist vocal could not read sheet music but is somewhat of a musical genius mio is paul mccartney left handed bassist vocal with a preference for writing corny sweet lyrics mugi is george harrison most quiet of the bunch a sensitive and super eccentric keyboard player ritsu is ringo starr spontaneous and fun loving drummer also the least musically talented of the group
anime,removed,is it cory in the house sees thumbnail fuck
anime,removed,ayyyy another heavy object fan lets go
anime,removed,they had the equivalent of muskets actually not modern guns muskets are much less effective in a chaotic closerange right than a revolver would be and yakitori is a welltrained warrior from a distinguished cavalry lineage she is pretty op in closeranged combat though s and she dies nonetheless like so many other people in the story

anime,removed,hey guys check out my video please 😊 i bet you guys will like it i stream naruto ultimate ninja storm too
anime,removed,rem best girl
anime,removed,rem best girl
anime,removed,squealer did only one thing wrong losing
anime,removed,thats obviously a joke yanno its a meme you dip i didnt think it worth replying explaining why your comment was bad till you assumed i was some otaku white knight regardless your comment was just as bad if not worse than the other guys yall take your anime way too seriously
anime,removed,what women besides rem also we all know why he is able to be in good situations he has infinite fucking redos id be president of the united states if i had infinite redos
anime,removed,actually he doesnt really have a harem atm only one girl is confirmed to have feelings for him im not a fan of subaru either but i think people prefer him to kirito because he shows a wider range of emotions and isnt ridiculously op
anime,removed,before spitting those buzzowords out of your ass at least try to understand them how is subaru a self insert his character has so many flaws and struggles and about wish fulfilling it is very far from that instead of pandering to the viewer expectation they want to ship rem x subaru the characters on the show have their own desire they are actual characters instead of mold to fit the viewers wish rezero is a cliche show that negates the cliche itself thats why it is so good so controversial and thought provoking there are actually many aspects of this prevalent through out the entire show such as the first episode where it started out as a typical isekai story then turned to something much darker cliche maids turning into murdering monsters self inserts mc to fully fleshed out non insert character another amazing thing about the show is the fact that its caressing the harem genre very gently cock teasing it but then crushing it at the same time its knocking at the harem door but suddenly being shut out that aspect of the show proves that its not your ordinary run of the mill anime but something far greater it also perfectly negates the wish fulfillment argument the way the show lead the viewers to expect a certain thing to happen but then destroying it completely is marvelous that is the exact opposite of wish fulfilling
anime,removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
anime,removed,writing an essay about kon having to ask if said person is on the spectrum
anime,removed,what character development theyve reset subara twice now after they broke him

anime,removed,ya fuk u degenrate fuck yoo go awai you r just jelos off me im fuckted ur waifu kys hashanah
anime,removed,ya rite please tell me about autism while you browse ranime
anime,removed,the difference is that the rezero ln is probably decent too compared to the garbage the sao ln is
anime,removed,first cour of sao oh look yet another person that thinks the first cour is somehow different from the other cours of sao they arent and they are all shit
anime,removed,this guy is spitting the truth these weebs are only on re zero for the reddit hype they talk like this anime is going to be remembered
anime,removed,man i wish subaru would just be my wish fulfillment op main character already and i think the side characters might have too much personality for my liking cant they just become cookie cutter harem members already

anime,removed,shiki and mikiya from kara no kyoukai shinra and celty from drrr hitagi and araragi from monogatari togame and shichika from katanagatari jacuzzi and nice from baccano
anime,removed,corey in the house
anime,removed,bring on the downvotes ranime what a valiant martyr for some cause
anime,removed,no hes not hes making decisions most people wouldnt want to make and hes acting at times like a crazy lunatic most discussion threads until last episode were subaru stop fucking up holy shit how is that selfinsert wishfulfillment unless your wishfulfillment is being constantly murdered due to fucking up and poor decision making of course
anime,removed,keeps getting rewarded with status perfect women do you even watch the series you idiot he literally has only one girl with him who doesnt think hes a fool liar or weakling well she knows it but accepts it everyone literally everyone else tossed him to the sidewalk or rejected status and its not immortality if you constantly die and feel the pain of being constantly forgotten actual consequences how about if i die nothing i did in the past few days has mattered and i just suffered for nothing
anime,removed,lol dude im joking about being trash for liking sao my entire existence is trash regardless
anime,removed,explain exactly how its mediocre dont just say something so you can be controversial
anime,removed,homura akemi and dio timestopping ensues
anime,removed,cart driver
anime,removed,if i felt like watching cringe about an autistic dipshit struggle and fail over and over i would probably stick to watamote its not a new concept its just combined with cute anime girls and a harem so it appeals to masses
anime,removed,why even bother engaging with this obvious troll he even puts a semicolon in the title
anime,removed,s a sequel about the adventures of lelouchs kid and of his annoying friends in
anime,removed,but didnt he become and thus like and became immortal thought thats why the second season is called and all
anime,removed,you are on the right point s benio does have something happen to her later that is similar to rokuros arm
anime,removed,alright looks like the guy who said that deleted his account fear not i will not allow his message to be lost to time cart driver
anime,removed,well i think this discussion needs to get reach an end at some point whats the best moment to finally open the box and determine the definiteve state of schrödingers than on the year anniversary of the franchise
anime,removed,you can have both you do a sequel but show us the world lelouch left behind after his sacrifice
anime,removed,a distant sequel would be nice to explore the aftermath of the zero requiem apart from a loose epilogue and to tie up loose ends from just because its a sequel doesnt mean it has to talk about lelouch and whether he survived or not honestly all i really want is a new anime thats unrelated to anything thats already out and at least a full cour thats related to code geass
anime,removed,i hope not lelouch being alive would be retarded he deserved what he got even if he did do good in the end
anime,removed,the harem anime would be perfectly identical to season one of cg up until the point lelouch accidentally tells euphy to kill all the japanese instead he accidentally orders her to join his harem or even better orders everyone to join his harem then it all goes downhill or uphill from there
anime,removed,what what what what is happening is it happening
anime,removed,hes alive and they make a sol about him and cc
anime,removed,all hail the return of emperor lelouch vi britannia
anime,removed,i enjoyed it although i wouldnt call it scary definitely laughed at some of the ridiculous deaths didnt see the last plot twist in the finale coming though
anime,removed,shhhhh we know you dont need to rely on shitty fanmade videos to support a theory that lelouch is the cart driver the hints are all over the place
anime,removed,i liked it was kinda creepy those first few episodes did not expect the plot twist at the end
anime,removed,jojo the great and mighty dio kneeing a dog in the face what a first impression of the eventual s universealtering dickery to come
anime,removed,long live lelouche v brittania srsly though hes alive
anime,removed,wtf i didnt cry for an anime since like when jiraiya died in naruto
anime,removed,but she kissed him at least times
anime,removed,smugpoint
anime,removed,seconding this one poor okabe goes through so much shit especially choochooru
anime,removed,theme needs updating
anime,removed,the moment in was at the part where she says i love you and we could see his tears drop on the letter
anime,removed,s spoiler goes here
anime,removed,puck is a male
anime,removed,doubt hell have to reset again iirc this is the only episode in this arc that doesnt end with him dying or being about to i have a feeling that theyre investing a lot of screentime into this reset because it is the one he survives in
anime,removed,then that should be an instant tale that subaru is not from this world and should tip beatrice off about him surprised she hasnt confronted him yet about that then
anime,removed,most of the drama stems from sickness tragedy and daddy issues theres barely any romantic drama in as

anime,removed,for me its more going to be for past month then past week since i missed all the threads and was busy kuroko no basket season i finished at the beginning of the month so i dont recall every details but the match with s murasakibara was great im just sad we didnt get to see more of s murasakibara in the zone but it was overall a really strong season and very enjoyable i gave it a solid kuroko no basket season oh boy that third season was something i was hyped up through all the matches and i loved every single bit of it even the flashback arc was great and allowed us to go deep into the goms backstory and how everyone was like and how kuroko joined the team and that final match with s akashi and his emperor eye and later in the match his first personality coming back to give his team the access to the zone vs seirins true zone overall that match was a rollercoaster and gave me goosebumps all the way to the end it made me tear up sometimes it made me laugh and it had me on the edge of my seat and it got me into basketball and i love it so much and for me this season got a well deserved even tho ill probably get some flack for that note but i dont really care since it followed my criterias kuroko no basket saikou no present desu ova this ova was pure fanservice just great overall it made me smile and i had goosebumps during the whole thing and it was a great conclusion to the season getting to watch the gom play together after the winter cup was so satisfying and that birthday party for kuroko was funny and cool thats it for this week and ill see you guys another day
anime,removed,he just said that the reason subaru can enter beatrice room so easily is because the magic of her room stops people from this world from entering her room easily however since subaru is from another world he just bypasses the magic
anime,removed,spoiler alert pastebincomgbgupskz
anime,removed,well he did revive in a parallel timeline so obviously we wont hear from him again
anime,removed,the progression in orange seemed all too sudden guy pops from nowhere and everybody instantly cares for him like if he was a lifelong friend it was too unreal most shoujos follow a general set of rules and dont tend to go too far from them but i found taiyou no ie to have a different tinge to it interactions seemed a little bit more geniune
anime,removed,i really hope there isnt
anime,removed,if next episode adapts everything youll see that theres more than just witches that visit that cafe
anime,removed,wait you translate light novels do you work with bakatsuki also thanks for the lesson ill keep it in mind
anime,removed,wait for next week lmaothings are going to get even worse
anime,removed,s she did have feelings she pushed ryuji to tell her straight that he likes taiga so that she wouldnt have second thoughts about things
anime,removed,hola
anime,removed,gonna say shigurui some scenes made me throw up s auto fellatio scene
anime,removed,euphoria was pretty icky at times
anime,removed,for regular anime id say if were including hentai then euphoria leads the pack by a significant margin
anime,removed,did you know s the directors forgot that they included the scene that they let the fans to decide why they included it in the first place they went yea sure why not
anime,removed,i agree i didnt know what to tag that thing as i didnt know whether that thing is even a spoiler or not and i agree that im writing some second hand information here im talking about the first few minutes
anime,removed,i like his way of begging its like more pronounced and beakos reaction in the manga
anime,removed,although i just skimmed through the anime to compare it with the visual novel and it looked like the visual novel had a lot more to it
anime,removed,prison school i guess i mean a guy shits himself in class a girl gets pissed on there are constant jokes about genital mutilation and the whole thing just feels kinda gross
anime,removed,as far as hentai euphoria is the most fucked up ive seen im sure there are more fucked shows out there but i try and stay away from that stuff nowadays there are also some doujins ive read that were super fuckedup one offs with pedophile rapists serial killer rapists etc for regular anime grisaia no kajitsu and its sequels get pretty fucked up pedophilia necrophilia rape gore murder incest child soldiers suicide all wrapped up in a fantastic ecchiharem
anime,removed,are you sure youre not talking about euphoria
anime,removed,i havent even seen the anime yet but apparently katanagatari has this hyped up sword fight that happe ed but it was never shown all you hear is how amazing it was after it happened so i guess that one ill be watching it soon
anime,removed,surprise yuri in this season tanakakun pretty much has a canon yuri couple and theyre adorable together and the mature way kiznaiver dealt with the theme was really unexpected and i love it
anime,removed,i disagree strongly the last episode of charlotte is by far the best seeing the mc become mad while trying to remove all the espers in the world by himself was actually pretty well done
anime,removed,i agree as well one of the best endings ive experienced but holy shit i have ptsd seriously man seeing kaoris face is just like end my life
anime,removed,probably the mysterious candy episode and then the part where arashiyama just randomly s died in an accident in the last episode i was like hououinseesit
anime,removed,the hearsay from animesuki quoting from is that gg went a bit too far there and thought that arad said yoku mite yagaru ze while japanese fans all concur that it was yoku nite yagaru ze「よく似てやがるぜ、あの人に」 which is basically he really resembles that person
anime,removed,the hearsay from animesuki quoting from is that gg went a bit too far there and thought that arad said yoku mite yagaru ze while japanese fans all concur that it was yoku nite yagaru ze「よく似てやがるぜ、あの人に」 which is basically he really resembles that person the bds having english subs should clear up a number of things
anime,removed,kirino was the best choice i just feel like it wasnt well executed the ending it was rushed and silly as a consequence of the tantrum of the writer because the publisher was being stupid and didnt allow his ending to be published
anime,removed,thats why rich people where the most one sided in their opposition to him during the campaign its all chess on their part or something
anime,removed,fatefags are the worst and i say this as a fatefag
anime,removed,death note ugh was so pissed that he went and got him self killed from gloating to soon
anime,removed,hate to piggyback on the sad news but why did the mods remove for not being animerelated but let this one about crunchyroll stay
anime,removed,how is it a legit comment that moron hasnt even watched the previous winners so how does he know theres a downturn in the writing quality
anime,removed,someone from the future just coz it seems like shirous the only one atm
anime,removed,who is your favorite ranime user evil laughter
anime,removed,loli pantsu sniffs police arrests you
anime,removed,httpiimgurcomjjvghorgif
anime,removed,cant wait to see polneraff lose to revenge plot device
anime,removed,nababri no ou had a very funny scene its a ninja series in modern japan and at some point a ninja village gets attacked by ninja mercenaries and while everyone is throwing shuriken one guy just whips a pistol and shoots people asking why the hell one wouldnt adapt to changing times though that isnt keeping the anime from giving him a best friend who runs around with a samurai sword but the scene was funny regardless
anime,removed,even now melee weapons arent entirely useless they have just more narrow place on the battlefield i want a series which gives credit wheres the credit is due also gate would be pretty fun if not paranoidal nationalism of the author and fucking loli killing delta force and spetsnaz with an axe
anime,removed,everyones talking about the heartbreaking chapter so it probably is ylia but then much worse because everything in this so far at least feels super forced and fake as fuck
anime,removed,
anime,removed,you could say that was a nice truck they played dont hurt me please
anime,removed,episode one of bakemonogatari is called hitagi crab that is the mc arararararararagi and senjougahara hitagi so technically the girl is the crab if that makes sense it has to do with her and the apparition haunting her
anime,removed,shitty skating won over mob psycho tales of zestiria didnt even get nominated what is wrong with people most fujoshi are fucking retarded i dont know how to explain exactly but you know what im talking about the craziness in on another level
anime,removed,the opening episodes of bakemonogatari deal with the girl on the left being haunted by a crab spirit
anime,removed,kys stupid attention seeing wannabe ecelb your videos and titles are garbage
anime,removed,you spend minutes saying nothing you show no proof that digis video is what caused the score to drop on mal who cares about mal scores to begin with who cares about any of this garbage anyway this video is the most trivial shit ive ever come across its clear that youre just in it for the views and easy eceleb youtube money shameless end your life jew
anime,removed,i hope youtube fails so eceleb click baiting aspies like you starve on the streets where you belong get a real job stop leeching off a retard who makes my little pony videos all day
anime,removed,lol this clickbait
anime,removed,digi didnt kill jack bub sao still exists and is popular youre exaggerating for the clicks its really hard to take you seriously your video is insincere and frankly im appalled stop kissing up to bigger youtubers you piss baby
anime,removed,i dont know of a way to comment on reddit with out an account
anime,removed,i smell bs im not buying any of what youre selling mal scores dont reflect how critically received something is youre a very narrow minded man learn to be a thinker watch more anime read philosophy understand statistics and science your video is a baseless rant aiming for great highs but all it does is fall flat i hope you feel bad about putting out such garbage i hope that dissonance you describe in your video hits you soon if not i fear for your future eceleb san if not everyone around you will stop loving you you are a shallow broken husk of a man with only money on his mind how can you expect to transcend when you make such muddy content the fact that people consider this remotely analytical speaks for the tragically broken state of the anime community this is on par with a buzzfeed article
anime,removed,yes mal is known for its hardcore userbase
anime,removed,let me give you a philosophical question my dear eceleb which came first the chicken or the egg also does a myanimelist score reflect the general consensus on a show is it some monolith to look to the answer to this is no when shows are new and airing their scores are always high when they age they lower its destiny there are many factors at play and even if i set those aside the fact that the score means nothing not everyone uses mal not everyone uses scores is also key
anime,removed,correlation causation
anime,removed,too scared to respond to my questions as expected baby eceleb
anime,removed,shes a fine lady and not a whore
anime,removed,classic eceleb we simpletons are too small for you i wish failure on to you and your channel i will downvote every video you make
anime,removed,for your information i dont think digi killed sao i dont even like sao to begin with i just think youre a flaming autist with a huge ego get over yourself and find your resting place feet under eceleb kun
anime,removed,basing this more on what i read on the animesuki post about the ln but it might be i misread
anime,removed,i said a while back that i was going to start a project about collecting notable posts and comments on ranime and i went through with it rann is a blog that attempts to collect data related to ranime on a weekly basis both to reflect and to inform about what one could have missed and to find funny and interesting posts again after a year when one sites in front of the ranime awards and doesnt remember what happened at the beginning of the year lightly nsfw i am still trying to find the correct balance i feel like emphasized the joke side this week too much while neglecting the serious discussions the exact opposite to the first article but ill figure it out a huge thanks to uhyoizaburo usheroze urinarin utaiboss and who took the time to look over my experiments and give meaningful advice that improved look and content i hope this is of use and maybe amusement of some people
anime,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvssjwnuonmgm also being x is a dick
anime,removed,what sequence of events would lead to the old jan meta thread being randomly restickied today
anime,removed,inuyasha episodes then she dies and never appears again
anime,removed,but once biba showed up everything kind of went off the rails you know what other possible aots started to blow once the main villain showed up mid season zankyou no terror at least to me
anime,removed,criticism isnt entirely subjective and there is a right way to do art or to cook while the appreciation of the end product is up to taste and the context of its production the craft behind it can absolutely be judge objectively thats why every wellrounded criticism of a storybased medium will take in account such things as narrative structure characterization camera angles and movements colourgrading photography and so on theres a method to making anything
anime,removed,the thing that bugged me was that biba could have actually been an interesting character what he was never going to be was an interesting villain and thats what the show decided to make him they already had the kabane as a villain there was no need to replace them as the main antagonist halfway through the show having him just want to kill everyone was unnecessary and it was just made worse by the fact that his justification for wanting to was cryptic at best and completely nonsensical at worst the kabane already want to kill everyone thats all they do you dont need biba there to if thats the kind of dramatic tension you want to inject into the narrative if you want the kabane to break into the city for a big climactic battle they break into cities all the time on their fucking own all we see them do is break into cities and kill people throughout the entire show biba has no purpose in the story we didnt need prettyboyred to let them in and we sure as fuck didnt need him to be there for the protagonists to be in danger biba could have been used as a great antihero he could have been portrayed as a guy that was incredibly effective at what he did at demolishing the kabane and protecting civilians but who was only able to do so because of his questionably ethics regarding his treatment of the kabaneri that should have been the conflict between him and the protagonists not the fact that he wanted to destroy the entire world for some mysterious reason but no they just made him a comically evil dipshit with little to no redeeming qualities you couldnt relate to him at all because his entire character was so contrived that he didnt even seem like a human being anymore it was one of the biggest wastes of the potential of a character ive seen in a long time they replaced a literal horde of brainless murderers with a single brainless murderer and somehow managed to give him a less intriguing personality than some of the individual zombies i bet if you gave a random zombie a sword hed have a more appealing onscreen presence in six seconds than biba did in every episode he appeared in oh wait they did that like three episodes in and it was totally badass whod have guessed

anime,removed,as much as i like rem i hope she doesnt make it that far in this contest shes definitely best girl but not best antagonist when it was only for like an episode or
anime,removed,ultimately the show suffers from extremely stupid actions oh hey train coming lets open the gate before weve confirmed theyre okay although im not sure if the city wouldve been safe even if they closed the gate in time wouldnt train come flying over the wall anyway like mentioned in the vid the fuckwits who take control of the train make so many irrational decisions hey those people who kept us alive lets throw them off the train okay but then why did you do that and then choose the most dangerous route one or the other not both you retards mumei going full retard ikoma going full retard biba going full retard mumei going full retard again overall more retard shit it really takes away from the terror of the kabane that so many of these actions are so incomprehensibly stupid i mean lets take biba his actions are irrational in the first place and they do so little to try and explain why he does it he just destroys cities for seemingly no other compelling reason than he feels like terrorizing from what i can tell because assassinating his father wouldve been way simpler than all the bullshit he pulled

anime,removed,ive all this time havent i made everything work out all right when your insignia was stolen i saved you from an insane killer at the loot house i risked my life all because you were important to me at the mansion too things worked out because of me without me it wouldve been a lot worse all of it all of it all of it all of it was because i was there you should have a greater debt to me than you could ever repay
anime,removed,you know who didnt stay alive ima just leave that sentence there evilgrin
anime,removed,i generally hate it when villains become good guys but vegeta is my lone exception simply because of how well done it is well and because he kind of sucks hard at being a good guy but well ignore that bit he transforms from a homeless bloodthirsty sociopath who literally doesnt care about anything or anyone but himself and his own status to a loving husband and father who made his home on the same planet he showed up to devastate and yet he retains all of the core characteristics intensely proud hotheaded impulsive that he had on his first appearance its incredibly hard to write a character who changes so much and yet remains recognisably the same character
anime,removed,kisschan has not forgotten about youkisschan loves you
anime,removed,they disband the group after their big performance but since love live still makes oodles of money theres a new group which is getting its own anime its called love live sunshine and theres two episodes out at the moment

anime,removed,kkkkomugi
anime,removed,username fits
anime,removed,vote hiteihime imo she wasnt an antagonist actually katangatari didnt really have any antagonist
anime,removed,komugi are you still there
anime,removed,im miffed because it characterized beatrice tanaka and the world really fast we know beatrice is super strong tanaka stands there and gets clocked its not a small hit she freaking ragdolls but then she gets back up this random weird ass girl we just met apparently has the strength to just take the full brunt of beatrices berserker install who was easily able to overpower miyu and illya with ruby and sapphire on top of tanaka and beatrice being obscenely strong illya is fairly weak at this point shes alone not knowing where she is etc it makes the whole scene feel like a godzilla movie where tanaka and beatrice are kaiju and illya is a human caught in the onslaught it also makes the line where tanaka happily says she needs to destroy the ainsworth mean something because we know she has the power to do so
anime,removed,every harem needs a yandere
anime,removed,guess what it is httpsmymixtapemoerehxnqwebm huge spoilers because if that is not it then you are objectively wrong
anime,removed,gotta wait till the ending of as
anime,removed,seriously now personalities are spoilers e are you being serious right now its not even being a serious thing either thats just saying every harem needs a yandere thas purely a post that sounds like an opinion anyone could have wrote that if thats the case you all seriously need to lighten up with what you consider spoilers thats just fucking ridiculous i support spoilers and dont think they should be censored at all but this you just gave me a fucking tumor with your nonsense i really hope i come back after clearing my melted brain from my ears to see that comment has not been deleted every shounen needs a villain every romance has a love plot one piece is about pirates those spoilers too
anime,removed,cant wait for s heavens feel to be animated
anime,removed,s hey you are taller than me

anime,removed,cory baxter hes the best anime character
anime,removed,its just sad she doesnt pull the guy
anime,removed,actually im going with idiot with gato now wait before you say anything hear me out the thing is i know that gato is a damn fine pilot and a damn fine leader of people the man has plenty of talent so why is he throwing away his talents and freethinking to a man like delaz every time gato talks about spacenoid freedom in this series i cant help but think that its just stuff that delaz put into his head for the past three years and hes just convinced himself that its true gato couldve been so much more but he sold out to a massmurderer like delaz so he can get his warriors death that goal of a warriors death is all he wants one big bang to go out on and thats what clouded gatos judgement gato willingly pissed away any chances he had to be something more in the world so that he can offer his services to a madman like delaz thats why i think gato is an idiot hes a dumb smart guy he squandered his chances to be greater just so he could die in battle thats not honorable or noble thats moronic

anime,removed,posted just now downvotes as expected
anime,removed,cant seem to claim one in time somebody pm me a guest pass pls
anime,removed,fucking oregairu ruined best girls confession to
anime,removed,i have been enlightened and thinking back although i thought it was cool at the time bc inahofanboy inaho not dying from a point blank gunshot to the head was pretty ridiculous even if it wouldnt have killed him he would have at least lost some of his memories due to the frontal lobe being destroyed this knowledge is courtesy of matpat and the game theorists videos on lobotomies resulting in the entire second season being impossible practically in short without even rewatching i now hate az woo still dying over the fact that rfuckslain is a real thing the fuck
anime,removed,dont remember exactly but i think it was the firework episode was walking yui home when her mom called right as she was about to do it
anime,removed,
anime,removed,she actually barely appears in fact some people said that it felt wrong introducing her since she did nothing not even fanservice she honestly was just there this is my pov dunno how others perceived her
anime,removed,well alluka
anime,removed,id rather listen to httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpppkcjuzdga times then listen to some autist review anime
anime,removed,consider this your warning to calm down on the fanart if you havent received one already yeah ive had my post removed and there was a whole modmail conversation about this particularly when you havent even gone through the effort of checking whether or not what youve posted has already been on the sub one time everyone makes mistakes werent you the one who banned someone for being passive aggressive we all make mistakes at least some are easy to rectify i deleted it and moved on no harm no foul reposts happen i had no idea of the fan art rule when i started posting them and i thought daily posts would be fine apparently not and have since changed my posting pattern or is my current posting amount still too much and considered spam
anime,removed,i foresee your fanart posts being underwatched from now on given that youre banned and all
anime,removed,so you no like clannad
anime,removed,so i wound up looking up more about the character and just google image searching in general for devilman comes up with some dark ass shit but then you find the ones where its the girls head just straight up on a fucking pike and it turns out her entire family gets massacred by a crazy human mob httpdevilmanwikiacomwikimikimakimura my evening is ruined
anime,removed,light novel adaptations visual novel adaptations high schools moe shit lolisunderage girls doing things any harem or pointless ecchi fanservice bullshit melodramatic bullshit destined mc incest jokes anime involving battle or war in which the girls dress like complete sluts anything involving the dere bullshit cheap victimization anything made by urobuchi trapped in a video game setting unless it isnt otaku pandering time resets that are used just to create a happy ending like clannad
anime,removed,other then being grabby and providing the tentacle fan service shots i dont remember buchans purpose most of the fan service was from his perspective so i guess you could try to shoehorn something in blue hair shooting him in the head prolly meant something but both could have easily been left on the cutting room floor giant robit episode was awesome thou
anime,removed,this makes no sense she nails her brother in the head and the cookie in his mouth flies backward over and behind his head tone caught in his sisters mouth
anime,removed,shinji came too
anime,removed,when saber disappears
anime,removed,though if you look at it from subarus perspective you would have said i love emilia too not really spoilers cuz literally everyone heard of that
anime,removed,the memories could have easily been brainwashed in

anime,removed,cuck
anime,removed,good of his own race at the expense of ours isnt that exactly what humans do though why should we be so hypocritical towards kyubey when we too use and abuse lower animals for our own needs
anime,removed,well there is the unfair hate op was talking about you refuse to see things beyond your own perspective why should kyubey even care its not like he can relate or feel bad about the girls all he sees is literally unlimited energy and you bet your ass he is going to do whatever it takes to get it just like our governments do today
anime,removed,except sayaka lol jk but really the law of cycles is still functioning madoka just isnt a part of it anymore let the gays be happy
anime,removed,
anime,removed,in one of the later parts of jojo the president of the united states is an important character and he has the power to make copies of himself the lines in the video are all his from the fighting game
anime,removed,it kind of did for me if you think about itspoilers
anime,removed,spoiler
anime,removed,mods can we please be in rall
anime,removed,its not really similar to any of his other movies if youve watched them i dont know about that the ending is almost identical to the per second except the guy actually runs after the girl
anime,removed,i dont understand why evangelion is rated so highly the whole show consist of shinji constantly whining and jizzing on girls in comas dont know how people can tolerate him
anime,removed,dude i love it and watch tons of anime its okay to admit its a little nerdy and friends who rib you arent bad friends if you had friends from when you were a kid and are now in your twenties youd understand that i fully expected that generic response though
anime,removed,i have never heard of a group of guys who were friends that didnt break balls in my life you must be part of the younger sensitive generation where everyone is a pussy and cant even take a joke without their feelings getting hurt
anime,removed,as a fyi most anime movies can be streamed for free in full dont rent
anime,removed,magic shrine maiden saliva that can turn back time
anime,removed,yes but they die again for certain secondly it lets a temporal loop occur after the killing from one hour to one day earlier because bites the dust is completely independent and autonomous kira is not informed about who gets killed nor is he aware of every time loop in fact the only person who retains memory of each time loop is the person sheltering bite the dust the time loop causes anything that happened in a previous loop to happen again even if someone tries to prevent it the next time so even if the victim doesnt interrogate hayato on this occasion bites the dust will still kill them at the time recorded before only kira can influence on the time loop by cancelling bites the dust and recalling killer queen at his side preventing any event that may have happened
anime,removed,one key limitation with killer queen is that it can only have one bomb active at a time bite the dust and sheer heart attack both count as bombs yeah i dont think theres a way for the duwang wang to counter this its all up to hayato now
anime,removed,i still cannot explain what the fuck is king crimson power
anime,removed,had to explain without spoiling the next episode or just spoiling the whole ending but by me saying this it already spoils what to expect i i think likeahardcore spoils it just enough to better understand the situation without giving away too much i think episode after this will explain it all
anime,removed,is it wrong for me to be sad that they didnt end the ep with rohan dying just to screw over the animeonly people
anime,removed,yeah they are koichi can call any of the acts at any time
anime,removed,ill give you a slight hint killer queen and btd cannot be both active at the same time
anime,removed,
anime,removed,oo free talk romance sucks ecchi is one of the worst things hentai is the worst thing ever created
anime,removed,wait isnt this supposed to be like episodes and rest of the season is just them going to nationals
anime,removed,fuck off faggot
anime,removed,that cell reference
anime,removed,you could make another short cour of a couple episodes but ending right after a training arc and before an actual tournament would be a bad move any hype would fizzle out

anime,removed,you better hope they dont before your ass ends up in kuroinu or euphoria
anime,removed,dude im upset really look at your paragraphs youre a butthurt fanboy who cant defend your own points so instead of making a valid argument you just insult me as a person because youre fucking brain dead and cant put together an argument because there is none to be made other than i like the show thats my opinion but for some fucking reason you cant take that other people have other opinions so you react like shytup you dumby havin opinions u fricken heckerhead peec of shet the point of this post was to ask people for their opinions on why they like the show not to make up stupid fantasies like you know what happened in my life you come off as a sweaty stupid butthurt weaboo i am no longer having fun screwing with you as it is starting to get boring and im going to a restaurant so i am sry if i dont reply to your next paragraph essay jesus christ tho these paragraphs
anime,removed,nice use of the call someone a child and or kid to make yourself feel superior also how is my statement considered unrational compared to yours ps phones almost or of battery at least itll give your sweat glands a break xd
anime,removed,u a dumb fuck you on mobile so i cant see ur name
anime,removed,xdxdxd
anime,removed,educate nice use of the call someone a child and or kid to make yourself feel superior using the same thing every time dude just give up
anime,removed,the evaporated sweat on your glasses doesnt inhibit ur typing just ur reading
anime,removed,again right back atcha
anime,removed,rite back atcha lol
anime,removed,nice use of the call someone a child and or kid to make yourself feel superior
anime,removed,nice use of the call someone a child and or kid to make yourself feel superior
anime,removed,so if i called u smart i guess then what your saying is right since it doesnt apply to u srsly tho calm down nice use of the call someone a child and or kid to make yourself feel superior
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i watched a few episodes and didnt really like the way the mc was portrayed his reason to become a neet seemed stupid s iirc because he was beaten up by some guys and when he was surprised that s eroges and hentai existed i kinda lost interest from what someone told me in the original cant remember if its a manga or ln the reason is diferent or at least compounded by some other stuff which makes it far more belivable but they didnt add that to the anime
anime,removed,texhnolyze i have it on my disk im a big fan of abe s despera fucking when but i know its a bit on the depressing side so ive been putting it off for a while
anime,removed,ive probably watched the ending times and i still cry every time
anime,removed,you could write a book about how changes the perception of books and shows based in their name and the place and people this titles are destined for there are dozen of examples and very little counterexamples japanese hajime no ippo the first step but also a play with ippo the main characters name english fighting spirit japanese sen to chihiro no kamikakushi sen and chihiros spiriting away english spirited away japanese boku dake ga inai machi the town where only i am missing english erased
anime,removed,first half because everything went to shit after that one guy died
anime,removed,parrot cant wait thisll be so fun seeing the parrots testimony come through lotta coming up pretty big around the end giving the second photo they certainly solved gourdy quickly here good luck to her hah maya proving once again shes best girl of course getting phoenix the time he needs to rub it in von karmas face on a side note von karmas snapping is an interesting habit of his
anime,removed,to give him due credits this dude solved a years old case within days with nothing but a single bullet and destroyed a demon with a years of winning streak his useless appearance is but a bait to lure unaware prosecutors into his web and devour them alive
anime,removed,the last fight of jojo part was pretty much impossible to win however
anime,removed,i dont think i will ever forget how dirty that went down worse is the fact that she was the cute anime girl and just got treated like that
anime,removed,ayyyy i finally saw the doctor strange movie i thought it was fantastic im not a comic book kinda guy so im confused by the postcredits scene but other than that i had a completely great time also it somewhat reminded me of disappearance of haruhi s theres just something so fucking funny about annoying the shit out of a greater entity is there any way we can sign up haruhi into the avengers team
anime,removed,mild index spoilers is a main character in raildex she speaks normally she has strong powers so the powers that be steal her dna and make an army of thousands of the clones arent perfect though and one of their quirks is that they always refer to themselves in the third person eg misaka will do that instead of i will do that among other things this helps dehumanize them cuz there are a lot of brutally murdered clones the character in this clip comes later shes a super clone of sorts one that takes longer to raise than the others which is why shes younger this is why her character doubles down on that speech pattern misaka thinks misaka will do that
anime,removed,
anime,removed,yeah he was a sadistic asshole too then he got his ass beat and then he also got shot while saving that girl so now hes crippled and then he fucking destroyed the girl that put kuroko in a wheelchair so hes kinda like vegeta used to be bad trying to be good thats as far as i understand it
anime,removed,i mean he only said he would kill him
anime,removed,my favorite thing about him is how he sees himself as the victim despite being entirely to blame for the protagonists coming after him pretty realistic for a psychopath actually he just flat out doesnt get morality though he understands what other people think is right or wrong and thus sees nothing wrong with murdering young women to satisfy his urges and in fact thinks of these urges as a sort of cross to bear because having to kill people makes it so difficult to live a quiet peaceful life
anime,removed,im aware but hes also in fategrand order as a caster and a saber already there are a bunch of servants who can be summoned into multiple classes
anime,removed,jeanne is also a servant shes in grand order and possibly somewhere else i believe shes a saber and possibly an odd class called ruler
anime,removed,it initially was the best arc by default since there was a sense of mystery behind who black is and what his relationship with zamasu is but it just drops the ball when zamasu just wants to kill mortals because theyre savage creatures or some shit and decides to just swap bodies with goku if anything its the second best arc in super
anime,removed,sure she is she felt extremely bad at having killed dragons when she learned they were humanish she gave in about helping the dragons once she saw how badly they were treated yes shes a tiny bit upset about humans in general but she doesnt go around killing human civilians when she has the chance late in the show when some humans are begging ange to save them she says no and that theyll have to fend for themselves only after they threaten her did she kill one of them ange didnt kill her sister even though she would have had plenty of reasons to do so so ange is nice to everyone close to her nice to the dragons in general murderous to those who oppose her and nothappywithbutnotkillingoutright humans id say that puts her as better than horrible for sure
anime,removed,gurren lagann shouldve ended before the timeskip kill la kill was stretched too and fatezero didnt had enough content for so many episodes
anime,removed,illyas iris is
anime,removed,kek s valentine did nothing wrong
anime,removed,obligatory griffiths hahahahahh just kidding fuck that guy
anime,removed,i mean the guy was willing to kill a few kids for manga material not to gain any power or for revenge just for some manga material the cast of jojo should be glad he isnt a power hungry guy imagine what kind of stuff hed get up to if he got a fleshbud or influenced by dio for instance
anime,removed,i found a torrent by searching the japanese title of the title its also on itunes for like yen one of my irl friends actually convinced me to try the free weekend its downloading as week speak
anime,removed,whos ready for the new rezero
anime,removed,also kills caesar though that could be argued as selfdefense
anime,removed,wrong its a well season so youre shit
anime,removed,you need to fucking chill
anime,removed,probably not a good idea being here while in a lecture ill edit this with my thoughts later when i get home
anime,removed,oh boy
anime,removed,its not so much about torrents itself they are just a way of file distribution at that point in time there were also things like ftp servers with and dc torrent just ended up being the most suitable protocol for the purpose the point is that at that point in time in that country the notion of acquiring digital goods legally was laughable prices compared to wages were absolutely unreasonable availability was terrible and relatively convenient distribution methods that we have right now didnt exist those problems still exist today but at least now legal options are on the table back then they werent hell netflix only got available in that country this year and its library there sucks ass well like in all of europe tbh new aaa games on steam cost euros when the median wage is so piracy is still a thing that almost everyone does to some degree
anime,removed,funimation has it still right
anime,removed,angel beats killed me at the end when it was implied that they met when they were reincarnated in the new episode we get to see what exactly happens and if they actually remember everything
anime,removed,this should be an alarm when a wailord is nearby in pokemon go
anime,removed,when someone asks me why i have this ringtone and they will i will tell them it is the sound you hear just before you die and no one you know will know remember or care
anime,removed,well it should stop in about episodes p
anime,removed,code geass lelouch and living on gottwalds orange farm until it all blows over
anime,removed,make sure its not a guy first like ferris
anime,removed,sweet jesus this rezero oversaturation on ranime
anime,removed,even subaru was tearing up about it in the last episode and he was the one who rejected her i think if subaru had the ability to change his emotions he would make himself fall in love with rem in a heartbeat
anime,removed,oh yeah i see that now i see coalguys seems to be very highly rated but i cannot seem to find a download of kon season on nyaa with coalguys subs do you know of any other sites that are good for downloading anime
anime,removed,rezero got very mediocre after the ep and hasnt recovered since bring on the downvotes ranime
anime,removed,reminder that subaru and emilia spent two years fucking while rem was in a coma
anime,removed,serious question are you on the spectrum
anime,removed,it is not wrong also that face makes it look like a guy he is a guy
anime,removed,i will be downvoted for this but rem and to some extend ram is a bad character thinly veiled otaku pandering flat characteristics and unconditional love subaru for no reason he saved her and her sister once and thats it in previous loops she coldly tortured and murdered him just because hes a little suspicious now shes head over heels loving him unconditionally justwhy the last episode of rezero is great but her confession is just cringy to watch if she knew his previous loops that wouldnt be so bad but she have no way to know what hed gone through it doesnt help that her fan are a little fanatical and overzealous about her being best girl and what not
anime,removed,rem is the epitome of flavor of the monthseasonal waifu the people unironically praising her will forget about her in a season or two when the next one comes along

anime,removed,dont seriously dont ask for a translation dont spoil yourself rotten apple as episode name needs to suffice enjoy episode without preview knowledge it will be so much better because episode is when the crap really hits the fan
anime,removed,yeah this is basically ntr the anime you should probably turn back now
anime,removed,did you consider what ecchan did as ntr if you did you should stop watching it if you didnt then you will be fine
anime,removed,not really spoilers i mean its not hard to imagine there is going to be ntr in an anime series about people not being able to be with the ones they love and also have to watch them be with somebody else plus the first three episodes had a bunch of ntr so why wouldnt the rest of the series
anime,removed,fuuka when she got hit by the truck

anime,removed,and moka is the only good person
anime,removed,its also scientifically proved that when it comes to sex men are much more reliant on sight and simple thoughts than women who happen to be more reliant on touch and fantaisies it was by no mean sexist
anime,removed,im a simple man really legs auto best girl status every time
anime,removed,done
anime,removed,i dont think straight women generally have dicks to fap so if youre fapping to a guy nbsp unless traps boku no pico ftw

anime,removed,had gory action later on with dark plotlines going on
anime,removed,all hail the king of britannia
anime,removed,pretty decent start characters are enjoyable looking forward to seeing them more there are two different ways i could see this going kakeru sill dies but they have less regrets or the more likely ending of changing to future and kakeru living excited for the next episode
anime,removed,years later kakeru is no longer with us okay so her future self is telling her to keep an eye on kakeru to protect him from getting killed or something man this looks like theres going to be lots of feels for future episodes
anime,removed,why is the term chinese cartooons autofiltered totally unnecessary
anime,removed,why is the term chinese cartooons autofiltered totally unnecessary
anime,removed,i just saw a little of the movie casca survives and rickert too and a black knigth wtf is going on is the movie following the manga or is the anime following the manga idontgetit
anime,removed,yeah the movies show a bit more after the eclipse and set up how he gets the arm cannon you see in the start of the one and the dragon slayer sword
anime,removed,both erased and orange seem pretty similar so far mc saving a friendloved one thanks to time travel
anime,removed,can i get the vn without a torrent
anime,removed,exactly what i thought s the illness thing seems way too similar to shitgatsu and judging by the ending i have a feeling itll end the same way
anime,removed,definitely i watched fatezero beforehand and i felt bad for her as a child then to seen her end up dealing with that fuck headsmh i wish they would of left him inside the hg so he could suffer as much as possiblebut thats just me
anime,removed,mcs are a big family
anime,removed,i think its because yotsugi has a facial expression she is a doll after all

anime,removed,s well in the manga tsukushi and jin met before school started in the restaurant owned by the girl bestfriend tsukushi was being bullied and jin helped him out in exchange he went with him to look for someone to fill the team jin ended up finding no one and tsukuchi volunteered the night of the futsal game the bullies came back and harassed tsukuchi resulting in him running to the futsal court because trains have stopped this also lead to his toenail injury its really a defining part of what tsukuchi is like and what his relationship with jin will become
anime,removed,to be fair that was only the premise of the first vrmmo in the series every other death after that was due to reallife causes not the games themselves
anime,removed,by the end only eren and mikasa will be alive lmao
anime,removed,im assuming its removed as in others cant see it didnt know animesuki is banned
anime,removed,too bad otonashi already donated his
anime,removed,let me see your smile
anime,removed,saw the wiki update it was faux check out ranimewrevisionsconfigstylesheet
anime,removed,its a bit spoilerish theres a lot to happen before it even gets to that point but i guess its there to draw interest from non manga readers
anime,removed,horriblesubs got it quick download from there
anime,removed,theres also the female titan but that was taken care of in
anime,removed,are you sure s even with the destroyed buildings on the ground
anime,removed,tbh im more interested in dezels backstory it feels like everyone elses story ended nicely in the game except dezelnot to mention the feels
anime,removed,the scene where eren pees on the armored titan is surely the best part of the manga for me
anime,removed,point me to where i can read the manga and ill disregard this im a moron when it comes for that and i havent found a torrent for all of berserk in a pdf like i have for jojos and a few other choice reads
anime,removed,yes
anime,removed,hopefully this arc will end up with subaru realizing all of that himself and growing as a person everything thats happened so far has pretty much been his fault for being so obsessed with emilia and trying to be stereotypical mckun without realizing thats not the kind of series hes in
anime,removed,well see more soon considering the shit he went through i wonder if they are going to vividly animate it
anime,removed,i really used to feel bad about subaru but since last episode he has changed so much he almost reminds me of that psychopath lover yuno from mirai nikki future diary
anime,removed,how is it a spoiler they wear the same clothes and used the same weapons you must be blind
anime,removed,yeah in ep i think u will wetness badass subaru mod ep called from zero
anime,removed,i wasnt going to watch orange bc ive already read the manga and i didnt like a few things about it and i dont want to watch something so sad and depressing but then i remembered how hard i shipped hagita glasseskun and azusa please please please have them get together in the anime
anime,removed,i wont spoil it now but theres definitely something to it
anime,removed,i think that hes obssed too much with emilia im mean i understand he loves her but still he makes her perfect when shes not sand looks like hes gonna do revival at this point because what happen to rem
anime,removed,of course he is didnt he say he was emilias knight last episode p
anime,removed,rip ram
anime,removed,actually s if that hypothetically happened the jealous witch would just take over the world and subaru would be her crippled husbando
anime,removed,luckilyunluckily the op spoiled a bit of what will happen next not how it will happen at least so thats something to look forward to
anime,removed,when does the torture porn start
anime,removed,people are just upset that its not the original experience in the game it was something like this in one cutscene you see the assassins show up and do things sometime later minutes later you meet a friendly and amiable group of characters and then not too long after that you learn that theyre one and the same

anime,removed,youre comment shouldnt exist didnt ask your opinion fuck face
anime,removed,explain how i ruined anyones night fucking stupid typical reddit user lol duck you and your upvotes i went to see the english dub and was presented with the dub because the subtitles were fuxked up lol so please explain to me how i ruined anyones night if anything you ruined mine lol eat a dick and go watch naruto lol
anime,removed,i dont torrent and use usenet for my downloads cant find your name anywhere
anime,removed,its a scene with a lot going on but that single scene explains some important things s it unveils the reason why space monsters got a huge redesign between the two series and got a lot smaller because theyre not space monsters at all it hints that the pilots are becoming like space monsters and is probably why they have some lightmagical powers later it also explains why neomonsters are always following the pilots because they give off the same reaction as the actual monsters and finally it cements the fact that diebuster does actually take place in the same universe as gunbuster also because the thing shot four giant laser beams through the second largest moon in the solar system like it was nothing and demonstrating catastrophic damage that hasnt been seen in diebuster yet and the overall reaction among the unimportant characters as they all die by the hundreds hits the point home that this is the turning point in the series just like that time noriko got in gunbuster solo
anime,removed,time travel lelouch in hiding delves deeper into the supernatural nature of the geass powers he discovers time travel which allows him a chance at fixing all his mistakes he goes back into the past and once again dons the mask of zero vowing to undo his own mistakes and make everything right this time around melodrama and chaos ensue
anime,removed,and animethehyliacom i dont download quite as much anime music as i did when i was on that kick but i remember those as my goto websites for relatively highquality ops and eds
anime,removed,the oldyear newyear new years tv show for was amazing to watch people doing various holiday seasonal events and praying live at various shrines including statues covered with nicks and scratches because of tsunami damage it is basically the opposite of the new years drop and the tsunami victims praying to damaged statues at obliterated temples was so moving yet so hopeful this coming from an atheist i enjoy watching it every year and you can see it with subtitles on nhk world its great to see all the fun and craziness like the guys running in loincloths through the snow to stories of personal loss or hope at various temples that show all the facets of human nature the personal and small examples of culture from the large and iconic festivals to personal examples of individuals are perhaps better than any work of art or fiction in illustrating our culture and humanity or you know lain sacrificing her existence to help her friend alice if it needed to be an anime thing
anime,removed,most recently kimi no na wa s when taki reaches itomori
anime,removed,i just finished death note it was amazing i definitely give it a spoilers ahead i knew it had to end the way it did however part of me really wished light succeeded are there any other shows out there where the bad guy is the main character and actually succeeds in the end
anime,removed,jojo part plot is invalidated almost the entirely when you realize dio shouldnt be that hard to kill hes still a vampire so uv light should have been how they planned to kill him from the start they couldve easily gotten those uv light guns that the nazis used in part and kicked dios ass
anime,removed,erza from fairy tail
anime,removed,in game during the fuyuki order you do come across emiya but hes just a shadow servant and kinda evil not an actual alter if he is the actual emiya alter in the anime then itd be a big difference to the game since he hasnt appeared yet in it
anime,removed,very very light spoilers maybe hes got a ton of runes that are imbued with unique spells he uses a locator one in the gameshow im pretty sure to locate rin in the einsbern castle he just loves stabbing people with his lance and always forgets or doesnt care enough about using magic inside of a battle his rune magic makes him perfect for what his master wanted him to do in the early parts of the grail war
anime,removed,was that emiya i saw in the standing next to saber hypuuuuuuuuuuuu
anime,removed,i finished this anime like a week ago i kinda livetweeted it and this was pretty much my reaction i wasnt expecting the dna stuff at first i thought that the extra power leaking outside of the barrier mutated the humans like it did with the animals it wasnt really much of a surprise it was more of a i knew it moment
anime,removed,mark t horton
anime,removed,hello im uchariotwheels little brother here it is credit card name mack scott as in the cc i hope this is enough for you to fund our magical highschool parody harem anime i hope you dont need his cc expiration date because i didnt memorize those s
anime,removed,the einzberns are special in that they actually have more control over the masters abilitys than the servant illya was designed from scratch to be a perfect master for berserker
anime,removed,eyy my boi sudo
anime,removed,no one died
anime,removed,foreign businessman contracts girls into shady and dangerous business model local girl loses here head stare
anime,removed,ayy its fixed
anime,removed,wait for heavens feel
anime,removed,speaking as someone who reads the lns theres a good chance of character development except aqua she really doesnt get development
anime,removed,yea this is basically why in deth huge and nonoverlookable plot holes an incomprehensible mc that is somehow a master of anything and everything side characters that are unoriginal and boring except klein but he doesnt do shit a whole lot of trying to be dark but just coming off as teen edginess why the fuck does every arc have a rapey bad guy there are never really any realistic dramatic stakes etc etc
anime,removed,i mean at least in bake the mc gets with one of the girls and they have an actual relationship and the mc gets laid also the romantic parts of bake i really enjoyed personally but yea i totally get the hate i really dislike evangelion and gurren lagann almost solely because of an almost knee jerk reaction i seem to have for mecha
anime,removed,ayy i get tiddies and fate on my birthday and some people call me faith get it fate faith ok i deaded it now because a teacher once mispronounced my name as it coincidences ayy
anime,removed,you are still free to pm me about these other sites
anime,removed,i dislike how lelouches father is killed lelouch just gets a second sharingan geass and orders the gods to kill him also that scene in which lelouch fakes a dialogue with his brother predicting his brothers answers and such the hard thing about making genius characters is making them extremely smart but not too smart at the same time faking a whole conversation even with someone you know very well is bullsht as a whole i liked the series but those two scenes i mentioned if i rewatched id probably find more scenes are intentional bullsht so that the plot can progress
anime,removed,you act like im not allowed to be upset at whatever the hell i want to be upset at because somehow it distracts you from your life
anime,removed,fine a bit tired and you also how can i sound anything without audible cues to listen for perhaps its your perception that is at fault
anime,removed,does anybody know when does shokugeki returns for part or season whatever they going to call it the production left us right at when the good part was starting heres a keywords hint to whats cover in next arcchapter elite ten festival more shokugeki conflict between families and much more

anime,removed,maybe hell grow up and travel back in time to help a single mom and her sick kid
anime,removed,hes not lazy hes just traditional he believes if he recruits the biggest strongest and best players and then employs a strategy of overpowering an opponent with an elite player they dont feel the need to scout other teams its the style of play in their blood as i see it

anime,removed,
anime,removed,fuck
anime,removed,literally cannot say how bad of a season fall is without getting downvoted by all the pedophiles
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i love the first game so much probably in my top games of all time i just really forgot how invested i was in the characters the trailer got me emotional and just seeing ellie that way got me a little misty eyed
anime,removed,i might be wrong but im pretty sure that is by ive got of her paintings as wallpaper
anime,removed,this is the only anime i know of where the dub aired first
anime,removed,calling kuzu no honkai really fucked up is a solid understatement but if thats your gig check out fuuka as well for some solid truckkun action
anime,removed,spoilers they probably will not get to it in season two but i realy want to see the fight between all might and all for one
anime,removed,this is probably the shinkai fanboy in me but this commercial is a lot more tasteful than the commercial for zkai featuring some autistic high school boy shouting at the top of his lungs on top of a hill and scaring away some high school girls at least niconico douga had a field day remixing that one into a bunch of dank memes
anime,removed,naruto is already dead and every time goku dies he just you know naruto goku
anime,removed,i think its a job for truckkun tbh
anime,removed,even though it isnt it looks like
anime,removed,siren sounds op you have just been visited by the midriff militia let me see what you got everything seems to be in perfect order carry on
anime,removed,obligatory yes but well done possibly one of my favourite tournament arcs i love the whole winning isnt as important as impressing the pros in the audience angle and how some of the students most notably invention girltemporarily blanking on her name adapt to that personally more curious about how far it will go before the season ends again i think the stain conflict seems like a reasonable break point
anime,removed,going if the pace of season im guessing stain will be the season finale
anime,removed,you can feel the rage
anime,removed,spoiler snow white becomes super op later
anime,removed,edgy is not a word with much meaning it can be just having character dressed in black and red or it can be a mean comment about a tragedy anyway i will take two cases from the same author takahiro majikoi kimiaru akame ga kill yuki yunawashio suminogi wakaba is a hero among others in one of his series half of the cast died and people call it edgy in another one half of the cast died and people dont call it edgy at all what makes the difference i think the clear one would be the amount and circumstances of death jumping in front of an attack to save a friend is magnitudes less edgy than having a motherdaughter raped and murdered in front of the husbandfathers grave but that aside there is also the reminiscence factor in the nonedgy series you dont have only the shock of death but also the solemnity of the moments that follow it things like funeral rites introspections nostalgia as chapters later the character still feels the tangible missing spot that the deceased person left shock factor perhaps is the keyword of this all anyway it is not like there is nothing inherently wrong with being edgy it is often seen as negative just like greasy food and soda is seen as unhealthy but people still consume it anyway because sometimes you just want that experience in particular
anime,removed,you fall in love give birth and die
anime,removed,damn and over here im dying during an eclipse
anime,removed,literal psycho belongs in the ward
anime,removed,no just no first of all theres plenty of evidence that saiyans dont need as much parental contact for their emotional well being they dont really need parents at all goku benefited from it a little but was on his own for most of his life and turned out fine that was more because of his childhood head injury than gohan sr if you actually read dragon ball the only reason vegeta even knew his father was because he was a prince and its pretty clear he didnt have much in the way of parenting from him or his mother in fact living with chichi emotionally crippled gohan when he was younger at the start of dbz he was a useless lump that was only showed his potential during periods of extreme emotional stress this was only marginally repaired after piccolo took him away from his mother for a time and trained him he was still pretty useless and whiny because of his mothers coddling in the namek story as well goku died saving him twice which you conveniently forget he also left for his sake when he died again because he realized that he was the one who was drawing all these insanely powerful beings to the planet in the first place gohan was supposed to take over as the hero of the show but fans pitched a fit and they brought goku back theres no indication he wasnt there as a father when he should have been when he was able chichi actively prevented it and pushed him away from gohan the only reason goten turned out any better is because hes friends with trunks and runs off on his own all the time that and goku trains him in secret having learned his lesson after gohan not being strong enough came back to bite everyone in the ass goku knows he doesnt need to hover around his children and hes there pretty often when hes not dead if he had his way theyd be training with him but chichi wont allow it chichi is a nag and makes him sound worse than he actually is shes a terrible mother and just not a very good person her entire family is afraid of her temper shes basically a stereotypical japanese nagging shrewish wife joke while definitely not perfect goku is a much much better parent than she is
anime,removed,one last chance state your reasons or admit that you have none
anime,removed,ahh s rapey ragyo
anime,removed,finished and promptly stared at a wall for minutes depressing doesnt begin to describe it s genocide child soldiers rape never ending war famine you name a shitty circumstance its there with no hero to fight against it no one truly wins in this anime what amazes me is that the main character is this typical shonen lead and his optimism is in complete contrast to everyone else as much as i hated him hamdo is one of the greatest villains ive ever seen and his seiyuu deserves a goddamn medal for that performance completely sold his unstable craziness also finished and it promptly became one of my favorite anime of all time the premise will make most uncomfortable but it takes its subject matter so seriously and handles it with such grace that i couldnt help but be drawn into it touching story of a love that cannot be
anime,removed,i love how dandy is completely unaware of his existence until the final episodes
anime,removed,
anime,removed,stuff like this should be posted over in the meta thread
anime,removed,so mad though honkers mackeral
anime,removed,i have been warned many times not to use the word faggot and even got banned for it once why it doesnt make sense since adding a descriptive adjective to fag to basically be a discriptor of any group has been around in internet culture for ages and it has basically lost all of its homosexual context at this point it just does not make sense to censor the word especially when its all in good fun
anime,removed,get ready for some feels later then wont say more than that
anime,removed,its a truckload of fun
anime,removed,two questions first are we ever gonna move fan contentart music cosplay to just one day of the week second has the mod team reconsidered its music video rule since the shelter incident id love to see posts and discussion on shorts and music videos because although they dont deliver plot and shit the same way were used to they usually deliver it in unique ways
anime,removed,so far this season im kind of disappointed i was hoping to have a lot of anime to watch ive already whittled it down to anime demichan and youjo senki mind you i am loving those two but i was hoping to have more to watch during the week dragon maid killed it for me in the first episode with her jealous streak ao no exorcist just doesnt look as good this time around since the mc still sounds like a blowhard braggart
anime,removed,i think you posted this in the wrong thread friend
anime,removed,a poor excuse for health care
anime,removed,why do posts about the live action attack on titan movie will get deleted

anime,removed,httpimgurcomavnvbd
anime,removed,hi heres a summary of the term ad hominem httprationalwikiorgwikiargumentumadhominem from the latin to the person is an informal logical fallacy that occurs when someone attempts to refute an argument by attacking the source making it rather than the argument itself the fallacy is a subset of the httprationalwikiorgwikigeneticfallacy as it attacks the source of the argument which is irrelevant to to the truth or falsity of the argument an ad hominem should not be confused with an insult which attacks the person but does not seek to rebut the persons argument of note if the subject of discussion is whether somebody is credible eg believe x because i am y then it is not an ad hominem to criticize their qualifications
anime,removed,holy shit autism strike inbound learn to read between the lines instead of jerking off to gunslinger girl using a fallacy isnt going to make my argument any less sound here im not appealing to an authority im saying youre expecting too much from us we arent going to understand your opinion if you just tell us to believe you and then act like youre contributing to anything because its my own opinion my point in saying monogatari was acclaimed was to make this point not because i think youre wrong monogatari is widely acclaimed for its direction and narrative format not the romance in the series which kinda falls under the narrative format part anyway saying its your opinion isnt going to make you right its only going to piss me off a little more it has nothing to do with the conversation my points your points or any semblance of a good conversation youve blown this argument way off track my point is that its dumb to think youre opinion with no back up is worth more than thousands of people who have seen the same exact thing you need to either back your opinion up or its worthless if its worthless youre wasting everyones time
anime,removed,oh man im really really looking forward for the next few episodes to be adapted hinaaaa
anime,removed,i went double autistic cos i thought it read yuru yuri camp a new camping anime sounds cool anyway tho
anime,removed,httpimgurcomatvlcjq httpimgurcomwpqnrlz httpimgurcomhwfcmmn httpimgurcomeyuoxte fucking bullies they are the worst especially if its girls
anime,removed,its a bad thing because it makes the mc completely unlikable and without a personality the only purpose of shows like this is to allow beta otakus who have never even touched a girl in their lives fantasize about just so happening to fall into a situation where there are girls allover him without even having to do anything its just unbearable to watch
anime,removed,oddly it isnt
anime,removed,i dont think it will its still early to tell if the mangaka wont go crazy on us since there are only chapters translated but so far takahashi never acts in a creepy or weird way towards the students
anime,removed,death note masive spoiler l diesmasive spoiler ends after that the show just kinda lost me
anime,removed,eh illumi is still leagues weaker than his dad and granddad who both pale in comparison to netero
anime,removed,spoilers ahead for fuuka spice and wolf kuzo no hokai magi and the labyrinth of magic guilty crown mirai nikki rezero ntr like fermi armarti from spice and wolf even though i did finish it even the innocent yuri kiss from episode of kuzu no honkai was a bit much for me because i ship the main protagonists i cant kill this super evil person because they used to be my friend halfway through magi and the labyrinth of magic and i dropped that shit on its head plot holes like big order lmfao pussy mcs that just wallow in their own self hatred and never really redeem themselves for it ex guilty crown mirai nikki and once again magi and the labyrinth of magic god i hated the mc in that show on the other hand subaru from rezero did a great job of redeeming himself so i ended up enjoying his autism dense mcs ex ichika and raku fuccbois right here diabolic lovers because why just why borderline ntr fanservice episode of akiba the animation or like every time papi went outside misunderstandings for the sake of plot development that actually slow the plot and makes the show episodic only to re use the scenes from the misunderstandings as flash backs to again stale the plot right the fuck up and when the mc sees pantsu and gets punched in the face its not really a deal breaker for me but my minimum standards for that show shoot way up
anime,removed,itt a triggered uamethystitalian
anime,removed,later chapters in the manga elaborate on the problem of succubus sexuality and really made me think about how cultures vary in their acceptance of womens sexuality satousensei must keep herself covered and avoid contact with men not simply for their sake but for her own safety and wellbeing in the manga a govt official who has worked with satou over the years states that law enforcement keeps a close watch on succubi because they are frequently the victims of sex crimes by men who use an excuse similar to she wanted it satousenseis behavior is similar to how women have to behave in cultures both modern and historic that vilify womens sexuality and place the blame for acts of sexual violence on women one way to view satousensei is to see her as a representative of populations that lack power and are often victimized with the excuse that they asked for it
anime,removed,its not anywhere actually you have to sail the high seas since its not on any legal stream that said it is exactly what you want so id say try to watch it anyway
anime,removed,maybe you might be hard pressed to find it youll likely just have to use streaming sites that im not allowed to name cause sub rules
anime,removed,hmmmm
anime,removed,
anime,removed,tldr plz
anime,removed,they actually do get together in the second season at least as far as i remember right after a ton of bullshit but still
anime,removed,oreimo was super bad i finished and eventually watch just because i like incest but i wish there where other options c
anime,removed,find ep here
anime,removed,so i watched madoka magica in one sitting and never before have i seen a more depressing show that involves cute girls everything in the show made me feel depressed the imagery was pretty depressing as everything aside from the first couple episodes was shaded in a dark tone the witches lairs a big part of the depressing imagery felt surreal in a depressing way the premise becomes more and more depressing as the story goes on the plot is depressing with the deaths of some characters and the resolution being the mc ceases to exist in our world to change the existing universe like its a good show dont get me wrong but damn it is depressing maybe im the only one
anime,removed,wow im sad xd i guess it was a good ending but i really didnt want him to die but yea the final few seconds made me feel he was still alive some how
anime,removed,he made a low effort post so i did a low effort copy and paste of animesuki subforums
anime,removed,hahaha feels bad man almost any other anime wouldve been fine even with basic reading skills i guess but not for the monogatari series dont quote me on this though ill confirm this once i get home on monday uzenoob
anime,removed,just read all of the spoilers for arc and im having a really bad about all of the next upcoming episodes
anime,removed,gluttony
anime,removed,female
anime,removed,im on like episode of rezero and read a few anime discussions on episodes prior especially episode like most peoples opinions of episode i agree that subaru was in the wrong but i also think that emilia and the people that he saved do owe him theres a multitude of faults in subaru throughout episode and he takes the lions portion of the blame he shows a great character flaw when he says that emilia owes him a debt that she can never repay its very entitled and an asshole thing to say but there is some truth to that statement she does owe him a great debt even if she doesnt know it people seem to ignore that she wouldnt be around to even be upset if it wasnt for him just wanted to get that thought out there
anime,removed,i mean the general nature of the show does not change at all aside from the story subarcs being longer than this initial episode its still the same comedy drama onizuka being onizuka all the way through
anime,removed,please please with the nigger talk
anime,removed,it is worse
anime,removed,well here you go track very episodes title card episode fight against elsa episode rem transformation episode subaru falling off whale track fighting against elsa episode or track plays too many times to count track plays during the sol parts of when subaru first meets emilia i think track plays at the appa sellers stand obviously track plays during episode or when doing chores for roswaal episode when he convinces emilia to go to the capital track most common sol theme plays in episode during the subaru chore montage episode when he meets al and other times as well track episode where subaru talks to emilia at night and other comfy moments track plays when subaru and otto ride together in episode track plays during the bluered oni story in episode and in episode and during suffering track plays during the time at cruschs mansion in episode track plays when subaru dies in episode plays a lot when he talks to beako specifically episode track standard battle theme plays during fights with elsa julius and the whale track plays when subaru dies for the first ever time along with emilia in episode track reinhards theme
anime,removed,
anime,removed,s killer queens power is the direct opposite of crazy diamonds destruction over repair might wanna spoiler this since you know major importance for the story later and all that s sheer heart attack is named after the queen album and song sheer heart attack the same album killer queen is from its real cardiac also this i dont think its name revealed yet
anime,removed,and then atom hearth father yep shit got so hype

anime,removed,killer queens power is surprisingly straightforward give it a few episodes
anime,removed,euphoria
anime,removed,mods are too busy watching anime and shitposting
anime,removed,only to get erased kira confirmed the actual erased killer
anime,removed,wont spoil it like i was spoiled on mangahere in the comments but there are some srs deaths that show how truly complex and amazing this show and series can be
anime,removed,corny i thought that but i couldnt decide if i actually really thought it or was just clutching at straws to find a reason to dislike the ending for making me sad like when she sees him on the bed and he finally finishes because she brought him home i couldnt tell if that was genuinely affecting or just sappy
anime,removed,i remember this this was part of that meme where the guy touches a snake p definitely watching this nyaasome nyaanime
anime,removed,tfw you lived long enough to see that scene and sheer heart attack animated by the way heres a short summary for the remaining episodes in part look at your own risk s episode koichi kills da ho episode jotaro repairs kiras watch episode the gang almost gets killed by a polaroid episode rohan punches a third grader episode kira gets a new haircut meanwhile the gang meets an alien episode josuke sets rohans house on fire episode josuke destroys rohans bike episode josuke goes to town on a bedridden man episode kira gets a new pet episode the gang meets local neet living in a cellphone tower episode josuke tries origami for the first time episode rohan has back problems episode kira gets his nails done and a new haircut episode kira takes his kid to school episode kira meets up with the gang episode kira shows his new love for bubble tricks episode kira talks about his attraction towards the mona lisa
anime,removed,but what about the demon chick im sure it would hurt him but the strength and conviction from her death would be great if the anime wants to move past its current placement and truly become great itd kill her off
anime,removed,lemme suckle on those toes bby
anime,removed,legally crunchyroll has a free trial and in the us you can watch episodes in low quality with ads without a subscription i believe daisuki also offers free services with ads if you create an account if you want to download stuff youll have to torrent or use less legitimate sites if you really want i can pm you more info on these
anime,removed,just stream it illegally you can find dozens of streaming sites by googling it
anime,removed,cant you tell this is the same guy who rode in and fought zodd and got by him and then took a swing at void also completely predicting and blocking his counterattack all in one of his earliest appearances there is nothing not bad ass about him
anime,removed,get a vpn i suggest expressvpn but look up best vpn germany online and youll find lists do some research or you can save yourself hassle and just subscribe to one thats highly rated on multiple sites that way youll know its good with a vpn you can do anything online and your isp will not be able to track you because your browsing becomes encrypted
anime,removed,sily could have at least pulverized that little bomb tank and maybe even grabbed the jacket im not gunna spoil but lets just say he would die
anime,removed,can anyone pm me a guest pass tried well over no computer just want to watch one piece ads keep looping please help 🙃
anime,removed,i personally didnt like how much plot armor that princess had she makes it out safely out of that last episode getting back to the train with no problems whatsoever also they really nerfed those kabane to the ground as well since samurai dude was able to take out hundreds of them without getting scratched buuuut other than the small stuff it was fun to watch and didnt take itself too seriously
anime,removed,whos that
anime,removed,where are you all watching this at horriblesubs stopped capping it
anime,removed,never really thought about how similar homura and subaru are
anime,removed,anyone knows where can i watch onepiece gold movie
anime,removed,yeah why dont you tell us how real relationships work because every single person especially teenagers fall in love for practical and qualitative reasons oh and since you mention shakespeare how does romeo fall in love with juliet oh yeah it was love at first sight but if anyone looks at someone that doesnt make you fall in love with that person i guess shakespeare is basically the author of twilight s youre a retard
anime,removed,technically yes but in this route every life on earth basically has died out the story will continue on the moon confusing but it will make sense
anime,removed,reminded me of the golden sword from campione
anime,removed,isnt that the plot of sp
anime,removed,all the ones i like and none of the ones i dont like
anime,removed,euphoria night shift nurses and bible black
anime,removed,well to not flood this thread with clannads or anohanas ive got a bit of a weird one there was a scene in bakuman that made me cry twice on both of my watches of this show this one scene made me cry it was hiramarus proposal and im honestly not sure why this specific scene hits me so hard

anime,removed,yes hopefully he doesnt die every odd minutes or so think hell start dying every minutes or so from now on out
anime,removed,one of my personal favorites httpdynastyscanscomseriestheseayouandthesun
anime,removed,ever since my entrance into the anime community in ive heard plenty of talk about an anime called gurren lagann what you havent watched gurren lagann dude you need to watch this its one of the best anime ever after years of hearing the same thing i finally decided to watch it i have no idea why people like this show its average at best very few characters are actually interesting the only characters i found vaguely interesting were viral and kaminaim on the fence with simon the rest of the cast seemed completely forgettable and bland yoko was just a pair of tits that moved on feet but the worst was by far nia teppelin she didnt feel like a human at all she felt like a characters girlfriend a i believe in you unconditionally sort of bullshit cliche character the good shounen waifu type act cute and believe in yourself half the antagonists were completely forgettable and dumb and half way through the show it went against its own strength by trying to be philosophical and smart i just couldnt get into this story since i knew that no matter what happened the main characters were always going to power through with their absolutely overpowered plot armor and the show never changed that expectation a lot of people told me that the action was where it was at but even then i dont think its that good dont get me wrong i think the fight against antispiral was pretty good too but that was like episodes out of a episode show the fight scene just arent that good especially against the scrub generals a lot of the fight scenes are just people talking through webcam in their gundam and a shit ton of still images with shaking affects im sorry to say but i think that what made gurren lagann good in hasnt aged well to the standards of since i feel like this comment is overwhelmingly negative i feel like leaving you guys off on a more positive note what i liked about the show someones death kamina was entertaining viral was by far one of the most relatable and likable character a cute teenage romance scene in the earlier episodes the last fight even if it was absurdly over the top
anime,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzbuictnalpc
anime,removed,as strange as it its i realized that jotaro is my favourite character something about his cool composure and thought process i really like he really grows on me past part s he was absent for like half of part but his minor interactions with jolyne were nice to see especially the part where he punches jolyne through a wall to break out of white snakes attack i thought to myself that it was just like him to do that
anime,removed,yeah but i also like za warudo diego if you count them as two different people
anime,removed,my favourites are konosuba and noucome im into comedies
anime,removed,i was going to say the night raid from akame ga kill but then i remembered the mortality rate is
anime,removed,amputee midget puts himself in danger to save his brothers body by searching for a red stone made out of genocide
anime,removed,is it ever going to be on crunchy you think or is there a eng dub version i can torrent i just realized i never seen this yet
anime,removed,this is it animeonlys this is when rezero shows its true face
anime,removed,oh yes this is when subaru starts to break no humor in this episode
anime,removed,i hope they do it honestly adds to his character development then that scene with emilia then oh god
anime,removed,thats totally a jojo manga in hazamadas locker thats pink dark boy an inuniverse manga it will be relevant soon
anime,removed,this submission has been removed this got a couple reports that this character was not featured in the anime if this is incorrect please let us know have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,removed,first form of echoes could only create perceptions of the sound it makes if its the next form though you may have a point
anime,removed,s op probably means to show us that the joke became a fucking reality
anime,removed,parasyte shinichi and murano
anime,removed,truckkun passing through
anime,removed,idk how to use spoilers so i am gonna try not to spoil for other people at some point i believe vol a certain character dies and this sparked a huge change in the princess following what happened she became a tyrant and wont let anyone else see solark hence the evilish look
anime,removed,got a torrent or something of these
anime,removed,only obito hadnt died thats what is coming to my head for now
anime,removed,i would keep the shinx alive i mean like fugitives coz after all tgey committed crimes
anime,removed,literally the internet jk here u go
anime,removed,you can find it on the pirate bay i would post a link but it would have been taken down
anime,removed,but the introduction of a guy that wants to be a mahou shoujo just skyrocketed this up my personal ranking check out the spinoff manga magical girl raising project it focuses on a different group of mahou shoujo so its not anime spoilery
anime,removed,the execution
anime,removed,although even in alicization theres still that make the bad dudes into sexual predators so no one has any sympathy for them thing going on at least its only with a minor villain and is only relevant for a chapter or so but still fuck that habbit
anime,removed,ive just realized that mika is just red the angry bird from the angry birds movie in human form compare the pics httpwwwangrybirdshappyplanetnetimgbirdsbirdredpng
anime,removed,angel beats now i cant even watch the op without tearing up a bit
anime,removed,code geass nunnally and her cries killed me
anime,removed,this sorry its so tiny best version i could find from katanagatari the reason it misrepresents the show is that it never happens or rather we dont see it happening that gif is the preview from the episode before that fight and thats all you get of it also this fight is probably the most fightyest fight in the show it portrays the show as an action show when it isnt truly one
anime,removed,check pms
anime,removed,the ova the goddamn ova where sotonashi has elected to stay in the afterlife on the off chance kanade gets sent back there
anime,removed,ehh thats debatable the show was never really the same without him simon isnt a badass like he was imo
anime,removed,gilgamesh vs cu chulainn sob although id rather type moon drop their milk cow and focuse on the other stuff like that tsukihime remake followed by ufotable adaptation a man can dream
anime,removed,rip caesar the music was so intense and the dialogue made me bawl
anime,removed,pmd
anime,removed,pmd
anime,removed,pming
anime,removed,incomplete adaptations are pretty much a norm in the anime industry so i cant really see why gigguk is complaining about the lack of self contained narrative for rezero i mean no one complains about how theyre still stuck on the island at the end of btooom about how the basement thing isnt even addressed by the end of the first season of shingeki no kyojin or about the fact that the gauna are still a threat by the end of the second season of sidonia no kishi instead we just hope that theyll be a season or if theres no sequel well have to read to source material to get some closure just like i did with saint seiya the lost canvas which had an excellent adaptation that only covers of the story theres also a the questions of plot holes and incomplete story lines i have to side with the source material readers on this one if i remember correctly s yamamoto gets gravely life threatening at the beginning of the shimon family arc and miraculously appears to save the day in the middle of same the arc if an theres by some chance an adaptation of this arc then yamamotos curing will be considered a glaring plot hole however we learn in the beginning of the next arc that byakuran is the one who healed him when he was summoned from the future to participate in the events of the same arc this is to say that we can discuss the plot holes of an anime only when the original material has been adapted
anime,removed,may i also receive this blessing
anime,removed,basically madoka ascended upon making her wish and became omnipresent across spacetime it has a lot of allusions to judeochristian mythology when jesus sacrificed himself on the cross what really got me was the revelation episode where they showed homuras true motives and what shes been through specifically the moment when madoka asked homura to not let kyubei trick her again couldnt contain the feels from that point on
anime,removed,he just hangs out inside his mother its not really sexual
anime,removed,okay dont watch school live for your palette cleanser
anime,removed,baka na imouto at least at the end s she came back
anime,removed,kintaro
anime,removed,straight into a train
anime,removed,ceasers death was sad
anime,removed,you are most definitely missing out if you dropped that early the greatest chunk of the series is through the first cour all the way to the end and not all of the romancedrama is centered around mashiro whos most likely autistic to some amount but all of it feels worthwhile and conclusive also a large part of her character arc is learning to take care of herself and read social cues better try not to get too hung up on her initially vacant personality because youll miss a lot of the things happening around her that are equally important in telling the story
anime,removed,
anime,removed,that adapting a story like rezero cant win when people have the anything unanswered is bad mindset either not go into the unanswered plotpoints at all which would lead to major differences between anime source or tackle them and leave them unanswered which happend here and is a way better way to approach it imo dumping all the information you shouldnt have yet whos gonna win how did he end up in the world whos the witch whats subarus role in all this whos rem would make the ending terrible i much rather have mysteries unsolved than getting it all infodumped at the last possible second
anime,removed,if you loved anime you literally have no taste try eating shit im sure youll like it this isnt meant to offend you im serious
anime,removed,hxh spoiler when meruem doesnt kill the wolf guy for saying komugi
anime,removed,i feel like im cheating because ive seen your mal a couple of times already but my guess is utaha

anime,removed,i watched martial heart for my own personal search for the worst and it was hilariously bad i laughed the hardest at the teacher telegraphing kickboxing with chemical formulas the show was hilarious from beginning to end with nothing bad happening at all s holyshit what the fuck was that ending d
anime,removed,about penguindrum s i feel like thats the right way to read the apples for the diary there is no origin story implied its entirely defined by its symbolic value think of it in part as a holy text in how its treated by those who knew momoka who is a kind of jesus figure the teddy bears are something originally soft that have been made into machines they represent how the boundaries that separate us from others harden in defense against the world that hurts us compare them to yuris fathers statues perfect things that are closed off from the world versus momokas tokyo tower which is the open accessible body without walls becoming robotic means in part cutting out emotions and softness the violence of the bomb is in part bred by how we process the violence of society in this case the cults avenging violence for the dispossessed
anime,removed,so echidnas back story before she became the witch of greed

anime,removed,japan is historically speaking an isolationist conservative countryand their population likes it that way and it works japan on the whole is a prosperous peaceful and successful society i think theyd like to keep doing what theyve been doing so far and not get caught up in a sjw agenda imo
anime,removed,we can only post legal streams on this sub but if you just google watch x show online you should be able to find some sites
anime,removed,s guess he needs to go to where the drifters are
anime,removed,whats funny is that westerners love japan because the culture is so exotic and unique this is largely due to them being isolationist and preserving their culture like it or not rampant diversity and globalism dilute and destroy culture by natural integration hence why most americans are culturally separated from their ethnic homelands

anime,removed,but buttheres that one feels scene where hes revealed to be a person from mcs dark and mysterious past and uses information never previously known to create a feels trip s yeah he gets his redemption bit but its pretty fuckin easy to do that when youre dealing with characters without a concrete background that you have to weave the character into
anime,removed,nah son kaminas the main character he does pretty much everything throughout the whole series
anime,removed,httpmwikihowcomjoinscientology
anime,removed,it happened in chapter in the manga which is very early its a spoiler sure but the story really does begin from there on
anime,removed,lol i promise it wasnt i was watching it as i typed this post😂
anime,removed,i expected jojo i just didnt expect it to have the most likes
anime,removed,animesuki lets forum members who have joined before community awards are announced that year vote for nominees then the general public is allowed to vote the only thing thats decided beforehand is the number of nominees allowed in each category i think its the most fair way to go and builds up community
anime,removed,wow youre pathetic to the surprise of litterally no one
anime,removed,notraining
anime,removed,hey all if you wanna download anime new season come to pratiwilistcom
anime,removed,the west also had shit taste and enjoys shows filled with cliché shit always does well here too the difference i think youre noticing isnt because japan has shit taste but because most people dont delve deep into most thingsthis includes anime and as such wont like a show thats not cliche the reason we seem different is because were deeply interested in it i think if you found japanese people that were actually into anime youd have at least somewhat similar opinions tldr normies are the worst and amount of sales is defined mostly by normies that want to seem like they have interests
anime,removed,charlotte yuu catches some crooks doing coke and tries it himself until whatsherface interferes
anime,removed,im a simple man i see biribiri i upvote i see ponytail pics i upvote i see biribiri ponytail pics i start foaming at the mouth and die the moe death after upvoting
anime,removed,re zero definitely had its flaws anyone who made that show who thought episodes of the main character being a catatonic muteuseless beyond words idioteye rolling moron must have been crazy when the show was good it was sooooooo good when it was bad it was some of the worst content ive ever seen yeah i got the point that they were trying to show that things are real bad but it dragged on way too often and could have been cut down to a fifth of what they showed and still made the point
anime,removed,no one says baka but i wanted to yell it at nozaki when they are watching the fireworks and he misses yet another confession
anime,removed,where people really that surprised with some of the landslide results like i feel a lot of people are just looking at the winners and didnt actually vote themselves and getting riled up for no reason like take a look at some of these nominations they are actually awful best couple satoru kayo non cannon couple bad nomination katsuhira sonozaki non cannon couple although its implied bad nomination luluco nova didnt watch but from what i hear its a non cannon couple yuri victor only canon couple so why wouldnt it win
anime,removed,if your mind was sent back in time when you were years old would you still romance your wife or not
anime,removed,we all know whats winning that let me guess queerbait on ice
anime,removed,this happened in fma but instead of a cat it was the daughters dog
anime,removed,its a romance between a year old in a year olds body with another year old their relationship is cute but its not romantic in the slightest for kiznaiver katsuhira really had emotional intelligence and the ability to even love anyone really the dude literally had to have the feelings of love explained to him in the last episode and thats the reason i said its implied because sonozaki does actually have feelings for him i said i didnt watch luluco
anime,removed,actually there is kizu subbed i watched it weeks ago maybe on gogoanime i dont remember
anime,removed,are you talking about the one on nya with the highest amount of seeds
anime,removed,the person that did the subs was just an anon in the a threads when the first bd raw came out theres no proof that he knows or doesnt know japanese also i find it hard to believe that its a made up script considering he based it on bakatsukis translation of the novel
anime,removed,cant stop kumming
anime,removed,fucking garbage i wont be able to handle all the megumin fucking shit
anime,removed,yeah it is like a divine present ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
anime,removed,stop thinking gay things about my favorite trumpet player and move on to doing gay things also stop eavesdropping and no more dealing with peoples autism thanks
anime,removed,this submission has been removed please remove the meta circlejerk and ill reapprove your post have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,removed,as far as i know there is only the ln subs out at least on nyaa what release did you watch they didnt redo all of the dialogue of course but there are still differences as with every booktvmovie adaptation
anime,removed,you forgot the part where she wants to fuck you
anime,removed,yuri on ice is probably he worst anime that i have ever been forced to watch the entirety of
anime,removed,i always found these point scales too complicated and the fact that the worst score is and not triggers my autism i dont want to spend my evenings on pondering if a certain anime deserves a or just try to distribute your anime equally over the ranking scale and youre set get one point get two points and so on and get points so just means in your case on of the best anime youve watched
anime,removed,can confirm
anime,removed,china is our last hope for ping pong boys
anime,removed,no it doesnt stulte
anime,removed,king is kind of his dad as he dies he pukes up an egg that becomes the piccolo we all know and love
anime,removed,not really no i mean piccolo is kind of a reincarnation of king piccolo namekians can get weird but that doesnt mean theyre the same character more specifically they have completely different characteristics piccolos relationship to other characters and his attitude start out very different from king piccolo and only diverges from there
anime,removed,i mean from a literary standpoint they dont overlap using many of the methods youd use to define characters you can think of piccolo as a clone of king piccolo most people would define clones as separate characters assuming the narrative doesnt use the clones to literally replace dead characters that said fma and brotherhood characters are also different from a literary standpoint some more than others an example being that i would vote for maes hughes a lot more often than i would for brotherhood so im not sure whats going on there
anime,removed,when were talking piracy at least be a decent human being and torrent the shows do not bump adinfested streaming sites view numbers

anime,removed,season of spice and wolf jk i actually just finished episode seven of s where banri and linda talk out their issues it made me very happy that the drama didnt go on for more episodes cause i was really sad for s linda

anime,removed,hibikes a tough call from what ive heard in the manga its not really a thing in the anime however they at the very least baited it hard
anime,removed,reading further into the synopsis reveals that the girl is a cupid instead of a shinigami
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i have that i dont understand why are rated so highly mobile suit gundam it takes itself way too seriously with a wonky and nonsense plot and worst of all it throws all these characters at you most are walking clichés with barely any development and expects you to care about them and cry for their struggles man what a chore it was at least it looked pretty puella magi madoka magica well the only serious problem i have with this anime is that i really dont care about any of the characters specially madoka shes indecisive and bland and they keep causing terrible situations to make you feel bad for the characters but it just comes off as who cares episode specially we barely got to know that girl the other problem i have is the character design that looks ugly as shit and those weird scenarios when the witches appear was expecting a masterpiece judging by the reviews felt it was just boring and underwhelming it could be amazing if i actually liked and cared about the girls
anime,removed,httpiimgurcomkxeuulupng
anime,removed,one of these threads eh i think that plastic memories score of and being ranked is entirely too high for a show that isnt good at all s the early episodes were all mostly seperated into three parts part a was some stupid comedy gag part b was more of the same comedy gag but done in a different way part c was where the show would try to abruptly hit you with some feels that felt so out of place that it never made sense s dont even get me started about the fuckign episode where the one robot goes rogue these mcs are working for a govt corporation and they arent allowed access to this building district of town where the rogue robot is which btw is totally barren for some reason they are worried about casualties but you dont see anyone the reason they cant access the area is because of some privatey hired security guards who have it on some stupid lockdown that apparently supersedes the power of the government body that is in charge of the robots and theyre on a lockdown because not only is the robot going rogue they are trying to keep the robot out of the hands of these thieves or gang memebrs or something so they cant retrieve information from said robot i cant remember how they get through but they do from there there is no resistance i dont remember seeing anyone there is no large gang of thieves trying to find the robot i think it was just one guy that they half assed threw in for no reason as if that plot hole isnt enough for you the fucking episode ends with a standoff on the roof of a building where the mcs find the rogue robot and out from a fucking corner comes the kid from the family who owned the fucking robot the govt is blockaded from coming into the area but some kid makes it through the blockade the suppossed gang members all the govt agents and just happens to go into the one building where the robot is and shows up on the roof at just the right time as the robot goes full rogue just so we can have a touching and riveting cliffhanger ending where the mc pulls the trigger on his robot gun to stop the robot from hurting the kid what the actual fuck
anime,removed,and i am glad to see that subaru has no lasting psychological damage either as fantards defended him for
anime,removed,rem and emilia years old i believe as for the rest i would suggest searching those terms per google
anime,removed,man your post history is hilarious to read how can someone be this obsessed with a show they hate this much do you actually have autism or
anime,removed,the real question is how much would it cost xd
anime,removed,which one rei was a total bitch and rei gives me chills rei all the way
anime,removed,mc is immortal so yanderes gonna have a field day of killing him over and over again
anime,removed,will it have bendable limbs
anime,removed,forgot about truckkun
anime,removed,i think it was a joke on how rem had her body contorted
anime,removed,who the fuck is that
anime,removed,director is actually a lesbian so she hire only females
anime,removed,how dare you make rem pout but seriously are these fixed yet this is hilarious though
anime,removed,
anime,removed,its obvious is way stronger it might be even god
anime,removed,again consider putting in tomoyas shoes he is losing ushio due the same sickness as nagisa and blames the city for it he might already want to end this already considering sooner or later he will lose her also that instead of finding shelter for himself he stayed outside and let himself die
anime,removed,comments like this make me so hyped for season when that arc gets animated holy shit this sub will explode
anime,removed,on just about every large anime community of note including increasingly here the hate emilia got when she walked away from subaru when he did his you owe me a debt you could never hope to repay the hate julius got when he put subaru in his place the hate the other royal candidates got when they also turned away subaru the sheer refusal to acknowledge everything subaru has ever done has been for his own selfish gain or to fluff his ego the unwillingness to acknowledge rem being rewritten as a perfect waifu and her subsequent insane popularity is proof of an audience who were challenged about their own worldview and sense of selfrighteousness and thus fiercely latched onto a character whose entire purpose is to reaffirm their worldview and sense of selfrighteousness and the unwillingness to acknowledge that is her sole purpose and the reason shes popular look at the comments in episode and the most recent one top comments are basically a collective nervously arrogant glee that the narrative is telling otaku they and their selfinsert dindu nuffin wrong and the world will acknowledge how much it owes them if they steadfastly refuse to ever change or acknowledge their flaws
anime,removed,also everyone in the harem is immortal due to the kissnote so she can cram as many knives as she wants into the mc and other clearly inferior love interests really its the bomb
anime,removed,the anime is sorta adapting chapters in an order for the greatest emotional impact so i was worried they might have cut some scenes i really hope we get chapter next week because it builds on how kotori feels and on tae
anime,removed,a young boy gets mad when he loses his kite
anime,removed,you should always read the terms before accepting a contract s madoka magica
anime,removed,to be fair the point of reality marble is by definition fuck your reality and your mechanics i reject it and substitute with my own so i am pretty okay with gil fight because rules are there but can be broken in very specific circumstances is pretty much standard in nasuverse gil still idiotballed though
anime,removed,no im not your friend anymore just seems childish and the characters are grown up if she even did that it wouldve been better but nooo she had to go and exploit her while pretending to be her friend utter bitch
anime,removed,mayo chiki had a twist on this kinjirou tries to save suburu and get his ass handed to him on a silver plate
anime,removed,shinji got some character development in the show you know neon genesis evangelion spoilers sure it isnt too noticeable throughout the series but i mean it happens but yeah i really dont mind emiya shirou i mean he isnt my favorite character ever but i dont hate him he wasnt the strongest sure but i mean he had heart and believed in his ideology of being a hero then again maybe thats just because i really dont like to compare ubw to zero or even fatestay night as a whole to zero there too different in my opinion for people to compare mcs like that
anime,removed,of you dont remember nagisa almost died at the same age as ushio and was only saved by her dads prayer in that forest clearing
anime,removed,well in the anime ram has a lot less screen time at this point in the show as well as the fact that rem has declared her love for the mc subaru in addition she one ups ram in the cleavage and sweetness department while i for once like rams more twisted personality and humor
anime,removed,if he likes felix so much why did he give him the fucked backstory or is he turned on by it p
anime,removed,im always for supporting the industry but if theres no way to legally watch it for you you have every right to download it or stream it i wont provide you with any direct links but httplmgtfycomqfullmetalalchemistbrotherhoodbakabt its not like i like you or anything baka

anime,removed,titan kabaneri ability coordinate
anime,removed,scene is from the latest episode of kabaneri of the iron fortress httpsgfycatcomdarkultimatedorking
anime,removed,i guess he really deserved being killed because she had sex with different women and wants to abort his child what an asshole
anime,removed,liking elfen lied is only a special opinion because most of you plebs have no taste
anime,removed,haibane renmei i really expected something mindblowing when i had to sit through episodes of slow exposition
anime,removed,fma brotherhood everything was wrapped up even though plenty of character arcs were nowhere near being finished and in many instances went against central themes of the anime the main theme is that some things are irreversible and the more you try to change something the more it ends up changing you see roy mustangs effort to change the ruthlessness of the empire but he ends up becoming a ruthless man bent on revenge also the literal manifestation of change that the elric brothers undergo the final fight scene and the ending in general goes completely against this and goes lol jk heres a happy ending dont get me started on how mustangs character obviously would never use a philosophers stone given his deep resentment of the ishbal massacre but when given the chance to repair his vision he completely goes against that conviction without batting an eye
anime,removed,yeah its a matter of personal preference i expected something that would tie everything together but s everything was hanging around without any basis to form a conclusion s were you able to understand the bird in the well sequence
anime,removed,i get this theme from every characters motivation to change or undo something irreversible and in turn becomes the very thing they sought to changeundo s scar seeks to undo the suffering his people underwent and ended up creating more suffering the elric brothers seek to bring down gods arrogance and over reach and in turn their own arrogance shines through by thinking they were superior to nature father seeks to eliminate humanity because he sees it as being too afraidsuperstitious but that assertion is based in his own fear that humanity will destroy him
anime,removed,eureka seven took an show maybe even a and turned it into a because of the last three episodes alone s wtf you became a coral reef and you couldnt even have sex with her all this shit about having sex with her and now youre deadish

anime,removed,fuck slaine
anime,removed,crispin freeman had to explain to the producers of the dub how characters swung so basically the people handling the dub knew nothing about utena
anime,removed,denpa onna did this i rated the show when up to that point i was seriously considering giving it i thought for sure they didnt intend for it to have the one possible meaning that i could say was a good decision to imply s to put it simply at the surface level the ending was completely dissatisfying i was thinking i could still give it a good score if the ending meant what i thought it did but i couldnt accept that they for sure intended it to come across that way a bit afterwards i happened to see someone else say they were very sure that it meant what i thought they didnt intend so when i thought about it a few months later after cooling my head i decided that i had to remove the rating because it wasnt fair
anime,removed,i have a one piece questiondid the straw hats crew members eventually find out about zoro taking all of luffys fatigue and painthe nothing happened incident
anime,removed,hamatora s mcs friend gets killed like episodes from the end comes back at the end of the final battle and unloads a clip into main villain pops mc in the head mc returns at the end of
anime,removed,its from episode of kabaneri of the iron fortress lol im taking the scene pretty seriously bc my opinion that its impossible ruins the scene that i want to like
anime,removed,i kinda expected the ending its common for mcs who are criminals or terrorist to s die no matter if they hurt anyone or not although i like the symbolism in the ending

anime,removed,the preview was hour later so im guessing that perhaps the episode will just air hour later on a different tv station if they were to cancel the episode they wouldnt have released a preview thats just a guess though time for the emotional lap scene in anime version bring some tissues
anime,removed,no one will be able to fight the female titan though even levi
anime,removed,i liked phantoms ending sure it ruined me emotionally but it didnt feel out of place or thrown in there for cheap emotions s if the show ended on a happy note given everything that had occurred up to that point it would have felt really jarring in hindsight i also do love tragedies
anime,removed,the mansion arc will be over in episode probably after that its a complete change of scenario new characters and a lot more exciting and sadistic stuff
anime,removed,ouma shu is now out and it focuses around inori and her internal struggle against mana and her ability to fit in guilty crown
anime,removed,steinsgate okabe doesnt exist anymore amane suzuha is the protagonist and the anime revolves around the dystopian future and world war iii or you could just watch the movie where okabe actually doesnt exist anymore and where kurisu is the protagonist trying to save him

anime,removed,i think you need to look at why they killed him each time the first death was not them the second death he appeared to be the shaman attacking the house and the third death he appeared to be a spy in the succession war the second and third death were caused by changes in the loop and while they make sense in context of his looping story outside of that they both make very valid reasons for them to attack
anime,removed,the first two part episode of the series boys its crazy how much content they have packed into these first eight episodes there is little to no down time and thats what i believe this little arc is for my three best jojo girls are as follow speedwagon jolyne kujo yukako yamagishi
anime,removed,that plankton is fine dude
anime,removed,implying yasuho isnt the ultimate waifu ftfy

anime,removed,fucking travesty who votes for that arrogant cunt over lovable aoi ranime shit taste strikes again
anime,removed,i hate the way they made every villain so terrible is sao just big stupid bags of pointless evil without a single redeeming quality to threaten the pristine morality of the hero and of course they are all rapists all bad guys are rapists the only exception was the first antagonist during the plot that had relevance
anime,removed,id agree with you but i prefer best imouto over best sensei
anime,removed,im going to post this every thread until my dreams are alive

anime,removed,flcl had high production quality
anime,removed,angel beats had a cop out ending that came out of nowhere that just played with the sentiments of the audiences to get good reception chuunibyou the romantic progression was way way too slow clannad extremely overrated it was just a tears fest with characters that were onedimensional the mc also ended up with the most boring girl shingeki no kyojin an interesting concept that was plagued by poor writing and narrative at some points it seemed like the writer was winging it on the fly sakurasou no pet na kanojo mc kept losing his temper which made him unlikeable shiinas character was incredibly bland and she came off as nothing more than a pretty autistic girl steins gate the pacing was terrible
anime,removed,just having boku no pice is bad
anime,removed,i wish it was a more generic a tiny bit of progress was made so now go buy and read the source material ending itd be nicer if machi got her mediocre honorable mention prize but through her crippling anxiety attack realized the villagers and natsu were in the audience rooting for her also if natsu showed signs of outgrowing his separation anxiety and realizing he has to let her go someday and yoshio being less of a straightup machis just the village sacrifice sociopath and instead show he does have good intentions despite his social autism
anime,removed,hachikuji
anime,removed,shokugeki no soma is basically using food porn and real porn to string along a plot that basically entails the mc never losing she loses twice but never has a repercussions because dramatic stakes were apparently never important to begin with
anime,removed,hahaha sounds dope the spoilers tough spoiler warning gantz killed their protagonist and was really populair
anime,removed,steinsgate and mirai nikki cellphones and time travel
anime,removed,i have some bad news for you
anime,removed,well you clearly dont agree with me which is cool but he does represent that statement as the truth its more than him saying that its just how he feels about it and if you want another example look at my other reply clannad right now after story is my favorite anime and the entire first season had a few really good moments but was pretty meh and some would even say bad even after storys first episodes as a season on its own are far from special
anime,removed,just letting everyone know that if you have anything that youd like to ask digi about the some of the points hes making you could always ask him on his subreddit where he answers questions
anime,removed,bitch fuck you ill track you down and bitchslap your fucking grandmother
anime,removed,ah so megumikun is the eponymous sensei looks like another show i need to watchim acquiring so many deadpan
anime,removed,hey digi mind wanna explain this video more in the commentsoh wait he cant becuase if petty mods bs
anime,removed,gay people gayyyyy jarring massively jarring but i guess people who dropped it at this episode were just not ready for watching shinsekai yori i was way more intrigued with what the fuck was happening and why rather than focusing on motherfucking gay sex people
anime,removed,lol yeaaaaaah spoilery but yes it practically hinges on you knowing the entire of negima anyway evangeline is a much better character if you knew her from negima anyway otherwise she is just kinda like a forced depth kinda character
anime,removed,well there is one he couldnt save
anime,removed,the family is certainly mafia like in several aspects but they are not a mafia they do not do crime and illegal things they are seen as a vigilante group protecting the city enforcing law and order they do however run a casino and stuff like that they do not battle other mafia families nor are they enforcers high ranking members form a pact with taroccos basically copy of tarot cards and earn a special power related to their card the story itself is about internal struggle within the family as the head of the family announces his retirement and that they will hold a contest over who will be the next family head the rest is mostly solish building up the characters and background stories of a pretty big cast of people
anime,removed,i dont exactly like watching anime movies but ive been meaning to watch madoka for a while now thanks

anime,removed,objective fact subaru x emilia x rem will be the best threesome in anime history that is actually canon polygamy ftw emiliatan pls for our hopes and dreams for all the fanart emt katoupls do it i think this could actually work subaru obviously cares for both very much and would dedicate himself to make this threeway relationship work rem is too sweet loyal and selfless to be jealous of emilia whom subaru actually loves the only problem will be emilia but she literally has no malice in her whatsoever from what we know of her so far emilia is too sweet and caring but has no sense of love she didnt know what a date is if her first experience of love is a threeway romantic relationship she might accept sharing subaru onto another topic that goddamn cellphone lol i knew subaru just used it a couple of episodes ago but i completely forgotten about it maybe his grocery bag from the first few episodes will be useful in the future too even though this episode was mostly talking much like last episode i really did enjoy watching these negotiations its a good break from the last few episodes that were so emotionallycharged crusch is such a cool character she has so much charisma she reminds me of saber but also a great mind in terms of leadership her armor and cape are awesome i like her va too shes my favorite royal candidate and one of my top favorite characters of rezero so far i heard next episode will focus on someones backstory cant wait for next week

anime,removed,i havent seen that many but im going to say rebuild of evangelion the climax of the movie really does it for me we get to see shinji about to lose someone important to him and being determined to save her the whole scene is visually artistic and abstract but it doesnt lose its intensity despite all the sacrifices that were made up until then watching it is still really satisfying

anime,removed,the whale is a creature of the jealous witch just like subaru i figured he wasnt affected because she likes him better
anime,removed,nope the whale was created by daphne the witch of gluttony as all the other mabeast but satella apparently took control over it spoiler additionally gave the power to control it to a year old kid wholl be the archbishop of gluttony and hell look pretty much the opposite of what youd expect of gluttony
anime,removed,he could just say btw the white whale is a being on equal terms with others it is called gluttony by satella there is this guy who is about to cause trouble he is called sloth
anime,removed,s did anyone else watch the whole episode wondering if the white whale just wasnt going to show up and it would turn out to be another suferu episode
anime,removed,lets just say that rem is not an option anymore
anime,removed,the whale erases with mist
anime,removed,what the fuck this is fucking awesome i wish there was more to the actual plot but who cares this is badass as hell even the girls are awesome s if only best girl didnt die like two minutes into episode oretachi wa jigoku da
anime,removed,its been inching towards it also the score is probably gonna rise when it ends a lot of people dont rare until they finish and the ending is great
anime,removed,im really glad that i went into it completely blind it definitely made the s twist at the end of the first episode all the more shocking
anime,removed,should probably nsfw tag this cause of nia im also gonna go download the movies now
anime,removed,man this whole episode i was thinking sthe whale is totally not going to show up is it glad i was wrong
anime,removed,suwa removes the let kakeru die cause suwa deserves naho page

anime,removed,people are so traumatized by it that they will talk for years and even make a day for it the damage to fans was almost as strong as for americans xd
anime,removed,what the fuck how just how
anime,removed,i dont know if she can wake up after what happened last episode
anime,removed,spoiler the original ended with a level akuma basically destroying the old hq and killing everyone
anime,removed,nobody saw usagi drops plot twist coming beware of timeskips
anime,removed,all of the above httpswwwredditcomranimewikiwatchorderwikithemelancholyofharuhisuzumiya
anime,removed,megumi is in the finals what in the actual fuck her most redeeming quality is she is nice when shes pathetic i have more salt than one of her shit dishes would have right now back when she flailed about like the idiot she was to be fair that salt was caused by a bunch of douchebags instead im sitting here wondering how the fuck you thought megumi could even match up to the levels of badassery and charm of saber or holo if this contest was purely about being a badass then we should have seen some symphogear representation based bikki and zenbu in particular but nooooooo we got ararararagimom and miyuki shiba past eliminations instead in the middle of the symphogear rewatch to boot stillmad do you know what gif i see of megumi the most on this sub its this this sums up megumi well shes pathetic confused and is more desperate than caillou when she is confronted with anything i understand this is a bit hypocritically me considering how i denounced asuna fans for invoking the yetunaired mothers rosario but i suspect megumis voter base has read the manga and are going off by her development there
anime,removed,the difference is unlike most girlnextdoor low selfesteem sweetheart characters tadokoro megumi actually shows character development s she matures throughout the series coming into her own skills and building the confidence to reliably use them while she starts out as the damsel that mc helps rescue she blossoms into an incredibly skilled chef with crazy fish butchering skills whose food evokes only the warmest most comforting feelings basically her food not only warms warms the tasters hearts but the readerswatchers too
anime,removed,so basically the entire show is just one long madoka tomoyas dreams the other world etc is actually foreshadowing to the actually super dark nature of the show the final fantasyesque imagination of tomoya in fuukos arc foreshadowing to his role in as

anime,removed,you gave code geass a you gave code geass a fucking there is only one episode in it which is actually great episode some episodes are decent but the middle part of the show china arc to lelouch taking over britannia is with a few short scenes excepted a fucking trash heap its full of random unjustified ass pulls that arent satisfying at all and all the worst fights in the series you cant even enjoy lelouch killing his father because that entire thing was just shit they made up on the spot that had no setup whatsoever i always complain about the fact that is somehow rated above on mal and i see now that you are the problem

anime,removed,s the witch of envy is a yuno gasailevel yandere and viewed rem as an obstacle to getting with subaru
anime,removed,ansatsu kyoushitsu its second season feel very different even when things are pretty much the same first season feels more like a sol and second season is more like miniarcs i enjoyed both greatly but i was more pleased with the first season should change to a instead of since it was more focused at the comedy than the second on another note i think its a great show and i dont know if everyone will agree with me but thats just my opinion
anime,removed,i am expecting some thready suggestion here well basically iam upto heavy story buildu plots with somewhat adventure into its developments here are my lists attack on titan shingeki no kyojin chuunibyou no demo goi ka shitai series erased charlotte oregairu mind if i just insert the short version title full metal alchemy brotherhood the new ones rezero re life and the list goes on

anime,removed,i havent seen dgrayman because the first season was boring for me from what i can tell the animation is much better its not stupidly darklightly lit in every scene from the op intro the odd looking kingpinclown akuma is still there as maybe the final boss ew the episode plays out like the first level of a game new headquarters allens powers are sealed and the cia has become paranoid i think its a good episode probably great if i saw dgray man
anime,removed,s reinhart is literally jesus
anime,removed,well considering funny valentine jojos bizarre adventure part is the president i think we have an answer
anime,removed,late response here but i do still enjoy anime discussion threads are hard for me because ive never been into airing anime this weekend i finished up rewatching paranoia agent and rewatched paprika ive been on a bit of a satoshi kon kick recently
anime,removed,late but ill give my two cents on the six anime i gave a durarara s when everyone in the crowd is revealed to be part of the dollars and the ensuing chaos i particularly liked how the generally greyed out background characters all gained colour upon the reveal fma brotherhood roy mustang vs lust hunter x hunter when gon s punched hisoka noragami aragoto s ebisus death psychopass s when makishima kills akanes friend steinsgate the end of episode

anime,removed,completed haikyuu so with the third season coming up and the fact that this has been on my on hold list since i decided to pick up the show again i think i had it on hold after four episodes because i was watching too much anime at once at the time and eventually just forgot about it boy let me tell you i have been missing out its funny that this show made me fall madly in love with volleyball considering the fact i hated volleyball when i was a little girl that might have just been because i was stubborn and it was one of the only sports i couldnt get the hang of though i especially like how the show has the characters playing volleyball volleyball instead of power rangers volleyball a la kuroko no basket it was also nice to see none of the teams are like villains and that there are even friends that are one different teams despite competing against eachother like kenma and hinata was a solid for me im sort of sad i binged both seasons though because now i have to wait a month for more watching natsume yuujincho san much like haikyuu i picked up the series after seeing it was getting a sequel which finally forced me to take the series off of my plan to watch list i have no idea why i once again didnt do this sooner waityesidoitsbecauseiwatchtoomuchanime some of the yokai dont have super intricate stories but ill be damned because almost all of their stories have made me feel some sort of sadnesshappiness the only complaint i have about the show and its mostly a nitpick but it still bothers me none the less s natoris fucking birthmark curse thing sickens me so much like everytime it moves i feel so itchy it drives me insane just thinking about it makes me feel gross then the creators decided lets also have a gross sound effect to accompany it whenever it moves across his face a shit like noooooooo whyyyyyyy i have to cover his face whenever hes on screen and take off my headphones because i just cant take it i makes my skin crawl

anime,removed,i gave it a reasons art ill admit im not very critical of art so i probably wouldnt notice some of the problems other might the art style though amazing in my opinion everything from how the characters look to the labyrinths and witches the school setting homuras space pretty much all of it sound i still regularly listen to the op ed and miki sayakas theme i listen to the other characters themes as well with less frequency i loved the sound spoilers plottonethemes utilitarianism with some contractarianism thrown in vs categorical morals be careful what you wish for heros journey maybe a little bit of underdog story as well combining science and fantasy in an interesting way the plot device introduced in episode individually i guess theres nothing crazy new here but that means basically nothing to me what matters to me is how well they do it i think the series uses these elements and blends them in very cool ways that i wasnt expecting the conclusion is one of my favorite anime endings alongside your lie in april and fullmetal alchemist brotherhood the way thw tone darkens as the series progresses and the way everything is pieced together near end is brilliant it also great for rewatching and seeing all the characters in a new light characters homura is best girl i really liked all the characters i felt all them of had clear motivations and acted in ways that would be sensible for kids to act in their circumstances nobody felt bland or one dimensional except maybe the main character at times they are very memorable and their interactions make sense moreso on a rewatch because spoilers theyre not annoyingly good or laughably evil they just feel like normal people which i appreciate
anime,removed,everyone pissed about how awful the characters and overall plot of sao ended up got the anime that does a kinda similar thing with enjoyable characters and an actually kinda okay plot plus bells got some of the cutest and more endearing harem members in an action show that ive seen in a long time lili had a unique backstory hestia is hestia the guild clerk seems genuine the waitress is kind and the second coming of autismchan feels like she isnt just gunning for bells cock and actually helps him and her spin off should be really fun and good they all felt like characters who have things to do other than chase after bell
anime,removed,in all fairness thats kind of the point shes meant to feel out of place because she is out of place its also a question of is she trying to distract you from elements around her or distract you from herself
anime,removed,unnecessary they have a reason to exist though theyre supposed to distract you and paint her as token fanservice character when in fact she is one of the driving forces of the plot the actual plot not plot

anime,removed,never saw the japanese version but from the comments it seems that they cut alot of content leaving the viewers unanswered but from the chinese version pretty much everything is pretty straight forward he was basically a coma and in critical state from overworking and everything that happened in his dream was basically a imagery to the life and death battle he was having while his daughter was sitting by his bedside reading the hero book they drew perhaps thats why his dream setting was so weird and unique anyways due to the words of his daughter he woke up hence the final punch deleting the king that was taking everything away from himhis friends family world and finally him kinda like death itself and putting an end to his coma the final scene where he was shown as his fat hero self was just explained in the chinese version as him recuperating from his malnourished coma by overeating hope that answers some question

anime,removed,oh the thing with the mom dna test yeah that was sad but had quite the orgasmic ending
anime,removed,i mean if we want to throw it back goku snapping on frieza and going super saiyan was a benchmark moment in my childhood
anime,removed,the japanese version delated minutes and add a new ending you can have a try on the chinese versionno english sub yet but wouldnt be hard to undersdand if you have watched the japanese version
anime,removed,that scene from the latest no lion episode was amazing the music the atmosphere the emotion were all amazing
anime,removed,most disgusting fall anime fags enjoy this
anime,removed,when kaneki realized he was a ghoul in tyoko ghoul
anime,removed,yeah i think its partly meant to hide all the foreshadowing that shes actually really important to the plot

anime,removed,this show is fucking gay downvote i d c
anime,removed,see i like slow pacing and in depth descriptions of how the battles work however i cant recall that much of it only smaller parts like that suicide via gun to mouth minors getting chomped and that tactic to infiltrate the building the rest was focused on eren going saiy i mean titan for half of it battle of trost really should not have been episodes
anime,removed,that man certainly is the queen of social awareness
anime,removed,the part ambulance
anime,removed,corey on the house
anime,removed,animated joseph josuke not yet animated bruno jolyne johnny
anime,removed,small spolier alert i think people should know well it more of a fact that cat person is a guy not a girl
anime,removed,for me it wasnt because he was fat it was because he makes these grand hearted decrees that he will change that he will now be the protector butterfly girl thinks he is andoh wait next episode hes back to timid i cant do anything right i stopped after that new guy came in and blackmailed him with the dumbest fucking thing ever in no way shape or form was that some im trapped with no way out blackmail i just stopped mostly because yet again the mc went back to being a sniveling coward after just finishing the previous episode stating how strong he will become
anime,removed,are you sure its a girl though ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
anime,removed,tbh i think most of the hate was directed towards his initial blackhaired persona probably due to the rather uncomfortable memories he dredged up of shinji ikari and firststage ouma shu at least right now the general consensus for people who are up to date with the story is that his initial attitude was understandable and worth pity rather than scorn but if it wasnt for the absolute hell he later went through and his transformation to motherfucking badass im pretty sure people would continue hating him for being a little bitch simply because that jarring contrast wasnt there to make everyone realize how precious his blackhaired persona really was
anime,removed,cat girl hahahahaha you gonn get mad soon
anime,removed,the end to be continued kinda like todays kagewani episode titled the final battle
anime,removed,future trunks is back theres a thing called black goku and kaioken ssj blue is a thing its awesome
anime,removed,tora will perish along with hakumen no mono at ushio final attempt to destroy hakumen tora impalled himself with the spear running the spear through hakumen
anime,removed,kayaba akihiko
anime,removed,i sure hope this is true getting the sports festival arc so soon would be amazing plus we get to see my boy todoroki shine and get introduced to another
anime,removed,yeah it looks boring and much as i enjoy fanservice anime the monogatari faggot series doesnt appeal to me unless i died
anime,removed,who is rohan
anime,removed,marc kindlen from dundee scotland
anime,removed,hakumens presence in shagakshas body merely mutated his body into part youkai as hakumen gather enough hatred to separate itself from shagaksha kinda like a baby to the ovary relationship once separated shagakshas life is not bound to hakumen in any way
anime,removed,indeed the shit show never ends please enough is enough i dont care about the faggoty shit faced characters and i certainly dont care about the worst waifu in anime fucking kill me if another season presents its cancerous plague among the anime community
anime,removed,ouch is that because of bdsm suit sakura
anime,removed,it wouldve been if they stayed together
anime,removed,the ending is great but the rest of the second half is just kinda slow and seems pointless after ls death i didnt like near and the chocolate dude as much as l
anime,removed,this is a pretty legit scene but my favorite is when he rapes tokyo tower that imo is the true pinnacle of dmc
anime,removed,ecks dee
anime,removed,that scene made me permanently terrified of umbrellas fuck you another uglycry
anime,removed,httpsiimgurcombjuktvnjpg
anime,removed,so do people have to spoiler tag every single character design that changes from episode do you need to spoiler tag pictures of tsukihi with long hair or karen with short hair i mean im not trying to be an ass here i totally get spoiler tagging pictures of character if something like an arm or leg is lost or scars or something but hair color changes so much in anime that its hard to consider it a spoiler it would be similar to spoiler tagging every one piece character post time skip because that would spoil that theres a time skip its just not realistic
anime,removed,going a bit ot i really am super hyped for chapter animated new erens power
anime,removed,the last one
anime,removed,it figures that the guy who wrote guilty crown would put best girl in a httpiimgurcomfkisyrzjpg
anime,removed,ahh hachikuji is such a treasure a really great character i was so sad when she finally disappeared watching this brang tears to my eyes when she said if i was ever in trouble would you help me he tried so hard such a bittersweet moment its why the monagatari series is one of my all time favorite animes
anime,removed,dont worry about it bro smurf and vincent are in a skype chat together where they suck each others dicks off and vote manipulate against people theyre arguing with its not a coincidence that they always appear at the same time when the other is in trouble flairconspiracy
anime,removed,because the majority of anime viewers are year olds and they love their electro shit
anime,removed,if you actually cried over this lul
anime,removed,well this is not the first cramberry test and some of the girls from previous tests were kind of turned into her followers so they continue the tests
anime,removed,that simpleton placed his selfish amusement over the needs of the whole stare
anime,removed,why do swedes support islamist invaders and foreign jihadi rapists
anime,removed,just torrent it from our favorite website named after the japanese onomatopoeia for cat noises streaming inherently has lower bitrate for both video and audio and streaming websites often grab the first release of an episode they can get in order to get the most clicks and ad revenue from people that want to stream it as soon as possible regardless of quality which often results in worse quality than fansubbing groups also if you download anime you can use mpchc a great media player to play it which helps eliminate color and shade banding and scales up lower res video you can even use plugins with it but only if you have a really good computer to play video at
anime,removed,s this would be pretty crazy rem gets attacked by two archbishops on the way back to the capital and gets put into coma and her existence from everyones memories is erased when subaru and emilia have their conversation in the end subaru starts to talk about rem and emilia goes whos rem heh heh would be crazy if this happened heh heh heh
anime,removed,that reminds me of something that joseph joestar did with his arm in a kars accident hint hint
anime,removed,rossiu is chosen by simon as to be the leader of the all the spiral beings of the world he did what had to be done and if the spiral beings do not cause a massive black hole i think the universe will have rossiu to thank for that
anime,removed,fmab is one of those anime that covered almost the every genre lol it had action adventure comedy romance dramaetc and what made it better is the animation it was constant and i dont remember having an episode that had a lower quality than the rest also it done fantastic when animating the fight scenes my only issue is that i am into bittersweet endings thus the old anime ending was more for my taste as for the brotherhood ending it felt somewhat lame to me all the god thing and the moon having an eyeetc but it was a great ride that made me quit anime for a week just to think about the whole episodes
anime,removed,she hunts rogue evil magical girls mary for exemple and at least tries to stop the tests from cramberrys followers
anime,removed,oh yeah the anime has completely avoided anything about margrave or what happens after death what does the wn say about this
anime,removed,d stands s dear
anime,removed,everything continues
anime,removed,lets see how fake it is whens reigen goes not even mob has gone
anime,removed,httpiimgurcomwuoibwbpng lul
anime,removed,mirai nikki did show the beginning though the end of yunos real timeline and the beginning of the timeline we came to know the ending of the anime was in both the and timeline
anime,removed,how can he generate an aura tho
anime,removed,to those who are confusedcurious from the end of the ep i read a bit into ch enough to tell you s reigen isnt the boss he only tricked the small frys into thinking so like the badass he is
anime,removed,margrave has a book that reminds him of whats going on through it he can keep abreast of every return from death he was the one who created the malbeast curse i wont tell you who margrave is though the world continues when he dies which means everything keeps going theyre parallels
anime,removed,i think i saw a clip of nge where the mc is in the center and everyone is clapping i couldnt help but think that is so retarded
anime,removed,guilty crown
anime,removed,plastic memories
anime,removed,angel beats
anime,removed,it isnt very clear cut you will see
anime,removed,maybe scars are just allergic reaction to table salt
anime,removed,birdy the mighty ended with quite a few deaths so i would go with that
anime,removed,white album
anime,removed,im not a manga reader and against my better instincts i read your spoiler could you post s a few of these hints that i could look for in the anime and be totally amazed at id really appreciate it
anime,removed,i cant see a solution where the middle part gets important again you havent considered that everything the group did for kakeru in the middle is part of what helps kakeru in the end that the latest episode is just a relapse you are jumping to some pretty wild conclusions
anime,removed,hahahahahahahahahahhaahahahhahahahahahajahhahahahaha reige u da man
anime,removed,but which clone would you choose
anime,removed,you are in for a treat next week
anime,removed,this is a lie
anime,removed,which megumi
anime,removed,her witch name is kriemhild gretchen i believe if we were to invoke faust we can find that the beginning runes read prolog in himmel which mirrors faust gertrude the name of the first witch is also the gardner in faust finally the ending where madoka becomes a god and leaves homura on earth immediately brings to mind for me how margretgretchen is allowed by god to go to heaven while faust is left to suffer on earth personally i find madoka to be a conglomerate of various german fairy tales wrapped up in a package that parallels faust which might be what makes it seem weak to you i personally believe this is its strongest point but to each their own
anime,removed,i really really hate to say this but pokemon xyz just fits here after what weve seen of both the series and whats about to come its not that the show itself is bad but when it comes down to it it could have been so much greater than what itll be remembered as another peak before a fall pros better animation character arcs and development hints of a canon romance two dragon types and a pretty great team hype for a league victory for ash after almost years the mega evolution specials better team flare arc than in the games what we expected victory amourshipping maybe a new protag in aloha conswhat we are about to get instead a brief moment of awesome in the team flare arc followed by a character and compentency reset for ash as is tradition benching of his alohan team as is tradition amourshipping sunk as is tradition the failure to break away from tradition where it mattered nullified the progress the series made the option to break away from tradition in pursuit of the yokai watch audience doesnt help i hear in some circles the argument that the anime cannot survive without ash as the protag i call bollocks httpbulbapediabulbagardennetwikithelegendofthunder will ash ever become a pokemon master he laughed and fell back on the couch he blatantly said that when ash becomes a pokemon master the show will end it will be the last episode going back to my first interview i did not mention that he stated the show was cyclical because it could be the audience is constantly replaced since children get older and leave and new children come in so they are allowed to get away with having the same repetitive goal so the show would probably continue the same way collect badges travel through different regions never age will ash and pikachu ever be replaced no will they ever age no will there be a generation of pokemon and will the show keep continuing he laughed even harder and said of course pokemon will continue for many generations to come and as he made it sound probably forever i physically cannot wait another years for ash to get close to winning again
anime,removed,if you have an action fan sword of the stranger would be a good pick its been a hot minute since i saw it last but im pretty sure there wasnt anything in it that could be considered fanservice let alone hentai lots of blood and action though i watched it with my dad and he loved it
anime,removed,bitch
anime,removed,sail the high seas nyaa
anime,removed,get cancer
anime,removed,kamina was pretty surprising
anime,removed,the fucking ntr at the end omg
anime,removed,that code geass cliffhanger tho
anime,removed,nice video you can see my animecover her
anime,removed,wait really i just read on kissmanga and i didnt really notice anything wrong
anime,removed,raphiel is raphael and vigne ishttpsenwikipediaorgwikivinedemon i dont actually know if thats supposed to be her or not
anime,removed,top anime funny moments
anime,removed,objectively the cutest
anime,removed,im not implying anything though i do agree that any racewhatever can be racist hell ive seen a white person getting treated badly by a black teacher because she was racist do lost of people really believe it though ive seen more people bitching about hardcore sjws than i have seen hardcore sjws
anime,removed,shinmai maou no testament sure it rammed in a lot of ecchi predicated the entire story on it really but it also delivered a villain whose disguise i didnt see through for way too long it was kind of brilliant in one episode im groaning because this guy youd assume is a background character doing something stupid and nonsensical in a way that just looks like lazy writing to prop up a coincidence for the mc but then it turns out hes the villain of the arc and everything was intentional aside from the tournament setup i have to assume it was better explained in the novels that whole arc seemed awfully rushed the plot made sense in what seemed to be a relatively well planned way for that kind of show
anime,removed,
anime,removed,air and doesnt someone die in clannad guess ill have to get my box of tissues a bottle of some form of alcohol and rewatch
anime,removed,circuit
anime,removed,the anime is a bit mixed the dub is just crap the japanese dub has plenty of filler like placing the doma arc or whatever it is with the seal of orichalos or whatever in the middle of battle city on the way to the kaiba tower and i think the pacing is a bit meh read the manga instead you get the added bonus of homicideyugi aka the original yami yugi who actually dished out those punishments also kaibas feud with yugi makes a lot more sense after seeing the original since by the point where the second anime the one that actually got to stateside theres the so called season thats based on the first parts of the manga starts kaiba has lost to yugi at least once already and mokuba was actually more than just a sidekick he kidnapped yugi and tried to take revenge on him for seto big bro kaiba theyre both kaiba seto just almost never gets called by his first name but youre right that the punishments were tailored for those who were judged like the tv exec who had yugi beat up got his eyes to only see sensormosaic or the guy who forced people to listen to his shitty karaoke singing got deafened by his own heart beat and so on
anime,removed,today is the day when yagami light died haha
anime,removed,howd i know whod be posting just by looking at the title if youre going to be faggot that only comes to ranime to post fanart then stop being a lazy fuck and post an album of every single virgin killer sweater that has been posted instead of trying to cash in on low effort karma but you wont because you only post anything relating to popular series how about you just stick to the subs where fanart should belong instead of being an intolerable hack its not like its hard to compile a onetime album i could do it myself but they are being produced at such a high rate it would drive me mad to keep it updated
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i know that everyone saw the plot twist in erased about the teacher being the killer but i didnt see it coming at all
anime,removed,sh dont tell a certain someone
anime,removed,what makes kazuma even more alpha is the fact that s chris is eriss avatarso he is stole s of a god
anime,removed,what a godly fanart
anime,removed,whats the illness in grisaia and do you recommend the anime i might clicky clicky on gakkougurashi
anime,removed,ill definitely give that a spin at some point it seems interesting though according to my friend the anime left out a lot of evil from the mother to the son
anime,removed,not yet in the anime but it should be addressed eventually since it does come up in the manga
anime,removed,well they do have a chapter about it in the manga so if it is adapted i am assuming it will be you should find out
anime,removed,i love emilia
anime,removed,its time to watch old school anime
anime,removed,subaru even noted he got a strength upgrade when he was transported realism just means consistent worldbuilding and believable characters with agency maybe in the ln its different but in the anime the characters are anything but believable the show shoehorns every motivation by insisting the subaru cares about the other characters when there is rarely ever a bonding moment shown on screen this shows idea of a friendship is subaru spouting autistic nonsense at someones face for about a minute and boom friendship formed and i think the more accurate term is fantasyinspired its all the same for the purposes of this discussion you can call it whatever you want so long as you extend the definition to the entire genre
anime,removed,didnt know i was watching fuuka
anime,removed,httpiimgurcompejsjtzpng
anime,removed,just when you thought couldnt get anymore austistic
anime,removed,jotaro
anime,removed,in terms of dealing with death maybe angel beats its basically about a bunch of kids in the afterlife who have to come to terms with their deaths and regrets and stuff
anime,removed,i know it doesn´t seem like it but nen is bothplus an extra interpretationit´s a reflection of the person´s personality and imaginationsimilar to getbackers
anime,removed,aura is your tool will is indeed the fuel for nen
anime,removed,dont see how you mean the shot of the only light in the room shining directly on her with her eyes and hair sparkling as subaru gazes longingly up at her clearly infatuated as he states that he will protect her at all costs wasnt obvious enough no to treat them as friends it actually works sure but thats not what subaru did he stated it and then continued spewing autistic garbage maybe that is how subaru treats his friends but if you expect me to believe that it would actually make other people like him youre delusional emilia didnt want subaru anywhere near the royal meetup cause she knew he would fuck something up now this is just dishonest that scene doesnt happen until well after emilia clearly considers him a friend she just doesnt want him there because she knows he is overprotective of her and will cause a scene
anime,removed,lol throw me in a thread about code geass and doot away
anime,removed,the bus accident thing on szs had so much potential its just sad they only used it as jokes then there is the manga ending which is completely out of left field compared to everything before it
anime,removed,firstly its portraying figure skating pretty realistically scores are a bit inflated compared to real life but several rl figure skaters such as and have been watching and enjoying the show the animation quality of the performances is admittedly a bit shoddy secondly its fujobait that actually paid off yeah theres some ambiguity still but the two romantic leads literally exchanged rings and got engaged in episode little hard to nohomo your way out of that its certainly not perfect but the characters are likeable and the relationship between the two mcs has been portrayed well if a bit speedy though the gay relationship is a major draw to the series it isnt the main focus of the show ultimately you still feel drawn into the drama and tension surrounding the sport
anime,removed,goku super saiyans god tee just how to order select the style and color you want click the green button buy it now select size and quantity enter shipping and billing information tips buy or more to save shipping cost
anime,removed,love how miyu is included especially s since she is also an emiya
anime,removed,its in the sakura sex scene iirc
anime,removed,somebody pls tell me its not a dude
anime,removed,thats a bit harsh i think of him a lot like mochizou the orbiting childhood friend who is in love with a girl thats never even considered the two in a romantic light but when he actually confesses she realises that shes had dormant feelings and cared about him all along because hes been such a rock in her life among other things i wouldnt be surprised if hibike ended in a similar fashion to tmtls in that regard
anime,removed,oh shounen you know that makes an awful lot of sense because shounen animes always seem to remove any potential gay stuff and make sure it wont be properly included like i was overly convinced that sai was gay and wanted to see him get a boyfriend then he instead eventually got together with a girl and its the most awkwardly contrived pairing too with someone that doesnt even make sense for him to get together with the closest we got to anyone gay in naruto was haku and well he died early on as we all know xp
anime,removed,i love how akio and sanae basically adopt tomoya straight away its really sweet
anime,removed,why call them seiyuus and not voice actors im not a weeb so i had to look up what that meant
anime,removed,trigger girls i think you mean luluco
anime,removed,to i wanted minori to win qq
anime,removed,i would agree with you that the ending while action packed was also pretty generic but the final moments surounding kyouka caught me in the feels and took what was just a good ending and made it great imo
anime,removed,the anime has currently covered the volumes and a bit of vol the gryps festa arc was concluded in the recently released vol the mystery of ayatos sister is still left unexplained where i believe the author is saving any major plot reveals for the lindvolus festa arc which he has yet to write
anime,removed,theres quite a surprise waiting for you that wasnt in the anime
anime,removed,theres the clearly pandering incest plot a bad antagonist and the fact that of the things that happened inside alo happened for no real reason why did kirito have to use illusiontransformation magic to become a giant monster why did he have to fight against one of the top players in the game i mean sure what he did was pretty cool looking but it quite literally added nothing to a the rescue plot b the incest plot c sugahas alo subplot it didnt even characterize kirito or sugaha or if it did not very much its been established in sao that kirito is extremely strong and competent you could say they happened for worldbuilding reasons except even in the light novels aloside chapters at best only mention the characters involved in passing
anime,removed,saber vs lan fan this is going to be a close one lan fan is going to need a hand to win this one
anime,removed,the best guy poll really confuses me because joeseph and gintoki are and but they never seem to get very far in the best guy contests
anime,removed,dont go popping a boner on top of my head guts or ive got until dawn to kill every last one of you guts or grifffffffiiiittthhhhhh guts
anime,removed,i started watching attack on titan but then dropped it at around four or five episodes in just couldnt get into it i felt like it was a shonen series trying too hard to be gory and gritty just fell flat and tryhardy to me erased couldnt get past the first episode so thing about the whole ima just run away from my moms murder scene after my neighbor blindly accuses me of being the one that did it really bugged me gave me a really bad impression on how the logicdeprived the main character is dont tell me it made more sense in the manga i like to take on a cinemasins approach to judging an anime as in i look at it from face value and ignore any source material i mean if i wanted to read the manga then id read the manga durara just didnt do anything for me the monogatari series there too many different series with slightly differing names made it hard to keep track of what i have and havent watched one punch man online hypetrains kill the mood for me sometimes this is one of those situations also i dont know where i can watch it subbed did funi get the sub right havent really bothered to check tbh prison school just no
anime,removed,

anime,removed,death note l dies and shitty people named mello and near take over and try to catch kira
anime,removed,i have a feeling that this poll is heavy foreshadowing on the best girl pollcivil warsalt mine going on right now
anime,removed,so where is the sp scene
anime,removed,community deserves a full break down of specifically why he is banned from what i can tell were being denied to ability to discuss with digi on the boards because certain mods have undue animosity towards him this seems to be the consensus of the community if this is incorrect then discuss it with us and show us what is correct if what i said is correct then stop abusing your power
anime,removed,tokoyami is the dark horse
anime,removed,i want a season so we can see his manga spoilers obviously

anime,removed,it annoys the hell out of me that fanservice became a synonym for nudity and sexual content in anime community it got to the point where people talk about fanservice during rape scene in the third knk movie by which they mean that there are nipples visible on the screen not every sexual content is fanservice and not every fanservice is sexual content everything can be fanservice it just has to be made mainly to pander to fans its in the friggin name people
anime,removed,it worked with kars
anime,removed,he pretty much hooked up with the little girl he was raising sine she was like or how is that not messed up
anime,removed,this is great d does anyone have a torrent megas speeds are all over the place so downloading the zip is out of the question
anime,removed,uhhhhhhkūjo and victorique if that doesnt count because its already happened then id go allen and road from dgrayman
anime,removed,arc is going to break so many people
anime,removed,just finished the episode wow they skipped a lot the three stooges getting a whole army of thugs back to the alleyway and rem showing up to beat the living daylights out of them also they skipped how subaru got in along with a long scheme of smuggling onto a cart theyre unimportant details though
anime,removed,but i cant believe they skipped als reveal i find it weird he lightly acknowledged the kansai accent comment subaru threw out yet subaru didnt even realize
anime,removed,the reason he is weakening now isnt as much because of his injury but because of deku inheriting one for all
anime,removed,
anime,removed,yes youre supposed to feel like that about subaru at this point
anime,removed,nice episode but im kind of salty that they completely skipped a very important scene where al tells subaru that he is from another world as well
anime,removed,you have no idea
anime,removed,well it didnt work out when boros tried it
anime,removed,bishop death dark soulsy incoming
anime,removed,the anime skipped why he knows what that dialect is think about it
anime,removed,he already has fucked up hes fucked up so bad with this that hes going to be the prime target for political moves against emilia which will end in his torture and death
anime,removed,well torture and death you really dont want to know any more than that
anime,removed,aww i thought subaru was going to get punched in the gut by felt at the end just like the
anime,removed,alright so if someone is wondering how much time has passed its around one month since the events of episode they sped up pacing for this episode and the rest of volume they pretty much have to adapt it within episodes so that they can adapt the other volumes properly since the volume is mainly the intro for arc without a lot of majorly important scenes this is honestly the best choice now let me add some information that the anime didnt address in detail but which is okay the moment when subaru rode the carriage and suddenly flew away when he raised his arm was the divine blessing of the earth dragon the beast that is used as some kind of horse divine blessings are pretty much passive abilities that every being can be born with theyre extremely rare but some animal species and royal bloodlines have them felt for example has the blessing of the wind the earth dragon has the divine blessing of wind resistance meaning that in a certain space around it wind pressure doesnt exist another example is reinhard who has a load of blessings yes he is op arrow avoidance he cannot be hit by projectiles this is why sword that elsa threw went around him on its own magic resistance no curses can affect him swiftness he can move at superhuman speed this affects mounts as well initiative he cannot be ambushed and all initial attacks from reinhardt connects first attack immunity the first time an attack is performed at reinhardt it always misses preceding attack immunity the second attack and all following attacks misses him mind reading vague understanding of whats on other peoples mind blessing of lake can walk on water illness immunity immune to all sickness and disease power bleeding bleeding actually makes him stronger blessing of the phoenix upon death he is granted a continue once to name a few ferris and willhelm appeared at the mansion im glad they brought that in yes ferris is a guy and yes willhelm is a relative to reinhard he also has the title of the sword demon and i love him next is some info on priscilla since we have some new characters here some extra info from the side stories they wont appear in the main story nor do they spoiler any future events the side story plays at the same time as where the main story currently is she is under but was married times already almost all of her husbands died because of mysterious reasons she can make fire bend to her will one time priscilla stole als sword and held it at his throat to show him that she could kill him whenever she wanted priscilla apparently has a joy in watching young boys cry some quotes well its true and when i say it it becomes even more true than it already was dont rush me may you commoners instead lose track of time as you steal glances at me and are entranced by my beauty i dont understand did you al bring me another man to fck me because youre too weak to do so yourself i suppose i should appreciate you for bringing me a handsome boytoy but really this toy boy was boring to her so she sliced him in two just like that al what did you do priscilla he just sort of died inside man al do you really think that answer will work priscilla shrug im surprised that they didnt show the reveal of al i strongly believe they will rearrange it though at last we have the other queen candidates anastasia crusch my favorite female character priscilla and felt well this was pretty much a set up episode and more like a bridge for future events i know why they want to get over with it as fast as possible since the major events happen in volume and later still i got to say whoever does these backgrounds knows what hes doing the character designs are also perfect and the va do a very good job tappei himself said that he could listen to priscillas voice forever and that he loves how al has a kinda muffled tone due to his helmet
anime,removed,most likely felix calls him the sword demon and reinhard is the sword saint so either astrea is a family name or maybe a title given to those accomplished with the sword
anime,removed,
anime,removed,finished season of rurouni kenshin the series started out pretty rough i thought glad i stuck with it shishiho and friends really stole the show in this arc i love how they live in semifeudal japan i guess yet they still have one guy who sounds like hes from wyoming or some backwoods southern state s shishio his girlfriend i guess and his most loyal servant all reuniting in hell in a large field of skeletons planning to overthrow and take over hell before walking off into the sunset made me burst out into laughter perfect ending for shishio his plans may have been foiled but that wont stop him from having his way
anime,removed,episode of nge when goes berserk and consumed the engine fmab when fu and greed and that other guy fight bradley
anime,removed,gintama started with the monkey hunter arc one of the funniest arcs ive ever watched binged all the way to the end of yoshiwara in flames which was such high quality the whole way through loved the introduction of tsukuyo kamui and abuto and it was cool to see kagura snap for once i feel like gintoki is always the one getting serious but kaguras fight against abuto was quality loved the conclusion to the arc as well especially with gintoki casually surviving the most ridiculous shit against the king of yato this show just keeps on getting better even though ive had it rated as a since the benizakura arc
anime,removed,it was a cool fight and entertaining but that guy did no damage at all to saitama
anime,removed,hiro lives right

anime,removed,i mean s some people want to have kids so having unprotected sex with the guy you love and having a kid isnt really that much of a problem
anime,removed,dem son
anime,removed,i stop watching after gon easily kill nerferpitou
anime,removed,im the same i originally caught up to the series at the end of the chimera ant arc which pulls so much shit out of that queens ass its ridiculous only to end on an even worse asspull like really youre taking entire episodes to explain the complex wishgranting system all its rules but then he loves killua so much that theyre free for him and people buy that fucking tiger can borrow powers for one hour after helping them that octopi couple can play darts on people after tagging them why isnt the tagging the weapon isnt that the hardest part fucking poison that shit or something dead killua jikan desu all that shit is eyerolling and no amount of explaining your nen system can make up for the fact that these powers are made up shit and then you have a guy who runs fast how is the smokey guy going to catch a guy running fast oh noes that final fight against cell was awesome what a massproduced bomb killed the guy at his weakest point this series is dark guys people actually die dude the series starts off with hundreds of guys running for two days straight over of them are able to do achieve this feat and then half of them are killed in that foggy area by a perverted clown thats not dark thats fucking dumb the only notable arc in the end was york new its villains were easily the most interesting but were largely ignored past that and the final episode yggdrasil lets expand this boring world because we run out of ideas
anime,removed,the alluka part is the worst part of the show imo and honestly i wasnt a fan of gons powerup against pitou either yes there was severe repercussions but he just happened to get the power to beat pitou where there was no other conceivable way of him beating her i just dont like the idea of getting op nen abilities even with the conditions the whole thing reeked of deus ex machina chimera ant overall was a mixed bag for me with yorknew easily being the best arc although that seems to be a pretty popular opinion overall though i still enjoyed it quite a bit and would rate it a

anime,removed,antiracists are the real racists right lol calling yourself a progressive and supporting trump who is looking to appoint known racists young earth creationists and climate change deniers in government not to mention all the big bankers drain the swamp a billionaire who has the attention span of a child and is a known bully and scumbag is president of the united states how you are representing yourself simply oozes holierthanthou because youre so fucking enlightened for supportingwhat exactly not hillary get over yourself dude and stop spreading bullshit on ranime

anime,removed,you can hate both hillary and trump and their supporters thats what i do and its working out just fine youre not some ideologicallypure freedom fighter bud youre just another shitposter
anime,removed,i honesty like these short scenes of kumiko and shuu this show has been about dont live your high school life without any regrets vs its time to move on the most obvious one from this season is asuka vs typical asian mother but there was also reina and her desire to play solo and be special takisensei and fulfilling his wifes dream kumiko and her being honest in what she wants and so on but the very first example was shuu and his love for kumiko while everyone has taken the former choice shuu was the only one had moved on or is attempting to this is evident because of how he has recently been forcing himself a distance away from her compared earlier in the show when he tried to talk to her everyday ride the subway back with her playing band and specifically picking the instrument her sister used to play ect it sets a huge contrast from those who picked the former and those who pick the latter also shuu is probably one of the most relatable characters in this show loving a girl you knew for a long time but she doesnt love you back that shit hits you times harder than truckkun

anime,removed,mate hanekawa is the worst girl in the show
anime,removed,
anime,removed,in the manga there were chapters a little past this point he actually calms down and asked felixs escort wilhelm to train him
anime,removed,a comment from a user on a streaming site well so some rearrangements and cuts were done but its nothing too major i think i will have to talk about some extra info from the novels so bear with me please first of all the anime made roswaal more suspicious than he is supposed to be in the ln he declares that emilia could function as a scapegoat which of course enraged subaru after roswaal tries to take action against him puck intervenes and puts everyone in the throne room to his place he says that he could freeze everyone to death in mere seconds if he wanted but only emilia holds him back obviously this was only a deception to draw out emilias power by doing that she put some respect into the people around her and finally got accepted as a candidate yet her background still was not well seen anyway lets get to the episode dont blindly hate julius now sure one of his reasons for this whole duel was because he tried to protect his and the others honor as a knight but this had also another reason by publicly shaming subaru he basically saved him from a worse fate if subaru took one step outside of the palace the knights would have dragged him into the next alley and kill him on the spot you saw the despising looks of the knights towards him yep that so by giving him an acceptable punishment that is not lethal julius actually saved him now to the candidate the anime kept their declaration of their will rather short so ill go a bit more detail on that first of priscilla well priscilla believes that the kingdom is made to serve her and that she is the only possible choice since she is always on the winner side priscilla had husbands already and all of them died after their death she was always able to turn their land into one of the valuable prosperities there is and through that she gained an immense amount of influence in the kingdom her catchphrase is that she is really good at guessing and that the world is revolving around her will her argument is basically join me and you will be on the winners side next is crusche she has a more radical plan for this kingdom crusch doesnt see any sense in following the dragon anymore she gives a good argument in the manga so ill quote that „dependance brings birth to stagnation which brings birth to corruption and corruption eventually brings destruction people around her are shocked about this because the carsten house has been loyal and close with the royal family for decades now one would think that the head of said house would do everything to please the dragon and fulfill the prophecy so in short she means that they should free themselves from the dependance on the dragon and take their life into their own hand at last there is anastasia anastasia grew up in kararagi where money is basically everything its an economic superpower and people without connections or capabilities in trading will not survive there anastasia worked her way up from the bottom and she developed some kind of unhealthy sense of greed she earns to own more and more when she reaches a milestone it leaves her unsatisfied and she craves for even more which eventually led to her wanting an entire kingdom julius tries to pledge for her even further by arguing that she is one of the best people when its about economics and since this kingdom is in a financial crisis she is the best suited person to lead lugunica into a bright future well emilias declaration could be interpreted in many ways what i clearly hear from her words is equality this equality could applied to many different areas but i think the most logical one is racial equality you know about years prior to these events a racial war waged in this kingdom although this war has ended decades ago there are still consequences within the general population its clear that emilia is the victim of countless racist comments of course this is due to her resemblance with satella but i cant shake off the feeling that this goes even a little bit further than that now to the ending scene well this was the perfect example to show the beautiful characterization in this story first off yes youre supposed to think subaru you deserved this tho yes you can disagree with his actions and if you see faulty in his behavior you and to call him out on that then please do so this is all intentional by the author and he wants you to think freely this is no story where you have to support the protagonists decisions and behavior no matter what no the author is conscious that subaru is faulty from head to toe he knows that and he punishes subaru by taking the most important thing of this world from him to me thats beautiful characterization that isnt linear towards a positive progress if people are backed into a corner provoked and absolutely desperate then they tend to fall back into old patterns imagine an alcoholic that managed to stay clean for months but then suddenly a close person to him died the risk is high that this person is completely overwhelmed by his emotions and thought and eventually stars to drink again this a rather crazy comparison but you get where im coming from subarus character made a jump back in progression but that doesnt mean this isnt progression at all sometimes falling back into your old behavior opens a new door a new chance for you to change oh and let me talk about how humane subaru became by becoming absolutely selfish we expected him to save other people because he wants to and like protagonist number he didnt want anything for it he is happy because the others are safewell thats not how real life works and the author knows that all this time and deep inside subaru had these selfish thoughts but he locked them away now when he became probably the most desperate he has ever been all these build up selfish emotions came to the surfacethe thing is if the other person doesnt remember any of these events then it comes off like how emilia saw it in this scene these are humane interaction and i love them his return by death and these hands are more cruel than ever before for anyone curious the next episodes title was revealed in a magazine since we would have heard about it on friday anyway here a little heads up it is a disease known as despair sounds good huh arc is coming to get us
anime,removed,so in rare cases animals can get quirks but weve only seen one so far in both the anime and the manga humans can also have body mutation type quirks like tailkid and the cat policeman
anime,removed,and then theres saber whos not even willing to destroy one measly world to get that happy ending the choice is clear
anime,removed,i got a bunch of shit this week so for my birthday i got httpiimgurcomqoriyfzjpg revive guncannon revive gm thunderbolt ver mkii revive aeug colours lightning zeta later in the week i got my glorious as well as some mg hyakushiki barbatos hg gaeon httpiimgurcomtcdvihnjpg also arrived this week finally my last package was just some sd wing gundam mg sandrock
anime,removed,why would he be jealous when hes the original owner of one for all quirk and he gave it to a quirkless guy because he pitied him
anime,removed,ya fuck that shit if you grew up with computer games youre a fucking anarchist and say whatever the fuck you want only once you graduate from school and start working at a real job do you realize theres a social hierarchy if emilia tan was someone i wanted to protect id say fuck everybody i dont give a shit if youre a royal or a knight but maybe thats just me nah i doubt it you see the shit people say online in games this generation is unfiltered unhinged unless you live under a rock or maybe its because we live under one and never have exposure to the real world
anime,removed,sorry mate theyre not but there is one guy that hella jelly of all might
anime,removed,httpsgfycatcomspectacularrepentantlamprey for now
anime,removed,true but i guess the remainder of the autumn election arc will be quite a bit shorter than what it was in the manga s stagiare will probably be a bit shorter as well
anime,removed,i would be fine with this s if they didnt spoil the arc after the tournament
anime,removed,yes but seeing as the most recent manga cover is s miyabi holding genesis i believe the anime has caught up to the manga
anime,removed,why does it look like kazuma is slowly transforming to s rance this worries me but im also intrigued
anime,removed,season had its problems too that whole segment with scount cruhteo asking slaine to forgive him was pretty dumb
anime,removed,you gotta be a sad lonely desperate mother fucker to buy one of these or the figures that come out creepy pedophile shit

anime,removed,kiznaiver too soon i watched episodes and then and it just never got better every character in this anime is a singlesided bland archetype which is spelled out in the first episode the story then focuses on the budding romance between two featureless painless emotionless high school students why why would you write a romance story about such awful bland characters the season finale is a minute meaningless conversation with such topics as are we friends still maybe iunno did the kizna system make us friends did we always have the potential to be friends maybe iunno did we come together through the magical power of friendship or just this crazy pseudoscience lolwhocares
anime,removed,im broke af
anime,removed,ah i just use kiss anime i bought vip way back when and its lasted years i torrent sometimes but i try to not so it so much com cast cap is now but last week i blew gb in days xx
anime,removed,only first volume is translated iirc
anime,removed,jeez when the show started i saw a lot of comments teasing about how much subaru was going to suffer later in the story so i was kinda expecting more unfortunate deaths and body mutilations etc but i definitely didnt think it would be this kind of suffering fuck were only half done with this show and at the start of this arc chill nothing indicates that this will be the only type of suffering to be precise this isnt even the actual suffering its more like a preparation
anime,removed,people asked for suffering and they got it some may lose an eye others may lose a limb we are losing heart
anime,removed,yeah thats exactly what i felt too also i had a feeling same to when lelouch died
anime,removed,so fuuko is a ghost how can she be a ghost if shes alive in the hospital shes in between life and death right now i got some chills when she said she was almost hit by a car i went oh shit the first time i watched that scene
anime,removed,torrent it
anime,removed,i feel like ive seen an episode of two of this show before is this the one where that recluse girl scratches stars out of wood with her fingernails
anime,removed,do it go in blind youre in for some serious tsukishima ride smughaikyuu

anime,removed,well first the court is fucked up second emotions third he was being degraded consistently also emotional trauma that said subaru will receive torture like never before fairly soon
anime,removed,suzaku from code geass really irritating me in and most of s i understand why he worked with the empire but i just see him as a hypocrite he says he doesnt want people to die yet hes with a group of people who terrorises other terroities around the world and kill innocent civilians at least with the black knights they kill soldiers who are prepared to die in battle anyway there was a time where innocent civilians died and shirleys father died as well but the empires army are far worse he only became redeemable when he worked with lelouch in the end i may be biased because i kept changing my opinions of characters whenever they were with or against lelouch

anime,removed,shiny chariots identity seems canonically a mystery the audience clearly knows its sucy
anime,removed,man i wish i had the time to write a full rebuttal to your review its nice seeing the perspectives others especially those that contradict your own if theres bit id like to pick a bone with you is with this show is so selfabsorbed and unaware of its ridiculousness that when a fourteen year old says i love you you are supposed to actually take it seriously as if he found his soul mate its a joke blonde girl only said i love you in the letter in the end which make sense for someone who thinks they are going die in a few days arima says he thinks the feeling is love but says the feeling akin to gratitude
anime,removed,hmm seems like theyll keep the plot of witches hating chariot this may add some deep to dianas character as a child who was disappointed by her idol
anime,removed,ive literally just been shitting here because of this fucking anime if it can be called anime gintama gave me diarrhea the fanbase of gintama is so rotten and disgusting everytime theres a new episode the fucking fanboys are like omg not even seen it but

anime,removed,while you are correct romance is more of a central tag to the anime itself sao both cours heavily focused on the romantic relationship between asuna and kirito and how significant they become in each others lives it doesnt exactly answer the ops question though as romance is a pretty prime part of the show now working on the other hand is a comedysol anime with a romantic subplot that eventually becomes main plot fits the ops question better but yes asunakirito are one of the best pairings ive ever seen in anime extremely intimate and strong bond between the two
anime,removed,there was plenty of development for asuna and kirito infact some of their dialogue is some of the strongest stuff ive seen in an actionromance anime they originally werent getting along well but through shared experiences and teamwork they slowly bonded granted much of the development of feelings of love happened inbetweenoffscreen it was still there it may not feel like it because most anime were used to show the chase but not the actual couple in a relationship in this case we get more of the latter s asunas speech to the fisherman right before they return to the frontlines basically puts their shared experiences into perspective its also a very powerful speech that demonstrates how impactful the few insignificant moments with kirito were in asunas eyes its like for the first time i was glad that i was herekirito means everything to me hes proof im alive in the context of the world of sao and how terrifying things were this invoked a powerful emotional response from me these words really put into perspective how important kirito was to her finding joy in life when you were solely focused on escaping the prison if virtual reality i considered this to be one of the most iconic moments in sao particularly because it has a strong emphasis on one of the main underlying themes no matter if youre in the real or virtual world youre still alive and breathing so never stop to be thankful for and appreciate the fact that youre still alive hope that puts it into context for you an alternative perspective from someone who still after watching so many romance titles and reading so many romance manga still considers sao to be one of the more enjoyable romance anime out there particularly the kirito x asuna pairing anyway
anime,removed,oh yeah you can look at it that way too its just that i personally found sao to be enjoyable largely due to how great the asuna x kirito pairing was also i just check anime tags and assumed that the op was looking for an anime that didnt include an explicit romance tag eg steins gate working while still having a romance subplot its still a good recommendation for romance fans who would like to actually see a couple and their interactioms rather than the same old chase for the entire series and only end up being a couple for as the series ends quite refreshing in comparison to the bulk of romance shows at least in my perspective
anime,removed,from log horizon i have rewatched the anime a multitude of times for that one minute scene alone the rest of the anime is great as well but that episode gives me chills op great scene as well definitely in my personal top
anime,removed,oh boy another batshit backstory so your parents die in a car crash so you walk off into the forest alone find a giant tree and start climbing up touch a glowing plant and get given magic powers but now you have to save the world

anime,removed,watched days expected dumb kid chasing revenge got western theme mafia story of a cunning and evil boy who succeeds in his revenge planning and does it so in a spine chilling manner
anime,removed,they have more resemblance than that s at the ending
anime,removed,i dont think a lot of them are good at social interaction though kirito sao wasnt hachiman oregairu certainly wasnt kazuma konosuba wasnt subaru rezero isnt particularly good either but has the confidence from his return by death ability and this is where i object to the whole no redeemable traits bit some characters might be a bit onedimensional but characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities are few and far between one that comes to mind is makoto from school days a common trait they have is a sense of loyalty andor tenacity and a lot of them at least have some cooking skills girls generally like someone whos dependable and kind to them and cooking skills are a major selling point seriously its a skill worth learning irl trust me

anime,removed,gankutsuou i remember asking for a beautiful anime this anime has such weird designs and visuals but cant deny they are beautiful its basically a retelling of the count of monte cristo but with aliens powers and a shit load of other stuff if you know the basic story you know what to expect revenge etc etc however it was really well done i was originally going to give it an but i had to drop it down to a score why did i deduct one point everything was going smoothly scheming manipulation lying character growth and revenge check check check check and check and of course some romance and tragedy this is a good anime im glad im watching it and wait goes backwhy are they fighting in giant robots what the fuck i know this sounds weird considering they are aliens and shit on spaceships traveling through the universe so it shouldnt be odd but it felt out of place to me also it looks really clumsy luckily it wasnt that long only but besides that i loved it magi the kingdom of magic i thought the original was pretty average it wasnt brilliant or terrible but in the middle now the second season i enjoyed much more i liked how it was split in the beginning and came together my only real problem was the complete lack of morgiana i understood why sinbad couldnt get much screen time but it felt like the writers forgot about morg until the very end i give it a score working really enjoyed this anime i love all the wacky characters and the setting which is only a restaurant the comedy is well done my only problem is inami punching males every episode i know she has a fear of guys but it got really old score working basically everything i said about season but they really toned down on inami punching people so i rate it slightly higher i forgot to mention this earlier but the main characters sisters are hilarious especially izumi now im just hoping some of these couples get together mainly satou and yachiyo please if anyone gets together it needs to be these two score mushishi season too put it simply put i loved this anime and some of the parts i enjoyed the most i also disliked this anime is very chill and slow there is almost no action or fighting but there is conflict the opening song is one of my favorites and it really sets the mood for the show the anime is episodic none of the episodes really relate to each other and each episode stands on its own this is great for watching in segments you can watch episodes at a time or between series and you wont miss a thing however im a fan of big grand arcs so episodic episodes made it hard to watch sometimes i could only watch so many episodes where the mc helps each random person each episode before i had to watch something else however the next day i would suddenly wonder what does ginko do the next episode so i would watch before other anime also love ginkos backstory score mushishi hihamukage score currently watching texhnolyze episode not far into the anime but im enjoying it also by enjoying i mean its making me depressed and sad as fuck im going to have to balance out some moe anime to get through this though i love how the anime is being told mostly through story and little dialogue well at least the first few episodes will finish itno idea mushishi season episodes still early but it looks like nothing really changed overall however it does feel like the second season so far has been a lot darker compared to season one also its impressive they kept the quality of the show considered they were made roughly years apart will probably have it finished by the end of the day working episodes pretty much the same as the first two seasons but they are showing a lot of the characters we previously didnt see before also more development is a good thing also i believe this is the last season besides the special so i hope it has a definite end and not a cliffhanger will have it finished by tomorrow
anime,removed,more memories of it are coming back after reading the plot summary and no i didnt really spoil any major plot points that i can think of there were a few like i mentioned but nothing major at least none that i can think of except maybe the cult

anime,removed,ah the irregular at magic high school or as i call it how do i detest ye let me count the ways tatsuya shiba is a course student in the leading magician school and is accompanied by his sister and course student miyuki who in her first scenes in the first episode gives off a serious brocon vibe now the school is set up such that the course students get more resources teachers access etc than course because they are better at manipulating magic as tested in the magical practical part of the entrance tests the lns and anime here set it up such that tatsuya is disadvantaged from the getgo in both the high school clique sense course students looking down on him and other course students because every high school anime needs a malfoy or a diana and in the sense of ability being theoretically weaker than other course students furthermore the magic system is such that the ability to use it depends partially on genetics and bloodlines so there is an eugenic element to this system that reeks of classism this first arc the enrollment arc should look like a setup for tatsuya to be opposing this system for its inherent unfairness and very real prejudice right problem the fake underdog as one continues watching the show the above setup evaporates and collapses remember what i said about tatsuya having pretty low magic capacity despite his top theoretical scores well lets just say he kinda blows that fact out of the water again without spoiling too much about his character he is a bonafide genius magical engineer who understands and can visualise the intricacies of spells and develop ways to immediately counter them basically most of his battles are brief they also involve a curb stomp problem the authorial mouthpiece tatsuya perpetuates the system in his implicit acceptance of it because zero fucks given is sort of a step up from whinyuselessperverted cancel where applicable harem protag i cant say i disagree per say but there needs to be a balance people the plot features students who do oppose the system but then s surprise its all a plot by ebil terrorists who used brainwashing and stuff to try and steal highlevel research papers the leader of the clique of blooms gets his ass kicked in by tatsuya in less than seconds a single line from tatsuya makes mibu sayaka one of the proequality students break down and cry with the words and i quote s the one who despises you the most for being a weed is you yourself there is some severe logical hoops one needs to jump through in order to agree with tatsuya here the discrimination isnt real which it totally is with the unequal resources and manpower allocation in the school even if the discrimination is real you are the one to blame for most of it which isnt true since the anime went to such pains to show the blooms discrimination and general dickery towards tatsuya but of course mibu breaks down and cries because tatsuya is obviously right and sasuga oniisama s basically the enrollment arc ended with tatsuya or rather satou tsutomu via tatsuyas mouth saying that equality cant exist and that discrimination is largely the fault of the weak but its okay because tatsuya is tatsuya and sasuga oniisama right problem mega mesovore omega prime the fine folks at spacebattlescom came up with a derogatory term for main character who steals agency of other characters in reference to kirito from sao mesovore or agency vampire if kirito is a mesovore tatsuya is the mega evolution of its final evolution with haxed stats and maxed ivs and protean as its ability it gets worse going in to the nine schools competition arc episode had a cliffhanger where the bus bringing the students to their hotel are attacked by a car full of terrorists which is intent on crashing into the bus with no survivors come episode guess who stopped the car go on and then because he wasnt special enough s hes the silver half of taurus silver master magitech programmer hes got super speed he invented flying magic in one episode and we havent gotten into his s bs magician powers seriously thats the actual acronym for bornspecialised although bull shit would also be appropriate considering how overpowered tatsuya is even by bs standards grinds teeth problem incest railroading or incest is not wincest remember the discrimination of weed students by blooms turns out its not universal in tatsuyas case because he almost immediately gets a harem of bloom students orbiting him like hes a celestial body black hole it gets resolved but in my opinion the solution is worse than the problem im going to quote the wt thread by urainbowflygon on this apparently emotionless towards everyone but his sister there being a very good reason for this he is the epitome of overpowered badasses on another note the harem aspect that initially seems to be the case is dealt with beautifully and efficiently for the reason mentioned above which will satisfy those of you who dislike them basically the entire thing is set up for an incest end inherently there isnt a problem per say but this means that the series needs to overcome the public perception of incest and convince the audience and me that miyuki is best girl it hasnt in my case calling tatsuya shiba badass is like calling a mma fighter badass for beating the crap out of a old loli who has no powers whatsoever and stealing her ice cream giving the girl multiple fractures and making her a tetraplegic
anime,removed,s i got a bit past kaminas death
anime,removed,shes a shitty person initially and then she becomes better she fucking headbutts him in the last scene when he finally finds her
anime,removed,its a great show probably best this season imo
anime,removed,yup i looked it up more and its even in the show s death feedback operated on the following principles when the mind recognizes that the user is attempting to harm another human their pk subconsciously activates and stops the functions of the kidney or parathyroid this results in symptoms such as discomfort heart palpitations and sweating which can be intensified through education conditioning and hypnosis at this stage most people would stop attacking but if they continued tetanic asphyxia caused by low blood calcium or cardiac arrest caused by a rapid spike in potassium concentration would kill them
anime,removed,yep theres also a part where she says i feel like ive been born minutes ago when theyre talking about forgetting the past s this takes a whole different meaning when you know what she actually is she doesnt have middleelementary school memories she only came into existence recently
anime,removed,im going to say it western cosplay is way better than japanese cosplay

anime,removed,hey guys im back thanks to everyone for keeping things alive here and to uwingsoflight for holding the fort nyc was a blast i had to pleasure to pass by the iconic midtown comics while i was there and secured myself an httpiimgurcomyghmvhejpg from ibo and an httpiimgurcombpdpobjjpg from unicorn so close though that was after a lot of deliberation since they had basically an entire wall dedicated to gunpla there as per i quickly binged it before i left in order to make the threads and wowwee how well did it hold up you know a show hits a tender spot for you when hearing the op in the first episode makes you bawl and the second time around made so much of the early stuff have so much more impact this show was just an absolute treasure still feel bad about not being able to engage with you guys for it but life where we go from here tomorrow july we start or as fans have nicknamed it notable as being the only animated early uc spinoff not set during the oyw takes us a few years before the events of zeta and gives us a unique look into a postwar gundam setting we havent quite seen before or since as with the other shows in this section can also be watched without a lot of franchise knowledge but is a bit more franchise dependant than previous entries reminder turn a gundam the penultimate entry in our rewatch is effectively the endall to basically all gundam continuities while its not required to have seen any au watching the ones will help bolster your appreciation for the franchises swan song these include afterwar gundam x mobile fighter ggundam and gundam wing s should i keep including this reminder
anime,removed,i really like how s maria read the fiend story in this episode and next episode shun reads one about a karma demon
anime,removed,streaming pirated stuff is bad torrent it instead
anime,removed,i love how the story keeps teasing at a potential pro baseball career for azuma that way to him baseball is everything in life and he has set his sights on it being his life goal a long time ago if he wasnt so dead set in his love for baseball he probably would have had more of a chance with aoba but i have a feeling even koushien wont be enough for him in the future
anime,removed,doot for her 🎺🎺🎺
anime,removed,can you pm some of those sites
anime,removed,sword art vs fate series
anime,removed,too bad he died
anime,removed,though both do die at the end lelouch actually reaches his goal and saves the japanese people from the grasps of britannia
anime,removed,upurplepinapples chihayafuru note i finished season two as well but im just going to cover the first season here chihayafuru is pretty cool it turns an obscure outside of japan at least card game about hitting cards with japanese poems into the foundation for a very enjoyable anime even i wanted to learn to play karuta after i finished watching the karuta games are tense and exciting the show did a great job of throwing in unexpected developments and not lessening the intensity of the karuta games even in games where the outcome is obvious chihayas development as a karuta player is also excellent s throughout the show shes often forced to confront failure and the limits of her current karuta abilities i enjoyed the approach she took to improving herself looking to fix her flaws and adopting a welldeveloped style of play rather than just sharpening her talent speaking of chihaya i also really liked the characters in the show chihayas character is quite straightforward but is typically a joy to watch taichi is my favorite character and undergoes quite a bit of development throughout the series and well throughout the season as well arata is far less interesting but its nice to see chihayas and taichis influences on aratas life the interactions and drama between the three tend to be melodramatic in nature which isnt a bad thing if done correctly and are executed quite well especially in the first half of the series the other members of the misuzawa karuta club also shine at some point during the show in addition i liked that while the members were part of a team they still managed to retain their own individuality fairly well unlike other shows where as soon as someone joins a team they lose all distinctiveness whatsoever the production values are generally quite excellent the visuals are consistently beautiful and while i didnt favor any particular music selection in the show i thought that the sound in general did a good job of enhancing the atmosphere of the show ive been giving a lot of deserved praise to chihayafuru but what significantly decreased my overall enjoyment was the change in focus of the second half of the show from about the a nationals match onward the show becomes almost like a sports shounen the first half of the show was an excellent blend of life both inside and outside of the karuta club the second half of the show however s focused almost exclusively on karuta playing and left any potential dramadevelopment not directly related to karuta fall to the wayside much to my disappointment i still enjoyed the karuta games but i felt that the second half ultimately lacked the balance of parts that i felt made the first half so special in addition this change in focus and tone creates other flaws s chihayas character for instance becomes increasingly onedimensional as the only thing left on her mind is playing and winning karuta matches a second flaw is significant decrease in the quality of dramatic moments which now largely consists of crying after losing a match and can feel particularly forced at times overall i think that chihayafuru is a good show that utilizes its premise very well but is held back by a shift in focus that simplifies the nature of the show too much final score
anime,removed,rika furude
anime,removed,and then die by angelos hands next week
anime,removed,anyone got a guest pass me d
anime,removed,subscribe
anime,removed,i love emilia
anime,removed,should i post my links or are you grabbing them this time
anime,removed,i just finished gunbuster i always read that the first three episodes are rather boring but i think only the first episode was a bit hard to get through the setting and the themes of the show were interesting i had some s interstellar the nolan movie one of my favorites flashbacks from all this time dilation the theory that s the alien species are antibodies to cleanse the universe from germs was great aswell made me think about if we could really soil the universe if our technology progresses even further animations and design were nice aswell i really loved those warp sequences in my opinion the characters were the weakest point of the show i didnt really care for any of them except for noriko and the coach noriko had nice developement and the thing i liked about the coach is that he seperated his emotions from his job plus i might have a little norio wakamoto bias jung was extremely forgettable and kazumi was okay still i really enjoyed the show and im glad i finally watched it is diebuster worth watching aswell
anime,removed,this episode will end with a huge cliffhanger mark my words
anime,removed,alright give me a bit i edited my last comment to add links and it shows up as delete when i look at it while not logged in so something screwy happened
anime,removed,the real gem of the episode s ibusaki the closet perv
anime,removed,i hate the fact that i once deleted to make room for anime porn
anime,removed,im mad cuz my friend is leaving imma fuck the princess and screw things over for all my friends then when they come to save me ill just kill all of them and imma rape my friends wife and turn her into potato because im jealous and mad tldr fuck griffith
anime,removed,adorable figure i like the detail of the key but still wont change shitty ending
anime,removed,correction rem killed him once and next time tortured him ram killed him the second time
anime,removed,aside from that being wrong by this dumb logic julius cant do anything without his spirits because he fights with several you dont get point spirit users are supposed fight together not separately nor with only one of them barring of combat this whole point of partnership in the first place
anime,removed,fuck hayama manga
anime,removed,then he better stay true and central to himself
anime,removed,slaine he betrays his princess became pro war for the martians and he isnt even one of them like none of the martians except the princess were ever genuinely nice to him but for some fucking reason he cares about them so much to the point where he would eradicate his own people for them
anime,removed,i mean there are some monet and vergo died in the new world which is better than the previous half
anime,removed,want a spoiler free review
anime,removed,kirito has social anxiety and slightly autistic thats why all the aspies like him and socially awkward weebs do

anime,removed,did nobody freak out when young azami showed up in leonoras foodgasm
anime,removed,is over a week away obviously thats the best place for this discussion but its terribly restricting to not be able to discuss meta issues for up to a month max when theyre obviously the most relevant right now also this thread is still free talk so i dont see whats stopping me or others from starting a discussion here while these issues are still fresh unless people just dont want to see it of course
anime,removed,ftf is for free talk so i think it can be the place for this discussion if people want it meta thread doesnt go up for a week which is a frustrating length of time to wait in total silence on the issue theres a good opportunity to have a rational purposeful discussion now so why not take it if people just dont want to see this discussion right now though i totally understand

anime,removed,btw they are not the villains they are just the opposing army hell they even have better reasons to win the war than the protagonists side
anime,removed,as you see the ends all have personalities that are the opposite of what they where said to be in life so saying the black king is jesus isnt so far off especially once you find out his power later on

anime,removed,s to the point where he can hack a computer by pretty much reprogramming or rewriting an extremely complicated ai program yui in just a couple of secondsor completely ignoring the game mechanics for him and his wife by dying and still being alive in a game thats supposed to automatically kill you for real kill like shortcircuit your irl brain and then magically coming back to life to beat the bad guy thats less being a good player and more being god also doesnt help that even if hes an amazing player hes able to become the best and ohh just magically get one of the best traits in the game just cause you know mc and by going solo in a game meant to reward team efforts be stronger than the strongest player
anime,removed,now thats what i call shit taste
anime,removed,ive only seen the funimation shin chan dub where can i see this vitello dub torrents
anime,removed,this fan art isnt by a japanese person for a japanese audience banned
anime,removed,excellent episode as usual with this show brace yourselves next one is gonna feature one of the best moments in the manga should be fantastic
anime,removed,s they have more and more dogs show up for unexplained reasons as mc repeats timelines more and finally solve the mystery through the use of said dogs which are time paradogs instead of time paradox
anime,removed,calls people weebs lurks ranime
anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,we have the kira x shinobu otp ship sailing today tho
anime,removed,thats exactly the reason most of the ends were good guys that went insane due to betrayal and brutal torture right before they were brought to the new world
anime,removed,corey in the house
anime,removed,im not sure what your point is minutes is minutes no matter what website you use to watch things
anime,removed,careful youll trigger the emilia autismos
anime,removed,i mean dont invite him or youll kill his mother is a bit ominous isnt it
anime,removed,manga hot lol
anime,removed,how ironic that you claim that the authorstudio is trying hard to make rem the best waifu when they are so clearly doing exactly what you say but for emilia instead since even though she kinda has a very lack of character development despite being the main heroine and threw her popularity away after that subaru meltdown fiasco and yet they are still trying hard to make her still relevant and according to a commentor on a stream site spoiler alert they gonna soon make rem disappear and give emilia more screentime and love
anime,removed,i can confidently say that i dont understand why fine il take the downvotes and explain why because adding pain and suffering for the simply sake of adding pain and suffering does not equal good writing heres the thing this would be good if it either a ends that way with a moral statement b countinues for a short amount then ends with a moral statement c countinues and the mc overcomes it afaik it sounds like none of these things happen and it just turns into torture porn from here on out i fail to see how that would be any different from fanservice instead of mindless titty flashes its mindless suffering and gore
anime,removed,emilia isnt the witch because s subaru tells emilia about return by death through the pain that he experiences once and the witch of envy just kills her
anime,removed,scarred by shigatsu wa kimi no uso
anime,removed,those three sure had fun in the snow in todays episode
anime,removed,after todays episode i expected rezero spoilers in link httpimgurcomgeinxbbjpg
anime,removed,are we all shitposting re zero stuff gimme a second
anime,removed,there isnt one catch all set of rules for something as ambiguous as love and even if there was theres always an exception to every rule never in the history of human kind has anybody ever loved someone else without knowing why nobody says dunno i just love her people literally say that shit word for word all the time yeah a lot of the time it doesnt work out sometimes it does though also lay off the anime and maybe go get checked for autism or chuck back a few more antidepressants you havent got it all figured out
anime,removed,too soon
anime,removed,daddy wheres mommy
anime,removed,no he is getting broken by seeing people he knew for a week die guts had his best friend kill all their friends and rape his lover who they knew for years yes its maybe too much for a kid but getting progresively worse doesnt seem realistic to me specialy since there is still hope i can understand the breakdown if they were dead for good and it was completely irreversible but since it isnt there is little to be in despair about
anime,removed,this comment has been removed untagged or improperly tagged spoilers are not allowed repeated violations of this rule will result in a ban have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,removed,ye ok buddy you got it all figured out my bad you probably go ahead and get checked for autism though just in case
anime,removed,nanaki prepare to shocked p
anime,removed,a whole lot of shit gets shaken up believe me and on the off chance youre feeling frustrated by subarus excessive weakness hang in there by the time arc rolls out he is on a completely different level complete fodder sure but thats power creep i guess you get stronger the bosses get stronger
anime,removed,clannad after story another world tomoyokyou oh god help me this was hard on both the feels and the rating i seriously had a hard time deciding what score i should give this one the reveals involving s nagisa and ushios deaths were spoiled to me a long time ago so the impact was neutralized but the s fact that the little girl and the robot was ushio and tomoya after the reset with ushio becoming the lights of happiness and her last words of papa really hit hard a rundown on clannads strengths and weaknesses would be can subjectively be good or bad pro con sweet romance characters arent irritating and romance doesnt appear forced beautiful background art plot twists were decent hnnng decent characterization music gainax level ending somewhat generic plot and situations can be slow at times i ended up giving clannad an and after story a since i score based on how attached i get to a show not by its flawlessness otherwise all my would be right now i think clannad as deserved it clannad felt like a daughter she would be annoying as hell at times and teaching her things would be slow irritating and painful under normal circumstances but you cant help but love her musaigen no phantom world mm this is a weird one musaigens not bad but its stupid its stupid it knows that yet it tries to make you have fun and stop you from becoming as stupid as itself by tempting you to go on a quest for more useful knowledge with haruhikos random trivia it has genuine moments where its good ex s the family phantoms and reina mai being haruhikos temporary mom the humour on the first episode the story with haruhikos mom on the last two episodes and then there are times when you question what the hell were the scriptwriters thinking ex s mai transferring knowledge to haruhi onsen episode the episode where ruru becomes a human it felt more like a sitcom think kono biju which is airing this season gekkan shoujo nozakikun nisekoi ive heard the following novels become thematically more disturbing in nature but with the way musaigen ended up in sales im sad it doesnt have a chance to redeem itself it kind of grew on me overall its a strong or a weak its not as bad as people say it is its just that the harem setting on it is overused and it can be cringy at times rather than humorous toaru kaguku no railgun majutsu no index railgun index mmm episode is what id like to discuss here s i find that toumas memory loss which by the way is an extremely effective form of irony for index who was supposed to lose memories herself an interesting and painful topic not because of how good it is in writing or what symbolical stuff it implies but because of the impact it had on me after watching index side by side with railgun there are two major concerns that id like to point out for toumas case first his past with his memories on with a complete memory erasure due to somehow recovering after his brain cells were damaged it erases possibilities of characterization for the original touma involving his past before academy city the lack of this information kind of depresses me since it creates a hole in my perception of his character how did he get this kind of strong moral conviction that wont be addressed anytime soon unless his parents pop up in academy city or somethingwhich is unlikely the second concern is his relationship with birbiri and this is what gave me a slap on the face he wont remember anything about misaka mikoto their fights him seeing her playing around the beach their weird relationship the next time misaka will see him touma will probably say some thing who are you and that would be no different from a punch in the gut both to me and misaka that relationship gone like the wind that was what pained me most had i watched index normally i wouldve probably found it generic and the loss of memory of misaka wouldve been ike a passing breeze but i saw his characterization in railgun his relationship with birbiri growing with their fights the weird shenanigans that happened s and all of it gone like the wind
anime,removed,it felt so heavy splosh sleep like my daughter audience stare at the desolation caused by mcs poor choices and behavior while the world descends into an ice age to the tune of epic music
anime,removed,s soo whichever way we look at it theres going to be rem fighting and from what i guess the first time subaru was late because he slept in and rem left him the second time they would have been on time had subaru no gotten captured maybe just maybe theyll actually get there on time this time also considering the fighting maybe more swordmanship lessons for subaru like in the first go around and then some actual use of a sword in anger and i mean rage not doing something in anger like they say in somerset uk
anime,removed,actually hachikujis actual age at the time of the anime is and arararararagi didnt have any problems with that
anime,removed,i would correct you on part of your statement but it would be a spoiler
anime,removed,its nsfw anyway since subarus head got lopped off
anime,removed,exactly how can you not feel sad when they reveal the cutest girl has aids like wtf thats such a twist
anime,removed,embarrased you call the face of utter shock and concern that she showed when julius dealt the final strike to subaru as something so insignificant you know what im not even going to bother anymore you bandwagoners can suck it
anime,removed,hold the phone emilias more than a hundred years old
anime,removed,
anime,removed,berserk x bocu no pico
anime,removed,sure after a few minutes of him being on screen lol oh wait youre actually serious since he killed your waifu great villain confirmed
anime,removed,hola amigos de youtube estamos con un nuevo video de las curiosidades de dragon ball super capitulo sentimientos mas alla del tiempo trunks y mai
anime,removed,it also sets up the half where mob decided to join the club i remember the peeping tom saying mob is just like him and will not be popular
anime,removed,she definitely has a crush on him make no mistake about it s however its entirely onesided on her part this is really just a sweet tender slice of life about bonding through food primarily between tsumugi her dad kotori gets a bit closer to her folks as well down the road
anime,removed,so you figure out a way to write a letter to yourself ten years in the past and dont start off with yo dont invite this guy to hang out after class his mum will kill herself and then hell die seems legit
anime,removed,theory s maybe the yukizome that died in this episode isnt the real yukizome and she actually died in the zetsubou act just my speculation oh i cant forget about the red blood gross
anime,removed,
anime,removed,his spirit is transported to a parallel history only his memories are there not his physical ability
anime,removed,two episodes in and no new characters yet i am anxious to see how their dynamic changes once others join in
anime,removed,s her friend basically calls her out on that form of thinking kotori is such a good character i wouldnt mind her ending up as senseis second wifeafter she does some college of course how old is he anyways
anime,removed,made no sense to me either till close to the end where we learn that izzys military code name is rabbit which presumably accounts for that lagomorph in the basement bluesy fruesy actually sounds like a classic name for a pet rabbit though admittedly one of the girls stuffed doll variety
anime,removed,spoiler this post has been edited i was told my guess was spot one so i add a spoiler warning but hope you enjoy i was talking with a friend about rem and what we thought would happen to her i think that thay will not kill her off but do something to her like put her in a coma than we stared talking about some stuff i have been working on and was going over the plot and i was point out thay may make it so he only remember her than trys to kill him self but his save point might change and we did so more thlking i think this is what i think will happen all so its imposble for mc to stop the cult by him salf so he will need help so the kights will help and also can some one tale me the pricess candidate the green haired one that the mc is stating with in the op she is warring armor and fighting so i think she will fight the whale and maybe the whale has some kind of ability to make people not exist and thats what happen becomes i would think thay would kill off some the kights or maybe another one of the sin dudes can do that thats what happen if you guys have any thoughts on my theory please say so i hope this what happen it would a good anime if so this anime is already one of my favorite
anime,removed,this anime is just a wild ride i really like the fact that their whole escapade turned into a big thing at first they just went a little out of bounds and now were in a live or die situation involving queerats blowdogs and no powers im especially glad their actions had very real consequence and they werent really protected by plot armor at that point im not sure how i feel about things i cant stand the fact that theyre supposed to be like years old everything they do defies that im trying to look past that though because they seem like fine characters other than that only mamoru the pussy kind of makes sense p at first they threw a bunch of questions at us the whole situation at the school with the kids disappearing about saki having a sibling the weird declaration that maria will do something horrible in the future i like the story thats happening right now but this show has a weird way of introducing stuff like theyre trying to make you forget all that until they get back to it xx s i remember they get back to the village at some point so i guess were gonna get those answers but if i hadnt watched a bit before i may think they dropped all that
anime,removed,yeah lets hope it does not pull a usagi drop
anime,removed,better advice would be to just go torrent it off kickass free and fully functional master race piracy
anime,removed,this comment has been removed due to a recent rule revision all spoilers must include the title of the source being spoiled in the description of the spoiler tag please note that we no longer support the use of those red spoiler tags anymore so ignore that please edit your comment as such and reply to this and it will be reapproved you have not received an infraction have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,removed,anyone who doesnt want to be spoiled of what is going to happen or anything to godont watch the opening ffs this is probably the single worst offender ive ever seen as far as an opening showing everything that is going to happen in a seriesby quite a bit even spoils some pretty big twists i seriously dont understand what theyre doing with this adaptation theyve now covered the first chapters of the manga in episodes one chapter per episode granted the first was pages and the second was some they also actually changed some stuff around in this chapter for no reason at all that might have actually taken up more time the whole roof discussion at school never happened and was just part of the same conversation in the bedroom this messed up the flow of things and made it so they had to have the note be for the next day rather than that afternoonevening totally random to change all of that and need an extra scene for no reason a few other things were minorly changed as well which seems incredibly odd considering how very consistent the first chapter to episode was done do we know how many episodes this show is getting because currently i dont have any idea how theyre going to adapt everything they seem to plan to adapt were episodes in with chapters coveredgoing by the opening they look to cover the entire first chapters if anyone actually knows japanese can you translate what theyre saying when they keep calling the void maker a triggerless tattoo im pretty sure its a mistranslation and theyre actually meaning to say limitless but they keep saying it and it makes zero sense i know theyre saying mugen as part of it which i believe is infinite but im not sure if its also how you modify a word to with the less part or not his tattoo is special compared to most normal ones but triggerless is absolutely the wrong term was really interesting that we actually saw the inside of izzys locket in this episode as that doesnt normally happen for chapters not that its horribly significant right now id like to mentionremind people that his show airs at like in japan and is rated that said they look like theyre toning it down somewhat which im not surprised with at all going to make a separate post concerning actual spoilers discussion
anime,removed,much younger iirc theres a throwaway line somewhere in the manga about her being in this state for years so given that shes roughly the same apparent age as seigi puts her anywhere from to years of age
anime,removed,not really a big fan of the anime but later in the light novels of the series my favorite character kirika ueno gets much more character development id also like to see httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaccel world get a sequel as well there are a lot of more contentmaterial for the anime to get from the novels and the main character never reached level
anime,removed,crunchyroll subs didnt specify that the rock was heavy so i like to believe that jonathan just really cared about being able to lift that specific rock
anime,removed,the manga gets even darker with actual permadeath and dismemberment of many characters throwaways and not
anime,removed,the only things that could be interpreted as cheating are all the lolicon and incest stuff which are the one and only thing i fucking hate about monogatari but theyre clearly meant to be meaningless humor so i dont think its unreasonable to just ignore it when trying to seriously analyze character relationships youre already heavily cherry picking scenes to justify their relationship youre going to need to provide me a sufficient amount of evidence to prove that the heavily sexual interaction between koyomi and his sisters are meaningless humor in fact the sexual interactionstension that take place between koyomi and his sisters are almost always the method of conducting the energy within the scene it shouldnt be disregarded when seriously analyzing character relationships its a focal part of their relationship that absolutely needs to be addressed when analyzing the characters and im not sure why youd disregard hachikuji and koyomis kiss that was one of the most intimate moments in the entire series i encourage you to rewatch tsubasa cat and see how she interacts with hanekawa she is perfectly comfortable with araragi being friends with other girls because she knows that he loves her and trusts him to be faithful i would encourage you to rewatch episode of nisemonogatari where senjougahara literally tells koyomi that shes going to control every aspect of his life while that isnt meant to be taken too literally its certainly representative of her own personality she is perfectly comfortable with araragi being friends with other girls because she knows that he loves her and trusts him to be faithful her trust is misplaced then he has sexually interacted with almost every female in his harem and even straight up kissed two of them youre proving my point theres nothing unhealthy about it im glad it worked for you but there are times when koyomi genuinely questions whether senjougahara is saying these things from a position of affection in many instances she seems genuinely condescending shes already incredibly condescending as a person coupled with the fact that shes extremely possessive is not a good indicator for a good relationship
anime,removed,exactly i felt the same with your lie in april in the way kaori treated kousei like shit beating him for random shit that wasnt even his fault i really wanted to drop the show but i was already in too deep to do that
anime,removed,as someone whos halfway through rewatching after story no not at all sure shes kind of a huge pushover and has trouble making decisions for herself but thats part of her character arc her parents raised her with endless love and support which led her to become the incredibly gentle and polite girl she is but it also meant she was pretty sheltered she always had trouble talking to other people and ended up without any friends then tomoya came along and helped her to break out of her shell and meet people and find a place where she could be happy i will concede that in the first season of clannad shes little more than a person for tomoya to do nice things for but that all changes with after story in after story tomoya becomes and adult he has to find his own place to live find a job etc he struggles with money with working long hours with finding time to relax and do stuff he actually enjoys and what keeps him going its nagisa shes there to see him off every morning to welcome him in the evening and shes the only thing that makes it all worthwhile for him he honestly relies on her just as much as she relies on him and thats just really sweet to see her boundless patience understanding and selflessness makes her a perfect fit for him tldr nagisa only works because tomoya is such a great character
anime,removed,this is weird you guys are the reason people dont give anime a chance
anime,removed,how does activity draw people away do people not know who to collapse comment chains its a warm thread lol do people lose their balls when they go in or something
anime,removed,in the anime we havent seen enough of her like megumi which is why she doesnt have a lot of fans in the anime community she does get character development in the manga and is a favorite this is why im confused while i havent read too much of the manga yet all weve seen of erina in the anime is pure bitchiness just the fact that she just blatantly lied in order to prevent someone from getting into an academic facility just because she couldnt accept that she liked their cooking pissed me the fuck off so far all she has going for her is a stack design and great voice amongst a cast of incredibly design female characters and goddamn alice erina is easily worst girl of that show so far as i can tell
anime,removed,whos the blue haired on in the image

anime,removed,araragi from the monogatari series is a great example his default option is allowing himself to be killed even though hes immortal and nobody literally nobody in the series even those hes technically saved appreciates when he does this its a touching gesture but its the worst option and him needing to help others who should help themselves is araragis major character flaw and his series long character arc revolves around him coming to terms with it

anime,removed,the last scene the lights in the sky are stars brought tears to my eyes
anime,removed,he gets dismissed as just being cringy and stupid he is cringy and stupid but thats part of what makes him so interesting subaru fancies himself as a typical selfinsert mc but he fails to realize that reality doesnt work like an rpg and he pays for his mistake his flawed worldview combined with his repeated deaths are a perfect recipe for the dangerously unstable individual weve seen in the past few episodes
anime,removed,the nice boat meme isnt entirely in the show rather a sudden mishaps where the last episode was delayed due to a murder case and was replaced some nice scenery shots of various things including a nice looking boat
anime,removed,throughout eva it gradually became more psychological if you couldnt tell it was going to go that way when asuka went crazy and shinji started fighting angels that went after him emotionally im not sure what to say to you
anime,removed,i think people really didnt like it because they hate the idea of the main protagonist not having a happily ever after life after all of the amazing accomplishments that simon has done in his life he fades into obscurity leaving behind his crew i can understand who argue for it thematically appropriate but its one of those situations that can also be argued by just your gut feeling and reaction to the ending i can understand why people would be bitter about it
anime,removed,whos rem anyway
anime,removed,wtf is a rem
anime,removed,do we have to tag spoilers in a post that already has a spoiler tag isnt the point of the spoiler tag to warn redditors that there are spoilers in the thread
anime,removed,youre getting downvoted because youre drawing from pretty much the intro to the show its a long run and that was setup ill use game of thrones as an example for why i dont like current subaru its like tyrion shooting tywin without the context of how much of an asshole tywin is theres a logical reason for it but the emotional tone doesnt match and on the whole it feels wrong if you look hard enough hes got deep motivations but the writing is doing just about everything it can not to set the proper emotional tone and his actions just dont fit unless you go back look at story elements and go he probably feels like
anime,removed,rem missing something something whales kukuku
anime,removed,they knew each other only for a few months and already walk home together how shameless erina nakiri shokugeki no souma
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,i dont know why nobody has mentioned steinsgate yet the whole series is just a emotional rollercoaster especially swhen he finally succeeds to go back and screams how the operation was finally complete just the emotion and pain in his voice from everything hes gone through combined with his character personality of saying wacky ridiculous things but you alongside the other characters know that his scream wasnt just some wacky comment broke my heart and brought tears to my eyes been so depressed that ive rewatched the series at least times these past years
anime,removed,you better hope she doesnt dies she dies in the books

anime,removed,steinsgate spoilers this episode reminded my heavily of a very similar episode of steinsgate i believe it was ep where okabe was ready to give up believing his situation was impossible until mayuri convinced him otherwise rem is drawing a lot of parallels to mayuri and i think white fox is recreating some of the same magic from before this was definitely the turning point of the series subaru just got his second wind just like okabe got his after witnessing all the pain and suffering over and over
anime,removed,because its sad as fuck and only gets worse from here
anime,removed,gluttony not really its more like its controlled by the archbishop of gluttony
anime,removed,pretty much everything was this was probably the most important part so far in the series and leads to a complete change in subarus character so they didnt change any of it from the light novel

anime,removed,yes he can and s the only one who can kill him at that point is reinhard which he actually does
anime,removed,in the web novels there is a what if subaru and rem did run away right now sort of offshoot of sorts s they have two kids a boy and a girl and live an idyllic loving and generally uneventful lifestyle for the rest of their days
anime,removed,makes me wonder how that would happen at all if puck can destroy the world he doesnt reinhardt kills him
anime,removed,imagine if they give out blank pillows and when people complain they just respond with whos rem

anime,removed,okay are we really going to use spoilers tags for a movie made almost years ago like isnt there a statute of limitations here like what if i told you that angry men ends with the one juror convincing them to not convict
anime,removed,i think its really clear from the beginning that pretty much everyone is going to die i mean the first scene is seita dying isnt the journey more important than any one moment
anime,removed,the only sad death was l butler the rest wasnt any emotional as far as i remember
anime,removed,the first fma made me feel things i never experienced with brotherhood dont get me wrong i loved it and was hyped and all for everything going down but the original just had more of anemotional layer or something to the characters for example hughes death didnt really do shit for me in brotherhood while i cried like a little bitch in the original
anime,removed,rem fans wont follow the series anymore after they see ep of if it ever even happens
anime,removed,thats what i think too but it pisses me off when bunch of gays cry in every postepisode discussion when even too much cleavage is shown for example in ongoing show shuumatsu no izetta in every discussion theres either post about unnecesary fanservice or when there isnt any then they get salty with oh so they can make a good episode without unnecessary fanservice i somehow want to punch those guys in the face
anime,removed,yoko from gurren lagaan and its not because she inadvertently killed two characters with her cursed ass

anime,removed,arakawa under the bridge x bridge after putting it on hold for a while and came back to be pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it despite how ridiculous and how insane the characters may seem at times arakawa does a really good job of making everyone seem human probably the first anime comedy i legitimately liked kimikiss pure rouge i got into this show when it was recommended to me due to romance with a kuudere and i got what i came for although it wasnt the main character it was still really well developed one thing that caught me way off guard was the sudden tone shift mid series from something light like a slice of life to almost a melodrama i didnt personally mind it but it kinda came out of nowhere anyways for those of you who are fans of the childhood friend you should watch this because s she wins the love triangle unless you really like kuuderes like me this is probably a
anime,removed,the last episode of the berserk anime i would time stamp the episode on youtube but apparently i cant post it because illegal streaming even though clips are fine
anime,removed,specially edited for botchan senpai edition decided to binge a few onecours in between jojo seasons hibike euphonium all i knew about this series going in was kyoani and httpsgfycatcomonlyangryfossa and i wasnt disappointed the animation was gorgeous the music was great and the characters were really good too especially reina and kumiko i also went in assuming the yuribaiting was exaggerated but it was legitimately strong youd need goggles if you couldnt see it cant wait for season two s itll be funny if we get the fabled childhood friend engine and everyonell still be salty from not getting yuri oregairu this show lived up to the hype as well the animation and music were all pretty average but the characters are by far the biggest focus of this show and they certainly deliver though exaggerated they all felt relatable at times and their commentary on social situations seemed pretty insightful there was also a little tropey comedy but i didnt mind it that muchbecause totsuka best girl yuuki yuuna is a hero this was a fun cute sol good for a little breather in between heavier shows s ok i knew it was more of a cutegirlsdoingsufferingthings mahou shoujo going in and despite definite similarities to madoka and nge it mostly held its own the fight scenes were great and so was the music even if it sounded a little too similar to madokas soundtrack i thought the ending was ok the whole setting was so mysterious that even if it was sort of an asspull it didnt totally derail the show i also subscribe to the theory that yuunas still a hero kara no kyoukai this was a fantastic movie series that should definitely be talked about more the animation and fight scenes were incredible something something ufotables unlimited budget the music was outstanding and the plot and characters were great especially how they were developed as the series nonchronologically progressed to dispel some possible doubts you dont need to know anything about the nasuverse or fate and though its a series of movies most of them are only minutes to an hour long and are the only full length ones and believe me youll wish they were longer would fully recommend
anime,removed,the scene from fmab dub when that chick cuts her arm off so her and ling can get away from bradley then in the next scene the doctor operates on her and pulls her nerves out of her stump and she lets out this scream of pain the scream is extremely convincing and i always shudder when i hear it
anime,removed,sowhat made johan fucked up its all up for interpretation since its not confirmed whether johan went with the organisation or his sister did since he was posing as a twin daughter i think its same to assume he was crazy from the start why in the actual fuck did tenma save him again tenma felt morally obligated to save the boy after finding out that a former patient of his is now a serial killer personally the dedication felt very superficial and not convincing what happened to him in the end did he escape out the window finally commit the suicide by jumping out of it why the hell was he not under maximum security if his goal was to off himself why do so much unnecessary stuff like the burning of the books i think the open window implies suicide but none of this is confirmed and if i recall correctly he wasnt being formally arrested or anything when he finally met with tenma so he wasnt hospitalised under police care i kind of get your feeling about the show the stories were interesting but i found the show to be flat after i reached the middle it turned into a who dunnit and it that got old fairly fast the show does tend to insist upon itself and didnt make it up for the investment of watching episodes so much left unanswered in a way that cant really be theorised upon
anime,removed,ha nope not even close nice try though about deku punching that guy it was canceledadsorbed pretty much there secret weapon vs all might which you will see in the next episodes
anime,removed,shokoyo youre too god damn close but narrow the people down its not everyone just one specific

anime,removed,hmm why would he choose chitoge over onodera though hes liked onodera this whole time and just started liking chitoge i like chitoge how she is now in the second season last ep but anything before shes just annoying second to last ep fav onodera last ep fav chitoge rn i dnt think raku doesnt even deserve both he finally seems to be making up his mind though in the manga i dont read it but i did read the last chapter and i saw them as kids im confused bc on one panel raku said to onodera that he has always liked kosaki why would he say her name in third person when shes right there infront of him plus chitoge gives the book to onodera bc he said he likes her and she thinks they should both be together since they love each other
anime,removed,likely wont be answered in season either given the manga its a whiles away

anime,removed,season is just the shiratorizawa v karasuno set thats only games

anime,removed,viral from ttgl has always been up there for me
anime,removed,as a gundam fan i can only say char
anime,removed,vegeta is the only real answer
anime,removed,its a tie between viral lordgenome redeeming himself was cool too but viral was a tiny bit better imo since he showed some doubts on his beliefs since very early on his turning felt even more awesome and piccolo i always liked him in db and z but after seeing him care so much about baby pan in super episode i loved him even more that was fucking heartwarming man almost made me tear up fucking cute

anime,removed,i still blame griffith
anime,removed,i dont care what yall say lelouch is alive and well
anime,removed,for me personally it felt very awkward there were situations where i was simply confused as to who was where and when and why they were doing what they were doing for instance the whole s prison break sequence was very confusing to me i didnt really know why they had to go there and why s lava bender from legend of korra was fighting kaneki thats just one example and in addition to all this confusion i had a displeasure of watching it censored but hey it had a pretty cool soundtrack this is just my personal experience with a show
anime,removed,the top middle is kinda spoilery but not really idk you might wanna tag it anyway
anime,removed,considering they literally just used the super dragon balls on universe earth i doubt it we already know this is the same trunks from the android saga they just decided to use blue hair this time

anime,removed,tokoyami is so funny take the villains out bit by bit toko you could wipe em all out by yourself
anime,removed,i really dont consider ylia a tragedy and if you did you missed the point there was never any doubt that kaori was dying and that wasnt the point of the show the point was how her existence changed kousei for the better who in turn changed everyone around him for the better kousei learned to overcome his trauma and through his interaction with nagi learned a healthier teacherpupil relationship than he had with his mother tsunami learned to face her own feelings for kousei watari learned that relationships with women can be more meaningful emi and takeshi drew more inspiration to compete with kousei the point of ylia is to inspire not to make you cry

anime,removed,wasnt sakura wormly recieved in her new home in zero
anime,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

anime,removed,their child is strong because of the power heshe has s from someone else its a specific person i wont mention im sure it was mentioned in the early episodes s essentially it is the souls of previous exorcists or people in general that have died who protect the current person they are with giving them their spell power or whatever its called there is also a way to find out who those soulspeople are and see just how strong the person may be because of them especially when that person has more that one soul protecting them they dont have to be good guys either which i find really interesting
anime,removed,true but claire absolutely wrecked him with that monologue just the last line of it always gives me chills allow me to bring you into that new world of suffering until you lose your will to come back to life
anime,removed,i dont remember what happened to itachi besides him killing his family naruto himself had a rather sad backstory too
anime,removed,im not sure if they mentioned this in the anime but s a person named abe no seimei who apparently was the most powerful exorsist to have lived will be that person giving the miko hisher power
anime,removed,i cant find a good site with updated anime torrents after kickass was shut down can anyone point me in the right direction
anime,removed,guts born from corpse writhing in a pool of blood and afterbirth

anime,removed,he comes back later as a ghost
anime,removed,well theres also that part at the end of rs where like everyone dies for a minute that one was pretty harsh
anime,removed,archer s literally forced to suffer eternally
anime,removed,meanwhile uroko made a rather ominous statement we cant let the surface have the people of the sea right now i suppose thats going to continue to be where a lot of the drama comes from for the remainder of the series yeah he probably left out because im going to need to need them for food to prepare for my hybernation
anime,removed,who didnt see it happening bleach has been horrible for a long time i stopped caring about the quality of it when suddenly none of the super strong quincy were using bows and king quincy used a fucking sword
anime,removed,it got really fucking rushed at the end which came out today many questions went unanswered and then ichigo and orihimes son kazui randomly defeats yhwachs energy returning and meets ichika the daughter of renji and rukia yeah this ending could have been so much better
anime,removed,s i mean not really as far as my knowledge would say but you also could and it still would work
anime,removed,seras victorias s parents were murdered oh and she could only watch as one of the murderers fucked her moms corpse then she became an outcast in a private school and to top it all off she had to watch all her comrades being slaughtered after becoming a police officer

anime,removed,deductive
anime,removed,s grand so return by death seems more like reversing time then time travel judging from the anime displaying the episode in hazy reverse order in his third death stopping at the apple seller so i reasoned there was no actual time travel taking place rather return by death is turning time backwards for everyone if that is the case then it is unlikely subaru will travel back in time to become flugel since there is no method shown so far capable of doing so s yeah that was what i was spoiled on are there any more details about his parents given has what makes a person compatible been gone into without any serious spoilers if possible enjoying working through it all myself i was rewatching the anime recently and there are lots of small nods to subarus opinion on his family even from the episode for instance when reinhard is talking about how it can be hard to live up to his familys expectations subaru does a pause stare and changes the subject following on from that subarus desire for recognition for his effort plays into this relationship he has with his folks rewatching the series subaru really has low selfesteem and constantly is looking for other people to approve of him since he doesnt actually place any value on himself all in all a very well put together character
anime,removed,fair enough but we should keep in mind that s the time loops did break yuki emotionally enough for her to violate her programming and change the whole world if you rewatch some of the episodes of endless eight yuki httpimgurcomyrsnknj inside and her tone of voice sounds even more flat and bored than usual all this for a character that doesnt show emotion by nature is pretty significant
anime,removed,tonari no kaibutsu kun girl obsessed with studyingbeing the best at school falls for a delinquent who effortlessly gets good grades thought it would be great little did i know the anime ended before it even began and afaik there will never be more seasons so fuck that shit
anime,removed,ttgl and klk have no business being compared to these other pieces of fucking garbage

anime,removed,forbiddenlove
anime,removed,i kinda appreciate getting all the exposition and introductions out of the way immediately hopefully theres nothing to stop us from diving right into the action in the second episode my biggest concern is that the series is just gonna end up being edgy for the sake of being edgy or rather its just going to try to copy the magical girls but with death and despair thing that madoka had without realizing that there was a lot more to madoka that made it so great i guess well just have to wait and see if this series can show some originality and another thing was it some problem with my stream or did the whole thing have a really low framerate dont get me wrong in terms of characters and design and such i liked the animation but everything and everyone moved like they were in slowmotion or something and it kinda took me out of it
anime,removed,the only thing falling in that show is kaori
anime,removed,sadly the main ship wont sail again tgis season
anime,removed,
anime,removed,shut the fuck up anime
anime,removed,i was thinking this but i kind of just want to draw little pictures of kyubey and pon having snacks and discussing their killing of magical girls like a past time

anime,removed,shisui uchiha his suicide gave itachi the power to protect the village
anime,removed,probably ends at the conclusion of the bullying arc where it somewhat resolves the internal struggle of kiriyama and his shogi slumping but transfers the story onto the rest of the kawamoto family the op also has that iconic scene that marks the transition so its most likely will end at around chapter and hinting at possible adaptation of the rest once more chapters are out for a season honestly hope they dont go for anime original cause sangatsu has a breadth of stories to tell
anime,removed,i wonder what goes through the character designers minds when they decided on that its called not being a homosexual like half this sub seems to be
anime,removed,one piece luffy punching the celestial dragon back in his place was fucking glorious
anime,removed,i didnt think training with hinako was that bad if looking at jiggling boobs helps people get off the couch im all for it
anime,removed,he is so similar to kamina i have been expecting him to die for so long
anime,removed,you really nailed it cowboy bebop s cowboy bebop was one of the few anime that left me completely satisfied as it gave me all of the closure i needed i wasnt left wanting more or wondering what else was going to happen i was just satisfied that everything was resolved the theory that the mc survives annoys me as it takes a lot away from the ending and undoes some of that closure the cast living happily ever after rarely provides as much closure and they often feel slightly forced i guess it helped that it was a pretty much perfect ending anyway
anime,removed,girls und panzer film first of all did anyone else think miho looked like rena from higurashi every time she made an appearance which was a lot since she is the main character i was half expecting her to break into a psychotic laugh and kill a bunch of people besides this the show is very much cute girls doing cute girl things since the thought of boys in tanks is laughable i thought the tank matches and battles would be side stuff but they actually carried the show for me and i loved seeing them i give season a score the film is the same but better it does drag on the problem from season though the entire premise of season was that an underdog team would need to win to save their school and due to bullshit and technicality this is thrown out the window for the film so they must once again win against a big team to official save their schoolfor reals this time i swear the film is hours long the main school gets help from the previous schools they defeated in season and became friends with after a lot of familiar and awesome faces return which is cool my favorite girl being commander fish and chips with some tea i never really learned their names but who im talking about should be obvious next favorite is sleepy girl anyway most of the film is one big tank battle which if you wanted more of you will definitely enjoy the last thirty minutes are exhilarating and over the top in all the best ways the only real downside besides the overuse of the school is closing is the main antagonist doesnt get any real development she is simply a strong commander of a team who was asked to play against the main characters so i understand its simply a game to her and why we dont see much of her normal life but a little bit more would have been nice score sakurasou no pet na kanojo an anime where i hated most of the main cast as much as i loved them watching these dense characters make the most basic mistakes and hurt each other due to their own stupidity was brutal but when they got their act together sometimes it was touching ryuunosuke who i thought was a girl at first and rita were my favorite pair in the show my gosh the show needed more of them the show has elements of romance and comedy but it wasnt really the focus of the show for me the whole show tackled the themes of talent hard work effort jealousy and etc i really enjoyed watching the show but i still felt it was missing something for it to be a great show it wasnt mediocre but it wasnt amazing score ore no kanojo to osananajimi ga shuraba sugiru episodes in to be honest i started this anime by accident i was planning on watching ore no imōto ga konna ni kawaii wake ga nai but couldnt remember the exact name ended up watching this instead so far its pretty good but not really great my only hope is that the mc doesnt end up with the childhood friend loli i usually root for childhood friends and lolis but this one i just dont like
anime,removed,hm for end of evangelion i would have gone with shinji wanking over asukas unconscious body
anime,removed,prison school episodes in and well this is not a show you want people to know youve watched freakin hilarious though good god the things these guys go through s my favourite character so far is gakuto he is a true bro i am also a romance of the three kingdoms buff myself but i am more of a devious cao mengde supporter

anime,removed,anyone feels strange that the blue hair girl is completely missing from the kids
anime,removed,now onwards to arc in the next episode
anime,removed,hunter x hunter so heres my hunter x hunter update spoilers for up to episode so nen there are six types of nen styles if i can remember this right gon got enhancer which is like your straightforward kind of thing gon seems like a straightforward person so no wonder hes got the simple power killua is a transmuter which is surprising i thought that since hes the edgy sidekick hed be a specialist or something kurapika is the first one of the main group to get his nen power which is some chains on his arms im pretty sure theres some special power in there because otherwise as his instructor pointed out why wouldnt he just buy some chains and leorio is off shelving fucking books or something too bad so gon vs hisoka hisoka is so fucking cool gon earned that punch on him and hisoka is a member of the phantom troupe like i predicted but hes also a turncoat who wants to kill them all which i did not predict id bet you anything that illumi is a member of the troupe i wonder what his nen power is maybe its hypnosis or more likely its something to do with his pins anyway i didnt like the heavens arena arc that much but now were on our way its a little strange seeing how technologically advanced this series is compared to other shonen stuff i guess its strange seeing magic and technology next to each other weve got hightech computers a fullydeveloped internet and multiple generations of video game consoles the hunter x hunter world doesnt seem like a bad place to live really anyway piggysan is really living the dream sitting in his room full of figurines eating snacks reverseengineering videogames i bet when we inevitably see him fight hes going to be some kind of crazy acrobat i know that he fights with bombs he did mention something like that in the killuas family miniarc but i mean hes a zoldyck i bet he has nen anyway kurapika the next dozen episodes are going to be kurapika central i can feel it hes even got a new group to roll with big hair rough trade and moleman lady okay so theyve all got to find something and one of those things includes those kunta kinte clan eyes that kurapika has so one of that group is probably going to figure it out and try to kill kurapika melody is interesting shes got a nice voice but she looks like the dungeon master from the dd cartoon im going to guess that shes an enhancer who enhances her ears to listen to heartbeats that or shes a specialist hey what if leorio is a specialist that would be badass what if isaac netero is a specialist i know that mr netero is going to come back later because i see him used around here more than a minor side character would ever be used so i want to see whats up with the old man or maybe we never see a specialist in the series who knows either way im going to assume that everybody is a specialist basically pretty good so far cant wait to see whats going on in yorknew still reusing a lot of the soundtrack but theyre adding in some new tunes
anime,removed,its just one of the little details that helps keep this more realistic most anime would let the protagonist get away with one handed pullups on a sword stuck in a wall but theyre like ayyyy how bout physics
anime,removed,s yeah there are bits of romance but theyre mostly a wild mix of tragic and bittersweetheartwarming

anime,removed,funimations dubbed it so you can watch it there for like £ a month or google fairy tail dub torrent
anime,removed,one of those gray areas milias legendary status in sdfm depends largely upon her having been around for some time and its implied that macronized zentradi have long lifespans however that supposedly went away if they micronized themselves as she did so she could have been a years old in earth years but reverted back to an human level when she went to live with max and then aged normally for a human

anime,removed,young blonde green eyed boy works in grandfathers cafe
anime,removed,im not sure why but im starting to get pretty tired of this show the story itself has a lot of potential imo but the pacing and storytelling itself is very lacking s hiiro having some sort of superpower was kind of obvious ever since we learned that he sucks with a sword yet they took sooo long to tell the viewer about this were episodes in and theyve almost reached their destination yet the mc hasnt shown any progress in regards to fighting prowess it seems hell just use his overpowered magic to solve the conflict in the end which would be something that i expected not to happen in this series hopefully the next episode will get more interesting
anime,removed,it doesnt make sense why producer shows us something which should be shown in first episodes s hiiros true power and why the fk this old magician didnt say him about s his power this anime has big potential but action is moving so slowly and its bad me

anime,removed,they got married combo
anime,removed,some characters would kinda go out of character by fighting especially hanekawa and nadeko i find it hilarious that when pointing out characters not suited to fighting you point out the two characters who s come closest to actually killing araragi aside from maybe kanbaru and kagenui the only character i couldnt see in a fighting game would be hachikuji although s her alternate timeline grown up version looked like she could certainly put up a fight

anime,removed,emiya shirou from fatestay night shapes his entire existence around his ideal of being a superhero passed down to him by his father emiya kiritsugu who also deserves a mention hes a manchild that followed his ideal to the end and was ultimately broken by it as a kid he almost died from a fire that killed everyone he knew and was saved by the aforementioned father as a result of being the only one saved hes an empty shell — hes almost entirely emotionless and his only way of happiness is the happiness of others hes broken from the start — he finds zero value in his own self the only reason he doesnt want to die is because he cant save people while dead he strives to help people at any cost and save everyone — he doesnt want to save as many as possible he wants to save them all no matter what he needs to pay the best part about him however is how the story of fsn plays with his ideals through the three routes you see him and his ideals change in various ways all versions of shirou are very different people stemming from the same base living his ideal to the end deciding to follow it while acknowledging its flaws or leaving it altogether — hes a very interesting character with immense depth and my favorite character of all time
anime,removed,if youre too stupid to understand or enjoy the story then dont force yourself not everyone can appreciate good writing
anime,removed,she got eaten during the last episode not shown in the anime and as arc is already as long as the first combined it will be at least season or before we see rem again

anime,removed,nobody mentions him because he overcomes his own foolish ideology over the series as snake said there are no heroes or heroines if you lose youre worm food while talking about war while the context is different it does apply in katsuragis case he sees every person by the value and traits that visibly define them as what the person is in itself when its actually deeper than that although i think the series failed to show it a girl isnt just what she makes herself look like in public best anime example is yuigahama yui from oregairu she s covers her personality by saying what other people wants her to say in order to remain somewhat popular and in the group all the girls in the show are shallow except for chichiro whose blandness actually gave her a personality to shine upon and arguably tenri whose story is not developed enough in the series for me to get a serious opinion on her the librarian girl is what she is the perfect shy girl whose only flaw was compensated by katsuragis help kanons flawless she just didnt realize she was noticed ayumi had no flaws she just wasnt confident in her own skills mio had only flaw and that was pride she then lost it thanks to katsuragi see the pattern all those girls have no depth in their personalities only one single gap inside and i know that was the plot of the story but thats utterly stupid every person has a sin a flaw and that makes us human but having sin that can be easily compensated by falling in love with someone or by having someone say a few sentences to you is just being naïve this is why the plot itself is kind of flawed but also why his ideology itself is flawed the character development was showing how katsuragi eventually came to accept that real life girls are indeed interesting persons that can be conquered regardless of whatever pattern they had in their personality especially since chihiro is devoid of any actual pattern and is probably the most realistic depiction of a normal person without any serious hobby also he doesnt truly believe that he can do anything with information thats the facade he keeps in order to keep being able to conquer girls and save his life in the same time he constantly has to act like someone who can do pretty much anything when hes actually quite powerless it was truly shown during the megamihen he felt at loss at what to do but he had to continue because if he fails death will be the only result so yeah he doesnt really believe in his own ideology himself you cant really claim it to be interesting when the character himself thinks its stupid deep down
anime,removed,i just watched masamunekuns revenge anime and from what i see it has similar concept the guy wants the girl to love him and dump him and spoiler alert they like each other but from what i see i really liked last game ending really suggest to read this do note tho last game manga female mc is sometimes can be really annoying and dense till that you might hate her
anime,removed,there is crunchyroll if you use chrome you can download the crunchyroll unblocker extension and boom at least this is what i did and boy did it help
anime,removed,after seeing him promise a mother not to kill her child only to turn her into a zombie and have her kill her child herself i dont think theres any levels he would not stoop an utter bastard though an utterly classy and fabulous bastard
anime,removed,the scene in which he restores yuis ai made me want to gouge my eyes out with a spoon and fill the hole with bleach
anime,removed,would kill a white whale for her
anime,removed,the cutest master swordsman has and so begins her conquest of all other best girls
anime,removed,he was a lucky man
anime,removed,i dont know about you but my best girl is in fact not dead
anime,removed,even if it is bad it still did something no other anime has done let people be people mc gets the chance to nail a bunch of chicks and guess what he becomes addicted to sex we will always have another harem where the mc never chooses or has a clue on which girl to pick this one went the other way and in a big way of course in typical japanese fashion if you go evil you will be killed off in the end happens every time in japanese dramas
anime,removed,you know hes waiting in that belly for the opportune moment to strike
anime,removed,thunderbolt fantasy superb not animated but very very good
anime,removed,prison school season i know its probably coming anyway but id definitely do some major tweaks to the pacing and parts of the plot s meikos personality change was a nice change of pace but it dragged on for way too long and only got in the way of the plot and enjoyability id wrap up that arc much quicker possibly even before the calvary arc the prison arc ii was very well done and paced id pretty much keep the rest of that in just a bit more time on some side characters eg give cakesan and wolf girl just a little bit more screen time before having her suddenly pop up in itd make their joining just a bit less random also a bit more delving into mitsuko she just kinda drops off until the plot needs a gag to move the story along since im doing this pacing ideas for half of a twocour probably set after mari gets out of prison for the games chairmans bizarre adventures awesome but the way it cuts into the calvary arc just makes both of them drag on unless there is some insane parallel that requires this style of telling its probably be easier to backload that entire side story to just before whatever reveal they are going for the current calvalry arc oh god so many awesome things that happened but so much padding between them id say cut the battle in half or more frontload the side confrontations to before the battle basically everything not involving kiyoshi mari and maybe whatever hana has coming even meikos plot can be at least setup before the battle that way the battle keeps the intensity while establishing the character relations doing it in the middle just removes urgency
anime,removed,but shes dead
anime,removed,i feel just mildly sad that she doesnt seem to be a major character being you know years gone and all
anime,removed,cool reminds me of radio but seems to work a bit better on my phone from the little ive used the site so far
anime,removed,i dont know about you guys but im pretty sure misa misa is the reason kira didnt win in death note and yeah i hate her sooooooooo much
anime,removed,hey thanks for commenting ive set up a section on the just for this if you feel like you have some spare time and want to link me the songs in hq in there it would be amazing
anime,removed,theres also eden radio edenofthewestcom
anime,removed,radio is better
anime,removed,actually its the s girl in the middle with the red eyes the boy in the foreground is actually a minor character
anime,removed,listen it ends up being a matter of opinion but in s the people who died because of his inadequacies couldnt even be brought back to life because the item that did that only works in a second period to me that was very memorable
anime,removed,ill never recover from them killing
anime,removed,wait but s doesnt he refer to theresia as his wife
anime,removed,im sure you could find the trailer on a certain torrent site
anime,removed,but wilhelm actually does
anime,removed,i guess it would be fine but not the message that the creators wanted to communicate talking about death note i hated misa for so long its not a bad character dam i love her character design but her depiction is so detrimental to the story s works because she had the shinigami eyes but after that is a low minion and as a female character is treated as shit with the only purpose to serve to light on top of that is annoying as hell i think that is offensive as fuck and she could be a better character if she was treated with more respect by the authors
anime,removed,spoiler
anime,removed,id remove the childhood friend from shuffle so that s we might actually have a good ending and best girl would probably win too
anime,removed,good luck with that not even spoiler succeeded
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i guess what really threw me off the most is that the main character peace be upon him isnt even pictured
anime,removed,its supposed be hidden in her panties so she can use it in the fight later in the garden i guess they just forgot that continuity

anime,removed,aside from the time skip in ttgl the story in both of these series progress very similarly when i watched kill la kill for the first time i couldnt help but feel like i was watching ttgl and vice versa when i rewatched ttgl particularly the climax of both shows evoked the same feelings within me
anime,removed,im going by omnibus releases buying the books i know i could go on certain website to read and finish but i personally like reading when traveling and its something i feel fine supporting so that puts me on ch end of omnibus i do have omnibus that will put me on but havent read since im reading others at the moment
anime,removed,wrong subreddit but i use manga rock
anime,removed,i suggest mangania it might not be very practical but it is by far the most reliable app i could find ive been using it for about years now and it has yet to fail me if you the kind of guy who needs to get notified when a new chapter comes out then sorry but its lacking that feature other than that its fine
anime,removed,it made my emotional state even worse considering i decided to bingewatch it
anime,removed,screen time flashback only fraction of single episode living status false bgw best girl war position winner
anime,removed,havent read the source but i think its berserk and im going to go off on a limb here and guess that s she gets raped by the horse cuz berserk
anime,removed,plastic memories was poorly written i was pissed past episode when they reveal the youknowwhat thing
anime,removed,soul eater not i got very angry at this piece of shit not only because it was bad but because it disgrace the original serie in soul eater maka and soul went through a hell of madness to finally being able to slay a witch
anime,removed,manga storm works really nice for me the full version is about or cant remember but it allows you to download an unlimited number of chapters offline when the nonpremium limits you to otherwise runs really smoothly and cleanly
anime,removed,best girl chisaki miuna fight me if you think otherwise ftfy
anime,removed,manga bird
anime,removed,s then nia dies
anime,removed,probably nisekoi when the valentines day episode came out almost every minute there was some stupid cliche and finally realized that the show is just a waste of time since its never gonna go anywhere also in code geass s when nunnaly dies it finally felt like lelouch would have someone to talk with and finally have some help but that sht happened felt the same when s euphemia got geassd and it felt so cheap too
anime,removed,beepbeep im a bot your comment seems sad to us cheer up have a ps this bot is powered by ai httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcejlvmnrty
anime,removed,dat moment when subaru rejected rem yooprobably the angriest ive been at an anime ever xd
anime,removed,for not killing kirito in episode there was a lot about the anime that i didnt like and then all of a sudden out of the blue they had this really nice moment where the world was destroyed and kirito and asuna just held each other or something then the screen faded to white and i immediately started repeating in my mind please let him die please let him die you somehow found a good point to end on where kirito is a hero just let him die nope
anime,removed,depends on the spoiler and what it spoils something minor like azusas role is no problem spoiling something major like when mugi accidentally stabs ritsu then its pretty annoying because all of the tension is gone and you are pretty much waiting for it to happen
anime,removed,i heard the movie is awesome too httpsmymixtapemoexlvahkwebm
anime,removed,l dieees
anime,removed,obligatory
anime,removed,how do yall rewatch this knowing nothing ever really develops between hyouker and chintanderino
anime,removed,satoshi and mayaka from hyouka i find them more interesting than oreki and chitanda and since they are s dating i want a romance about satoshi and mayaka and one of the conflicts could be satoshi feeling obsessed with mayaka again and tries to stop being obsessed by breaking up with her it could be a great drama romance
anime,removed,its gainax the end also panty and stocking die and are reincarnated as s ryuko and satsuki
anime,removed,currently on akame ga kill id recommend it
anime,removed,leafawhatsherface its not very well written and its just weird anyway
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i think eureka seven sure could use a sequel it would take place after renton and eurekas return and well see all of the old cast again especially dominic and anemone i mean it sure would be stupid not to give most of the preexisting cast any screentime that would just be dumb it could make revolve around coexisting with the coralians building upon the themes and ideals set in the prequel of course in no way destroying the narrative of its predecessor also it would be great if the story focused on the now adult cast instead of a bunch of teenagers or something silly like that maybe have renton and eureka build a happy family or something and not name their kid anything stupid like ao
anime,removed,actually more than eight are going to die
anime,removed,guys when is ash gonna become hokage
anime,removed,
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i saw a rem cosplayer in the last anime event i went to and i thought i would write an i love emilia sign to take a picture with her wow so original right i made the sign and went to ask her but i soon as i said hi would you mind taking a picture with me while i hold th she took the sign from my hand to read it and then shouted you son of a bitch she was joking of course she looked a bit mad but she was smiling and her friend who was cosplaying as ram fistbumped me and i got a really cool photo of me with the sign and remrin frowning with her arms crossed
anime,removed,technically not female i believe this is covered in gig theres a scene where batou and the major are talking and the major mentions it is easier to do their job in a female body
anime,removed,sorry op but take your nonanime art elsewhere kappa we have no use for powerpuff girls on this exclusive anime sub kappa
anime,removed,you will probably tear it apart when you find out the crap hes done
anime,removed,especially a certain female character who is behind the conspiracy of the entire show
anime,removed,i would say cory not everyone gets him
anime,removed,propably because everything about him speaks plot convenience he is stupid when he needs to be it took the idiot three deaths to realize that he revives everytime and he is the best strategist out there when plot needs him to be the whole white whale preparations also everytime emilia shows up he loses like iq points and becomes a dumb neckbeard white knight i dont like his design because he is completely inconsistent character without a purpose its good that the author pointed out the flaws in nice guy and white knight tropes in anime but this is not enough to be most well written character of the year imo
anime,removed,i really like her too shes a great tragic fallen hero
anime,removed,lain too stoned to even try to start explaining that animeits like she is the internet yeah

anime,removed,the only thing i really hate about nadeko is that she never gets her ass kicked she basically gets out of the whole story unscathed where everybody else had to go through hell and back multiple time just to put up with her shit shes well written but damn shes a huge bitch
anime,removed,the mangas all finished im hoping someone has read ahead and knows the answer they arent related by blood in s usagi drop either doesnt make it any less creepy konatsu is his best friends and exgirlfriends daughter hes played a big role in her upbringing its at least a little creepy if so

anime,removed,technically it is but the volume starts and ends post events of s tet wasnt lying his ass off the whole time
anime,removed,dude i dont usually say this to people rarely ever in fact but you are a fucking idiot ok first off kill la kill really dude that anime was basically trying its best to follow in the wake and copy gurren lagann while failing miserably i mean honestly if you just rage quit an anime after two episodes youre already questionable but dropping a show with as much praise as gurren lagann so let me describe something to you in gurren lagann at the end of the second movie we see a being whose foot is bigger than our universe a being literally multiversal in length fighting against another multiversal enemy that then caused the entire collapse of reality into a single point like really what the fuck kill la kill came after gurren lagann made by the same studio same animation team but they could never come close to recreating it theres a reason gurren lagann is known as the anime that changes lives and theres a reason why kill la kill is just called stupid now i have to go wash off the foolishness

anime,removed,actually i was just talking about it with my brother but why is he sloth like subaru is pride makes sense the betelguese is like the least lazy and most diligent person in the show
anime,removed,it was forgotten no really its better if they dont show the pv because it can potentially spoil the entire episode
anime,removed,team who
anime,removed,go back to mudslime land you mudslime faggot
anime,removed,at the beginning he was fine as a spy for but when he turned into a selfish yandere little brother who can only see himself and murdered shirley for his brothers sake he never changed from that point he kept on being the selfish dependent kid who only loves lelouchs existence but without actually caring about him and he earned affection for it which is total bs how lelouch managed to go from hating him to death and back and swearing to kill him painfully to calling him his true brother and cry for him in just a few minutes yeah hes sacrificing himself but we already know that hes been willing to do that since a long time ago and lelouch himself knew that as well and has already been using rolo as a tool and having him risk his life doing his bidding the entire time
anime,removed,ok so you just want a quick sum up of what you saw i only watched this once myself holding out on a rewatch till i can buy the blu ray so hopefully im doing this right and of course spoilers below ok so we have characters mitsuha and taki they are about the same age taki is into art and his free time is mostly taken up by working at a restaurant where he seems to have a crush on his coworker mitsuhas family works at a shrine her father is a politician who no longer seems to live with them and her mother is as per usual of way too many anime dead she is looked after be her maternal grandmother the movie if i recall starts in a jagged pattern of showing the body switching taking place the first time one moment and the next showing things normal the day after so were going back and forth between the characters between those days for a bit this is meant to throw the audience for a loop so nobody really understands what the heck was going on in the movie till more info is given as it progresses they are confused because these switches are dreamlike so after only happening time they forgot mostall of said random dream whatever whatever mitsuha takes part in a ritual for the shrine and is embarrassed that drink item that is being made will come back into the story later more body witching happens and the characters figure it out and start setting up rules on how to handle this they are remembering these dreams better and better because they reoccurring every few days and they now start to mess with each others lives as some weird act of rebellion attempttobehelpfull since their counterpart is doing the same so basically they are becoming friends and doing things that friends do taki travels with mitsuhas granny to some spiritual place and puts that drink form early there as per ritual it supposedly represent half the spirit of who performed in the ritual again this will come into the story later ok the time stuff stars to kick in mitsuha has been seeing on the news about an upcoming comet and how its going to be gorgeous she is excited to see this taki saw a gorgious comet a while back and has now clue what comet mitsuha is talking about in her posts right now he cant find it in the sky that night and decides to call her to ask about it no reply weird mitsuha sees comet it goes boom theres that so apparently she and he were on different points in time years back taki saw that comet and after that it hit some town in the middle of nowhere and killed everyone there mitsuha is in that town now years prior so they had been body swapping and time swapping he doesnt know that though and doesnt recall the towns name this was all a reoccurring dream after all so details are hazy his artsy side is amazing though so he draws some landmarks and goes out hunting this place down he does this for a while finnaly finds the place and discovers the time difference that had been happening and comes to find that he no longer recalls his dreambuddys name he happens to have some bracelet that he doesnt recall who gave to him from years ago and notices that its braided like the ropes from the shrine in his bodyswapping dreams some more memories come surging back and he decides to push foreward we saw that rope in the begining of the movie when mitsuha throws it to him that was made to make no sense then and is made to make even less sense now as per usual the story will come back to that explaining that luck charm now actually because i dont recall the exact timestamp it happened in the story on the day before the comet mitsuha decided to meet up with taki for real she decides to surprise him and travels to tokyo but when she finds him he doesnt recognize her time difference remember she is confused and sad but decides to not let this stop her or her feelings so she gives him her corded headband thats the one taki later has forgotten where it came from but wears on his wrist as a good luck charm taki decides to kick start another dream sequence and attempt to save the town from years back he goes to that sacred place and drinks that drink from earlier ok that drink has served its final piece in this story and woosh timebody swap occurs he has one of mitsuahas friends whose father in the beginning of the film was told that he would train with construction explosives later help takimitsuha make a bomb to freak out the village theyll loose power and evacuate and all survive the upcoming comet of doom mitsuhas other friend helps out by working the emergency announcement system obviously the adults dont take well to children seemingly randomly acting as terrorists before the adults got super angry though taki as mitsuha went up to that spiritual place and is able to talk to mistuha it was said in school that twightlight was a time when the spirit would and the real world sort of combined and with mitsuha in takis body already being at that place years later after taking that drink to kickstart the swap that last time they are able to meet and talk he returns her hairbandluckcharm and kind of apologizes for not knowing her and meeting properly hose years backyesterday yay that reality happens taki gets pulled back to modern time and mitsuha has mere hours to reattempt to convince her father to evacuate the town and now that the dreamswitching is officially over those dreamlike memories start fading again soon even the other persons name is forgotten mitsuha has her hairband and taki has lost his random luck charm so its not like that is going to be able to kickstart memories now opps to that turns out mitsuha had managed to convince the her father and most of the town was saved they dont tell us whether mitsuha herself got out in time so there is a minor element of what if time passes their memories are pretty much entirely gone of that time but they still are confused and miss this unknown person from their old forgotten dreams years pass all seems lost but they meet after all dear god mitsuha really did live they dont know each other but they sort of do so destiny or whatever yay
anime,removed,im scared about alisha getting killed
anime,removed,imgur comment has it right something somethingid jerk off over her while shes in a coma
anime,removed,they didnt show the best part of the ending no salty people thanks to that expect spoiled ones
anime,removed,rem who
anime,removed,what i wanted to say for a while now was the supposedly new title of the show s starting salt in a subreddit from zero s that scene never happened
anime,removed,ohhhh boy i was spoiled about a month ago and ive been hotly anticipating this shitstorm ever since oilup
anime,removed,i know people are going to be justifiably disappointed that white fox opted to not finish arc in its entirety and instead decided to cut off subaru mid dialogue but for what its worth its probably the safest thing they could have done all things considered not going to outright say what happens but ill tag them as spoilers just in case dont read if you dont want to get any ideas of what may happen just after the anime ends s they cut off at subaru talking which implies it was a big deal and to appease the ln readers or those of you who read the pastebin lolwho know what it was s give a happy ending to people who hate bad endings to maximize sales in general which might help chances of a s if is a thing it will start off with subaru getting wrecked which generates interest at the end i want to say for a series that i admittedly thought was going to be yet anotherdude stuck in fanatsy world lmao anime i was surprised by rezero one of the best series to come out this year imo
anime,removed,i havent been this mad in a long long while they had the opportunity to create the greatest shitstorm anime has seen since code geass finale and they fucked it up seriously its disgusting it seems like they werent sure if will get greenlit and decided to avoid finishing on a cliffhanger
anime,removed,well that was a complete disaster they didnt even include literally the most important scene in the entire series just for a forced happy end between subaru and emilia it doesnt even make sense they even alluded to it with the blank letter and everything i can tell a lot more people will be mad about this too the anime basically created its own plothole so now the complete lack of rem for the last episodes makes no sense as if she was written out of the story or something i dont fault them for doing this though it makes sense why they would end it here white fox didnt want to risk hearing outrage from fans if they left it at a brutal cliffhanger like that so they just decided to play it safe but now people are still going to be outraged just for a completely different reason i guess all three remaining emilia fans will be happy was an okay show overall some things were bad some were good this ending definitely wasnt though i dont care about emilia as a character so the entire last ten god damn minutes were a chore for me
anime,removed,this is what ill only say for episode it was a perfect ending in a way it was actually great now in regards to it white fox stopped before it now i dont know why they did it but my guess is they werent actually sure if they could have done a second season so they ended it there now judging by how much positive response the series is getting i think they will be going for a second season in a few years jp twitter is now at tweets about episode and the response is so positive theyll be thinking about it for sure
anime,removed,psa the thread is flooded with spoilers of a scene that wasnt adapted that massively changes the story please delete the spoiler comments or just avoid the thread
anime,removed,more related to rose
anime,removed,can you explain the shitstorm youre talking about
anime,removed,hanasaku iroha ill admit i only watched this show because of these pictures in fact i thought she was the main character and was slightly disappointed seconds into the show when i found out i was wrong still i really enjoyed it but wasnt expecting the romance it portrays long distance relationships in a realistic manner and i loved that found myself tearing up a few moments the main setting is a bath houseinn which is unique beautiful soundtrack and visuals all of the characters are charming especially the main character but i kind of cringed everything she said her catch phrase i wasnt a fan of the s erotic novel writer he annoyed me frequently but he did have some good moments all of the characters really care about each other and show really illustrates hard work some people dont like the manager or the mom but by the end of the show you realize they do love each other but show it in different wayss i know some people consider minko a bitchand yeah she kind of acts like one sometimes however its really realistic when the person you love loves someone else even more so when that person is a coworkerfriend s my biggest problem with the anime is near the end with episode mostly most of the staff being much hating and ignoring iroha because they dont agree with her even characters who are usually nice show hostility then after everything is revolved over a friendship speech none of them even bother apologizing and everyone continues like nothing happened besides this i really enjoyed it score hanasaku iroha home sweet home now if you enjoyed the anime you will probably enjoy this it was good for the most part but i have issues with the content in the movie s the best parts of the movie were with ohanas mother it shows her childhood and how she acted with her moth how she meets ohanas father falling in love with him choosing her future and etc however these moemnts only make up about one third of the film the rest of the film is pointless problems from the staff i love the staff but they really took up too much of the time which should have been on ohanas family despite me disliking how they set up the movie if you like ohana and her family or just the anime in general its well worth watching at least once score the disappearance of haruhi suzumiya it took what i loved about the anime and multiplied it by eight the movie outshines the anime in almost every way but you need to watch the anime to really enjoy it the movie is three hours long which is a long for an anime movie but it doesnt feel that way once you start watching it the movie focuses on the disappearance of haruhii know like the title didnt give it away the entire world seemingly gets turned on its head and of course kyon has to figure out what went wrong when we finally see the culprit and the reasoning why it makes sense as hints were thrown throughout the anime itself the song that plays during the credits is truly heart breaking score monster you know that moment where you read a manga and love a character to death you find out theirs an anime and you hear the character speak lines for the first time and the voice actor absolutely nails it as soon as johan spoke for the first time i got chills the only downside to this anime would possibly be the pacing and how slow it is sometimes however none of the episodes are really filler but instead add to the story and offer up background information the filler episodes show how tenma and johan affect the people around them and most of them come back for a few scenes besides the main characters the side characters are equally developed and often face difficult choices are typically presented in the grey area you will love some characters hate others and love ones you initially hated also the anime did a damn good job adapting the manga from what i remember score katangatari art design is interesting and intriguing but not for everyone the relationship between the two main characters and the story are the focal points of the anime shichika is straight forward and honest despite his cheerful nature he is one of the scariest people in the anime other peoples lives mean little to him and is willing to kill them if he simply has too togame is busy tsundering and breaking the fourth wall on the occasion their relationship blossoms with each episode and becomes more romantic and touching both of them change throughout the anime but mostly shichika s people die in this anime i mean a lot one of the main groups of the show is the maniwa corp made of different ninjas based off animals almost all of them die and most of them are awesome togame dies as well but she needs to look up the definition of dying words dying words are supposed to be brief but she gave a minute speech while bleeding out can you please die already the last death i will mention is my favorite character which some people dislike nanami she is cute and an overpowered badass i didnt mind her dying as much as the rest but i had major problems with the quality of the episode it looked really sloppy and crudely made what could have been a touching hard work beats genius arcepisode felt rushed and sloppy s the final episodes are amazing especially with shichika you see how much togames death affected him his speech and fighting style completely change and he shows no mercy score
anime,removed,to people wondering what the hell others are talking about in the novels the arc ends with s emilia saying whos rem
anime,removed,welp time to go restart from s episode
anime,removed,but nowhere near the expected levels

anime,removed,why rezero you were supposed to save anime from boring shows with perfect happy endings not join them where is our shitstorm where is ultimate most important scene of this entire arc
anime,removed,i know a lot of people are salty but man that was one of the wildest rides ive experienced in anime its been a while since i looked forward to a show so much each and every week vas killed it left and right great animation beautiful backgrounds fantastic characters i loved it the ending did seem a bit cutoff though
anime,removed,s whos rem
anime,removed,honestly amazing i love this show it was amazing watching it every week with you guys
anime,removed,i dont know about the ones who were wanting a shitstorm but i sure am enjoying the salty shitstorm being caused by the very people who wanted others to be salty and cause a shitstorm
anime,removed,s who is rem
anime,removed,i think two words will suffice s whos rem
anime,removed,that last scene was supposed to be the calm before the storm but the storm never came
anime,removed,even the animators s forgot rem
anime,removed,in a nutshell s rem cruches team was ambushed by bishop of gluttony rem is erased from existence her body is in a coma like how the white whale does with his mist cruche loses her memory and personality subaru finds out that he cannot undo this because defeating betelgeuse overwrote the save point and can no longer go back to save rem despair ensues
anime,removed,s from what ive read something happens to make emilia say whos rem
anime,removed,they even alluded to it with the blank letter and shit all they needed was my boy to say something about rem and then emilia being like subaru whos rem shock looked on subarus face cut to credits money
anime,removed,rem who
anime,removed,i heard about the lns ending which people are outraged about and i agree to preferring it despite only watching the anime why because the whole time i was wondering where the gutwrenching tragedy of this series went on the edge of my seat as everything went right with the sole thought going through my head from what angle is the shit going to hit the fan and i was let down by the lack of mindfuckery
anime,removed,if the anime went a couple minutes more it would have gotten to rem and believe me you wouldnt have been happy
anime,removed,which is why were mad its not so much that they cut off a cliff hanger thats important too the biggest problem that they cut off the scene in the middle of a convo so when the next season picks up it will have an oddly paced opening
anime,removed,this was a decent end for the series a few things from the web novel that may clear a fw things please note these are from the wen novel which may or may not ave changed in the light novel the light novel which will cover this episode will be release this week so well find out then what has or has not changed it turns out that beteleguis may have been a spirt like ia puck or beatrice betelegius takes over bodies that have the witch factor all the fingers had them subaru apperently too what exactly is the witch facor remains a mystery in this act but it something felix can detect when he touchs a person that is how he found out that finger merchant as he had a similar odd presense that betelegius original and red hair girl had when in the first loop of this battle betelegius asks subaru to show this when he asks him about he gospel in the second loop of this battle in the first loop of this battle when emilia fights betelegius puck could not engage in the battle apparently he is bound by a pact to not interfer with the trial he did not remember this until he tried to join this is likely changed in the light novels the epilogue for this episodeact was cut when subaru and emilia travel back to cruschs mansion subaru brings up rem in the conversation emilias response who is rem if you look back to the loop when otto pushed subaru off his wagon otto was killed on the road the great tree and rosewalls manar are about hours apart this means there was another set of cultist on the road betelegius had no contact with these cultist as he didnt know the white whale was killed subaru confrims this when he was buffling with betelegius subaru blames himself for this mistake his had the clues but didnt releasize it in time after subaru left for rosewalls manor crusch and rem encounter the archbishop of greed regulus and the archbishop of gluttony batenkaitos there was no hope the archbishop of greed according to julius is an extremely powerful being rumor to have singlehandly wiped out the capital city of the neighboring kingdom note subaru betelegius regulus and batenkaitos are stars rem and crusch are alive rem is in deep sleep able to be awoken no one remember her crusch lost all her memory she acts as a lost girl ferris wants to break off the alliance subaru upon seeing rem immediately takes a knife and slit his throat after death he returns by rems bedside this is the new save point subarus sufer only just begins
anime,removed,not spoiling anything yes next episode is a good ending with some great summary of time changing and parallel worlds
anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,rem is my waifu and i can say without a doubt im salty about this ending and its not even because of emilia s i hate what they cut out and i wish they left it in but atleast it was nice that they put both endings in the episode
anime,removed,well the twist i was expecting didnt happen but thats a good thing for now emilia got a beautiful happy ending and s rem is just offscreen
anime,removed,holy shit a twitter everything is filled with rezero now a lot of people arent happy that white fox didnt include s who is rem also dont go on a they already discuss arc and so on unless you dont care about being spoiled
anime,removed,i recommend you reading this it happens right after the white whale battle
anime,removed,fucking white fooooooxxx ending the episode literally just before s who is rem im mad right now
anime,removed,explain how this is in any way an anime only ending they stopped before that moment but that doesnt mean its anime only plus the author confirmed this episode as canon so i have no idea what youre talking about
anime,removed,major rezero ln spoilers wait but how s wasnt she in the city how did she get erased was that explained yet in the ln
anime,removed,over justice vs lalaco godspeed it ended in a draw so we will never know who was the strongest
anime,removed,apology for poor english when were you when rem i was at field talking to emilia when she say s who is rem no
anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,s he asks about rem and emilia just goes who is rem
anime,removed,everyone who wants to know why some of us are mad and where we thought they would have ended the ep read this and please upvote so others will see it too s when rem and crusch left to the capital with the white whales head they were attacked by two archbishops archbishop of greed and archbishop of gluttony crusch got her arm cut off and memories eaten and rem got her existence and memories eaten when emilia talks to subaru subaru starts to talk about rem and emilia finally asks who is rem this is the part we thought the ep would have ended however they ended literally just before it subarus save point updated so he cant save her
anime,removed,well more accurately a show that doesnt know when its getting a season if its as long as a delay of attack on titan then i dont mind shifting the cliffhanger to the start of
anime,removed,s you know that rem doesnt exist anymore dont you
anime,removed,personally i think she isnt the witch yet but eventually something will happenprobably subaru permanently dying which will cause her to become the witch and go back in time to cast return by death wiping out half of the world in the process
anime,removed,s oh god just when i thought the whos rem meme is over and now is coming back again
anime,removed,sthe thing is the ones who sent them can never know if the miracle happens even if they found a real time travel machine due to multiverse theory so they mail the letters on faith and hope alone
anime,removed,rem is serving under roswaal first and foremost but emilia is the one who convinced ferris which roswaal says is quite a feat formed a contract with crusch and maintained the contract even after their dispute just for them to recuperate in the capital
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,if anyone doesnt want to wait a couple years for or is too lazy to read the wn here is the continuation of the story that i formatted in a pastebin including who gets crowned and a love interest that is developed s
anime,removed,use a vpn
anime,removed,use the crunchyroll unblocker chrome extension and animelab and thatll cover almost all your needs for airing anime otherwise just torrent things that you cant stream and buy the series that you most enjoy on dvdbd or some other merchandise theres actually a wide range of things to buy in ausnz and at decent prices too
anime,removed,hehe hehehehe hahahahahaha
anime,removed,be glad they didnt have an after credit scene
anime,removed,what a ride i know most of us wont want to wait a few year for so here you go web novels in japanese web novels in chinnese translation is halfway through the the show ended at the end of right before the epilogues web novels in english i dunno someone help me here
anime,removed,holy shit the blank letter didnt even occur to me what the fuck
anime,removed,holy fk that would explain the blank letter mind blowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
anime,removed,guess some people never grow out their teen phase
anime,removed,but imagine if they actually ended the series on a spoiler note i actually think thatd have been awesome
anime,removed,yeah ive heard so ive been meaning to give the manga a go too while the mcs dont interest me in the slightest id really like to know whats going on with the s esper children
anime,removed,leave it to ranime to go for ad hominem the moment they get triggered
anime,removed,because the contents got erased i guess
anime,removed,its because the anime never tells us who wrote the letter but now you can understand it from the spoiler right
anime,removed,someone who isnt me knows a website where you can download all the music from seasonal anime for free they may be willing to share if you message them
anime,removed,lol
anime,removed,s thanks
anime,removed,so much happened during these episodes i dont even know how to keep this short well first of all im loving the new op its high beat and gets you to your feels because it is clear that this show starts to gear up for the end nagisa is such a man his decision making is top notch korosenseis backstory of how he came to be was interesting and made sense no complaints there also was that a lelouch va that voiced s reaperhuman korosensei red vs blu fight was awesome i love these kind of parts in this show theyre so well done everyone gets to shine s im actually surprised with the conclusion of that fight because i was rooting for karma to win but the way they agreed on making the decision is fine by me iss episode was pretty fun the english there was international well as long as its understandable its ok also s ritsu moment was sweet oh karasuma smuglancer the whole scene with him and irina went so smooth i couldnt believe at the outcome at first i have some problems with what i saw in the last episodes i watched they started out so well but then kind of started to make less and less sense well see how they end it before saying anything really rewatch group has caught up to me so now im watching these daily surprisingly the show started to get a bit better not sure if its my big battle bias turning on here but at least im starting to like the show a bit more finally managed to finish this show if i were to describe it id say its a cute fun and fanservicy show about high school girl club and their motorcycles in the end this show is nothing special although it had good amount of funny moments and it had a few really well made moments like the s reality twist was rather touching but those moments were far and few inbetween i liked the show overall but my guess there are better alternatives
anime,removed,as far as endings go this is honestly a perfect way to end it its basically ended in the middle of what was to be if season happens your immediately going to have the knife inserted and brutally twisted within episodes should be some hype shit
anime,removed,well it makes somehow makes sense this happened a second time in the manga sin the fight between deku and muscle man deku used of his power which was mistranslation because the mangaka meant but he said this to motivate himself with this power up he defeated his enemy while hurting himself more than ever before the doctor explained that humans limit their strength because they can end up hurting themselves if they use their full strength he punched harder with more than of his power becausd of an adrenaline rush which made it possible for him to tap in his real of power this ended up hurting himself more
anime,removed,awwwwwwwwwww i thought they would stop at s whos rem c
anime,removed,s lost an arm and amnesia is lost
anime,removed,not necessarily i wont say any spoilers about their contract but just because something is in the contract it doesnt mean emilia wants it there
anime,removed,it was extremely clear that she killed him because of her grudge against the witchs cult rather than considering him a threat not to mention she went against roswells orders since he didnt want him killed
anime,removed,personally i find it a much more relatable and realistic human drama than shigatsu with the death of one the main characters somewhat cheap in order to instill some feeling with the viewer sangatsu however is more about how each and every individual character matures and to see the daily struggle they go through which mirrors reality thus resonates better with the viewerreader alternate note i think piano no mori at least the manga version does what shigatsu does but better now bring on the downvotes
anime,removed,im glad they give it a happy ending to season one because if they went another way then half of the fan base would commit seppuku heres a hint think about the blank letter google saburu synopsis for the rest
anime,removed,cant remember exactly but its after his death i remember he is not able to stop that event that was cut from this episode from happening
anime,removed,
anime,removed,just finished the ennies lobby arc in one very late night easily the best yet every single character had their time to shine the authors getting better at actually evoking emotion i actually teared up at robins backstory and s the death of the going merry just no why its good to see the plot move forward though i was hoping smokey would be the one hunting them the whole series speaking of which what is he up to havent heard from him in ages franky is the man super excited to see s him join the team
anime,removed,baka tsuki has up to vol translated but i dont know any news about the authors plans on releasing more
anime,removed,i will say it doesnt strike you as a show that it would happen in but the way it happened was pretty tame but that also could be because i watch stuff like game of thrones and have seen anime akame ga kill comes to mind where characters have died in the some really brutal ways
anime,removed,if you watch the show ikki normally use itto shura at the end of the fight after learning enemy movement the move allow him to boost his speedstrength or response by shutting down his other unused ability for that moment like colour recognition for a limited amount of time also this fight happens after he was locked up for days to prevent him from winning the tournament the match ended is split second both using the ability to their up most level if you watched the show you know the heaviness of why he cant lose this tournament and the emotion that involved when he swing that sword in addition to the black and white animation that shows the intensity of that moment other matches before this are just like other common battle anime with flashy moves and strategy this one is different from those
anime,removed,first step into the abyss dragonball digimon i was watching anime since before i could read and had my mother record all anime for me i was living with my grandparents so i could watch them on vhs so i might actually already been an intense fan at that point dragonball got me interested at first and digimon got me emotionally invested it carried on into a manga obsession since at some point the telly programm were giving little new material step two haruhi on youtube in crap quality the next step was the time we got limitless internet somewhere in the middle of the my early aol wasnt fit for anything but as when i got dsl with flat i discovered anime in horrible quality on youtube i remember ripping haruhi episodes that might as well been rorschach tests so that was another milestone i also bought a pc gaming magazine the screenfun that at one point featured an episode of hellsing with every magazine so i enjoyed that at that time my options were pretty limited though and was mostly buying manga three steps and i became a sinner thanks soul eater but truly the moment when i got really into the internet scene was somewhere around when i found a site with illegal anime when i was looking for soul eater it was sorted and pretty and had them subbed in german i was baffled how easy it was to download via dl since i was pretty scared of emule and torrent after a friend got knocked i started to intensively pirate and discover anime that looked interesting i really got into it and watched everything from code geass to soul eater to kanokon and this was of course was when i got into the community step iv you know youre a weeb when angel beats makes you blog in anger while i was before mainly talking with friends maybe skimming reviews and discussions in some german forums i got really angry when i saw angel beats airing in and on my rampage i was looking for opinions like mine with this i stumbled upon a blog that was trashing it and after reading through some comments i decided to make my own blog where i would do blog things about manga and anime i tried to write meaningful reviews and articles though i didnt succeed as well as i thought while writing along the way i decided that i would switch to english subs since they were faster and felt better german subs sounded very awkward to me step this has nothing to do with the question anymore but i add it anyway because i can at some point i didnt like the atmosphere in the german blogosphere anymore and since i learned via references of other germans blogs about major english ones i then started to read english blogs like random curiosity from there i committed myself to the english community and started to hang out exclusively on english websites when it was possible around that point i finished school and committed myself even more to anime and started to organize my viewing habits more systematically and well a few months ago i started to actively contribute here with my dank memes and pedantic complaining about semantics at what step did i become a weeb was it when i was in gradeschool and binging vhs tapes of recorded anime was it when i started to explore the joy of the internet or was it when i went ranting in the internet about anime i didnt like
anime,removed,you mean shitty anime
anime,removed,and what about soundtracks i really hope that we soon will see real alternative to youtube but there is currently noone who can take youtubes place copyright why they dont get that youtube is greatest way to advertise something be it anime music serials movies etc
anime,removed,surprise suprise another shitty anime
anime,removed,i think alot of the hate the show gets is from alfenheim or what ever the elf world is called you combine the asuna rape theme by some annoying voiced creep to the whole secret incest storyline that was pukeworthy i know japs love their forbidden incest stories apparently i read its due to most of them being single childs with no sisters hence no understanding but it was really cringe and bad taste id go as far to tell people to skip that arc and read a plot summary maybe look at the fight scenes that ot was so bad at least sao kinda redemed its self with gun gale arc
anime,removed,i really liked the movie it was nice to see it had a pretty dark subject matter yet kept a bright cheerful demeanor throughout it that one scene with the boat was really heartbreaking as well i walked into it expecting it to be nonstop soulcrushing torrent sorrow and hopelessness
anime,removed,monogatari is not a harem arararagi walked hitagi home gently sword art online is not a harem kirito is dating asuna and had sex with her two years worth of glop mahouka is not a harem oniisama is asexual and can only have feelings for miyuki nisekoi is not a harem ichijou is in love with onodera and as the title suggest his love for chitoge is fake toradora is not a harem taiga fucking won yahari is not a harem has been shown to have no romantic interest in any of them just sexual attraction danmachi is not a harem bell is clearly shown to only have interest in ais index is not a harem touma punches every girl he meets thats not love log horizon is not a harem shirou is not a pedo and the only other valid contender is akatsuki cross ange is not a harem ange is straight and has no feelings for hilda plus she and tusk had sex absolute duo is not a harem why do you think its called absolute duo and not absolute harem the world god only knows is not a harem keima confessed his love to chihiro dog days is not a harem cinque and millhiore declared their love for each other rebecca has no chance oreshura is not a harem eita is dating silver they even kissed in front of everyone love hina is not a harem keitaro and naru got married and they love each other very much saekano is not a harem its about how to raise a boring girlfriend rakudai is not a harem ikki proposes to stella in vol i repeat rakudai is not a harem you know whats a harem asterisk asterisk is a shitty generic battle harem unlike rakudai which is sophisticated and has a well though out romance
anime,removed,excited for guts vs mozgus final form
anime,removed,yeah yeah yeah we in there bois man kira sure wears a nice watch
anime,removed,this episode doesnt leave much in way of discussion all the meat is in ein dont eat him spike whose discussion would effectively be a wall of spoilers so i will just wait to comment appropriately as his character fleshes out great episodic story and the music totally gets me very wellcomposed highlights i got some heavy though brief dr laughton metropolis feels from our cosmectic surgeon doc doesnt help that prescott voiced them both interesting parallelinfluence that i never noticed before you see all the influence culture has on bebop but i never really pick up on the versa very cool indeed refernce someone get me its so stinking cute akways pull a chuckle from me next up
anime,removed,koichi being at an airport would be a nice part teaser
anime,removed,in this episode jotaro and the mighty star platinum get destroyed by a toy car kiras got a nice watch hope it doesnt break koichi has finally managed to turn his stand into perfect cell echoes jotaro sure has changed he really is better as a mentor than as the mc give me an s give me an h give me an i give me a t shit great episode overall the music was on point making the time stop come out of starplats jewel is a nice touch
anime,removed,so effect is removed which causes the causes during that effect to affect the effects of other causes in order to cause and effective affected time where causes are added to be effected and removed but preserving effect of affected causes obviously
anime,removed,yes
anime,removed,yes but it may not even reach that point
anime,removed,i actually like piracy more than any legit way of watching anime including modern streaming services well i had general awareness of anime being a thing having seen a couple of episodes of pokemon and sailor moon in early childhood as well as shaman king and naruto on jetix but we never had a consistent source of anime on tv as far as watching it consciously goes i noticed haruhi on a local torrent tracker i was using at the time and decided to give it a go i was curious about what the anime actually was like but not enough to look for it deliberately i liked it so i decided to watch other titles available there mostly popular stuff around that time like death note and black lagoon once i ran out of stuff that looked interesting on the local torrent tracker i started using a tracker that specialized in anime i still get anime the same way except for using western trackers instead of local and russian ones and having learned english in the process
anime,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtwjfbufcjum
anime,removed,s yes
anime,removed,i really dislike this characteri cant say why because still couldnt figure out how to use spoiler tag
anime,removed,idk i just used torrents usenet and irc to grab whatever shows i was looking for i never watched toonami so for me its just become more convenient with the various streaming sites as well as things like plex to organize my library
anime,removed,isnt it kind of like mirai nikki a girl from an alternate universe has a crushloves the mc
anime,removed,and now we wait for the doujins
anime,removed,while his older brother does not
anime,removed,is code geass and is nanoha
anime,removed,terrorist bombs a city and get involves with a depressed girl they then die but the girl didnt
anime,removed,in relation to other protagonists soma doesnt really have plot armor though i do know of a specific match up further into the manga where all i can really write it off as is plot armor but until then i feel like its pretty legitimate writing
anime,removed,guy collects people from other people with the help of someone for a living s he later collects her wanted to spoil as little as possible
anime,removed,
anime,removed,
anime,removed,
anime,removed,if they dated i would be so happy
anime,removed,s and subaru being crushed by ram and rem yeah those were the times
anime,removed,fuck off
anime,removed,he said boring not awesome
anime,removed,i didnt watch the remake yet only the episode versio id say give it a shot coz some parts are vastly different from the remake it stops at when pakunoda died
anime,removed,i kind of want someone to recommend a person the anime based on this clip alone and see what their reactions are when subaru starts s constantly getting his head smashedcut off
anime,removed,i promise to everyone who hates subaru right now that hes actually a pretty lovable character no seriously i promise
anime,removed,yeah some of them are awesome but some are batshit crazy
anime,removed,t minus episodes
anime,removed,t
anime,removed,he definitely wont have the chance to anymore either
anime,removed,s rezero
anime,removed,thank god maria and mamuro got away safe
anime,removed,he actually already has that one in rezero
anime,removed,its funny how you say that gotta remember the matchup with his dad man also read the manga

anime,removed,why is the autistic girl the best girl lol vigne best girl imo
anime,removed,youjo senki it has only just started but i liked the cover on kiss anime
anime,removed,its only explained why in heavens feel but the grails corruption is definitely known in the other routes as well
anime,removed,fuck this weeb shit keep your hentai on the proper subs
anime,removed,also
anime,removed,httpiimgurcomojncndggif
anime,removed,lets not get into that discussion again
anime,removed,should have known it was one of these the memes never die
anime,removed,i was hoping it wasnt going to be the towel it ended up being the towel thoughtful
anime,removed,was about to say hey i should tell usandakurage about the pitou posted on ranime i should have known
anime,removed,i really need to catch up on the hxh rewatch cant wait to get to when they introduce this cute catgirl
anime,removed,shes the demon king all along
anime,removed,best trap ever
anime,removed,she has boobs its a fucking female no matter how you spin it
anime,removed,you just keeping telling yourslef that pitou has boobs they didnt show her having a dick therefore the only logical explanation is that pitou is a female deal with it
anime,removed,yeah no togashi isnt a tumblrina sorry
anime,removed,in both the manga and the anime she is female pitou is genderambiguous in both the manga and anime its a common manga mindgame youre the one who needs to stop spreading misinformation it is accurate to have your opinion about pitous gender and refer to pitou as either he or she on a personal level however to assert your opinion as fact only proves youre blindly accepting of cultural understanding of gender arguing for either male or female instead of accepting the ambiguity means only that you lost the mindgame a pitou is male you lose togashi wins b pitou is female you lose togashi wins c pitou is not male you lose togashi wins d pitou is not female you lose togashi wins fictional characters can be ambiguous because thats the nature of fiction
anime,removed,itt people thinking pitou is male
anime,removed,well i mean some people draw girls and call them boys so you cant really tell somebody sometimes that hah you feel for it it has boobs in the show a small cup but it still does exist child bearing hips and acts like a mother with all feminine actions and facial expressions haha you idiot really fell for that one cant really be said since its just not really expanded on well in the manga pitou looks and acts like a dude and in the anime its the complete opposite infact theres proof for both sides and togashis genderambiguity doesnt even apply to the show because he didnt create the character there other people did and heavily pushed a female appearance where most people got their information from with the gender of pitou it would be different if people based their opinion from the manga
anime,removed,did you just assume its gender
anime,removed,pitou is female on a scale of to already ten posts in this thread about some gender ambiguity shit more than half of which you already deleted because you cant stand getting downvoted how triggered are you right now
anime,removed,spoiler it doesnt nor does it want to thats that worst part its solely an angst piece
anime,removed,togashi and many other mangaka know how easy it is to trigger children yeah clearly at least you were right about one thing
anime,removed,so why is this outfit so big again out of no where
anime,removed,pitou is genderless
anime,removed,did we just assume her gender 😱 side note will there be a continuation of the series it was one of my favorite anime shows
anime,removed,he actually made him a boy in the manga but regretted it so he was a she in the anime sorry to burst your sjw bubble
anime,removed,i think this new fad is growing on me
anime,removed,httpiimgurcombfibwbgjpg
anime,removed,well to be fair most of them didnt originally til the most recent mod additions where we got new mods that were once users here with us
anime,removed,let do it we kidnap togashi and make him talk
anime,removed,man whats up with hxh and gender ambiguity killuas sisterbrother is kinda in the same boat
anime,removed,wait pitou was born fully clothed doesnt that mean that the clothes were part of it essentially pitou in this fanart has been stripped of her upper layer of skin

anime,removed,please tag this for erased spoilers and ill reapprove
anime,removed,please tag for erased spoilers
anime,removed,please tag for erased spoilers
anime,removed,female people thinking otherwise want a dick in the ass
anime,removed,itt people arguing whether or not a sexually ambiguous character is female or not so they can fap without a guilty conscience bro its already not real what difference does it make
anime,removed,looks like a girl so is biologically female right glad to know that seeing the physical appearance of a character in a manga has given you knowledge to make the claim that you know the biological sex of a character you could claim to know that pitou is presented in the manga as female but to make the statement that you know that the character is canonically biologically female is unjustified and therefore not knowledge by most theories of knowledge
anime,removed,no she is female why are their idiots thinking she has a dick
anime,removed,can someone explain what this meme trend going on refers to apparently i live under a rock
anime,removed,pitou is neither male or female as the queen is the only one with a sex chimera are based on an insect that are that way
anime,removed,wooo some pitou fanart and with the virgin killer sweater at that

anime,removed,at least emilia didnt kill subaru d
anime,removed,kys
anime,removed,here is my episode review
anime,removed,umwat
anime,removed,okay welp now all we need to do is wait til the very last second of this series im interested in seeing how people react once this anime ends even now its interesting kind of to see whos rooting for which side
anime,removed,shinsekai yori is like psycho pass you have fanatics mindlessly defending its flaws and denying there are problems it gets tiring hearing unintelligently written sentences adding nothing to discussion
anime,removed,be sure to watch right after and bring tissues for both of them
anime,removed,yeah this is one i agree with there have been absolutely fantastic dubs bebop fma and brotherhood gurren lagann steinsgate even kill la kill had amazing voices in there holy crap mako sounds tolerable in english give christine marie cabanos all the money it extends to japanese games as well there are some great localisations the was fucking phenomenal
anime,removed,
anime,removed,sorry my bad all nsfw obviously
anime,removed,
anime,removed,ok this idea this idea for a video has been rummaging around in my head for a few days after i finally caught up with rezero make a groundhog day parody out of the show by montaging every time subaru dies but after ever death cut to him waking up in bed with sonny and chers i got you babe playing in the background i know its kind of a stupid idea fully expecting to get a few downvotes but wanted to try and share this since ill probably never make it since im currently fighting a losing battle with the being know as procrastination
anime,removed,i think you mispelled ram since there is not such thing as rem
anime,removed,hmmm maybe you are right but i reread negima a few weeks ago and i dont remember anything about them apart from the date with negi kotaro and fate and im sure i only remember it because it happens in the of volumes but what ai dont need to reread it to remember when negi goes to the twins to see the campus and they go to the world tree i mean i dont like them specially but if i made a list with my favs negima girls the twins would be just above the cheerleaders now that i think about it i dont know where i would put hakase in that list
anime,removed,i totally agree ubw wasnt perfect by any means necessary but the fan service was fantastic if you were a fate fan to begin with shirou vs gil had me fanboying hard
anime,removed,whos that blue haired girl is she a new character or something
anime,removed,yeah apparently s subaru dies multiple times is considered a spoiler
anime,removed,latest finished rich boys harem ouran
anime,removed,sfate kaleid
anime,removed,kizumonogatari
anime,removed,s kizumonogatari
anime,removed,last one i watched human vs rats watashitachi wa ningen daaaaaaaaaaah
anime,removed,gurren lagann i bet
anime,removed,i was thinking of yuru yuri but i forget that show got real protagonist
anime,removed,railgun
anime,removed,speed bump animated
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,apparently priscillas knight is also from the same world as subaru this was supposed to be revealed around the same time as episode or so so i definitely think that it will become relevant eventually you notice this when subaru comments on how anastasia is using a kanto accent or something and priscillas knight responds like i heard theyre all talking like that from where anastasia is from refering to the kanto accent which means the he recognises what it is
anime,removed,this anime adaptation is inspired by the events in france earlier this month
anime,removed,interested to see which studio animates this series looking forward to the s singing parts at least
anime,removed,what please dont i love truck
anime,removed,but that still is not a spoiler you said yourself you havent caught up with the show but you think you have a clue about what i said in no way is that a spoiler thats like saying man subaru fucked up and saying its a spoiler because you think he fucking murdered everyone when that obviously was just made up in your head someone who hasnt seen the full anime wouldve thought that i was an idiot who wasnt paying attention like i thought when i saw a post on another forum a few weeks ago all i said was i never seen rem before and is she a new character which is basically an inside joke if anything you are the one who spoiled it by marking it as a spoiler interpretation is just that interpretation if you say an anime is sad it can mean alot of things like my post yet it never will get spoiler tagged even though sadness can be through death heartbreak defeat you name it not a spoiler even if you think its one of those
anime,removed,katsura da
anime,removed,i dont understand how it impacts anything by simply asking who is that character there are a lot of characters so i could be asking who the character is because maybe i confused her with ram or something again stating the inside joke portion
anime,removed,whos rem seriously though who is the monsterish thing
anime,removed,people died i got bored le epic twist was completely obvious maybe ill finish it someday when i run out of shows i actually care about
anime,removed,im not saying my comment should get special treatment im saying how getting tagged for a spoiler and being threatened with a ban for absolutely nothing is saying subaru wears a tracksuit considered a spoiler too no you wouldnt remove my comment for that yet me asking who the character is decides a removal no it really doesnt i really dont give a crap what you say its still complete bullshit
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,i just told my friend i think shes in limbo like neither alive or dead
anime,removed,s best girl won
anime,removed,well i kind of regret watching this pretty much confirms hes going to die early in the episode and rem is going to come back it was not clear before that she hadnt somehow been entirely erased and the answer to that had been the primary thing i had been waiting on for the next episode im guessing the white whale only has the ability to erase the memories of people within the current iteration although i guess something crazy could happen next episode like rem being there but the memory erasure persisting
anime,removed,just finished this last night definitely a good anime to show to your siblings especially with that ending no harm done right
anime,removed,i remember in mayoi jiangshi shinobu asked for a head pet before she dies after seeing the movie i realized how significant it meant for both of them
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,fistfights a bear shows off ippos dick in public etc he is a man of many talents
anime,removed,she becomes a certified bad ass later on but i doubt this anime season will get to any of that since its only episodes
anime,removed,its great just for the conversation between subaru and rem there is no other reason its character development for subaru
anime,removed,dude need some answers in manga huge spoilers btw s yotari dies but does she come back i dont know the details about her death btw
anime,removed,hahahabe careful with your wish
anime,removed,someone help me understand what to expect from this all i know about is s rock band and something involving truckkun
anime,removed,fuck everyone here fuuka is not that bad as everyone here says it is the art is pretty good and the characters are actually decent theres quite a bit of unnecessary drama but thats like in the half of the show which probably wont even be animated i actually didnt mind truckkuns appearance in the manga and i actually thought it was one of seos best work chapters in its pretty bad afterwards but again it probably wont even be animated i actually thought fuuka would be a lot more successful as an anime we can actually listen to the songs now i for one cant wait for chapters to be animated
anime,removed,but she doesnt know shes god
anime,removed,plus not sure how ill watch anime in china ill still try to post in the rewatch dunno how thatll work out torrent download and phone
anime,removed,his explosive personality
anime,removed,btw you can expect yatori to go berserk everytime the life of an imperial family member is menaced her father teach her to be the blade of the empire she just cant go against the will of the imperial family because its how she is thats why she almost break iktas arm everytime he speak too bluntly to chamille
anime,removed,good thing she is iktas ally and not someone against him s for now d but youll probably see in the next episode what could make them ennemies
anime,removed,s i think he got it mixed up that isnt the reset point but there will be a reset point where everyones forgotten about rem however shes in a coma and isnt dead
anime,removed,s she dies
anime,removed,hes gonna be a lot cooler in the later arcs kinda like mr satan of dbz but fully aware although i doubt this season would reach that part
anime,removed,i think you are thinking of his grandfather jonathan joestar joseph is the protagonist for over half of the first season and is also a main character later on
anime,removed,honestly thats about every villain the one after that is a bunch of chuunibyou
anime,removed,weeb
anime,removed,psa typing who will get you lots of dislikes
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,i dont know who you are talking about but she must be best girl
anime,removed,die in a fire

anime,removed,why did you make rams hair so blue s
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,whos

anime,removed,she doesnt deserve more love she takes it from your bowels
anime,removed,there is nothing wrong with sexualizing minors anime proves this
anime,removed,lethal weapon ateam firefly kokoro connect hyouka s
anime,removed,errr so theres this hentai called euphoria

anime,removed,who
anime,removed,who is that blue haired girl
anime,removed,can you link me to that i found one in nyaa but thats not raw its subbed in different language
anime,removed,who is this
anime,removed,here is re zero episode reviewdiscussion make sure to comment like subscribe
anime,removed,no the one in the grave is best girl
anime,removed,s his presentation in the series is what makes him special we constantly hear only praise and respect for him from everyone connected to him even guts the sole character who knows griffith completely and the atrocities he committed in the eclipse still holds him to great respect to him no one is his equal no ones dream could possibly match the bonfire that is griffith and no one questions this because he is above everyone else beyond comprehension for the characters of the series at least we constantly hear from other characters how he is exceptional the hawk of light from this we get the most interesting part of griffith his ambiguity we only ever really see one act of griffith that can be seen as truly evil the rest of his actions are a mystery to us even more so is his end goal which we know he has but nothing about which is what makes him scary hes overly ambitious and willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to reach his dream but we dont know the scope or the cost of his goal that plus his ambiguous relationship with guts and his betrayal
anime,removed,is she an original character have mercy on me pls
anime,removed,she makes a return later i believe just not in this arc so we most likely wont be seeing her unless they make a season
anime,removed,i dont remember this rem from rezero
anime,removed,next episode is when the real after story should start and thats where this series starts to go above and beyond traditional romancesdramassoletc
anime,removed,httpiimgurcomvbrordipng
anime,removed,wait who is rem
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,scantily clad pictures of lolis to the front page with you
anime,removed,we have to take in count that subaru was already a little depressed and was bad with social skills before he gets summoned in the fantasy world add to that the stress of dying countless times what happens here is that subaru is screwed at a psychological level to deal with the stress of being in this new world he takes it as an mmo fantasy game and develops a protagonist syndrome he really thinks he is the hero of the history when nobody really needs him also he took emilia is a token of love and purpose tbh all what he has been doing is both to help others and give himself a purpose i think all of that makes him a great character breaking stereotypes he is not a good guy he is just a normal guy minor spoiler he doenst kill himself he remplaces emilia with rem
anime,removed,this contest has proven once and for all that ranime has shit taste

anime,removed,good jumping off point huh start of part which is episode should be good enough then part didnt work for most people due to being old but you can watch it to fill the gaps if you got time all you need to know is that theres this stone mask that makes people into vampires and jonathan fights with his nemesis who got the stone mask then jonathans grandson becomes the main character of part
anime,removed,this submission has been removed threads consisting of a direct question may be removed once a proper answer has been provided this is not a violation of subreddit rules its subreddit cleanup have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,removed,lets start the neverending back to the roots all the upcoming episodes will be awesome and bad for my heart
anime,removed,eps and were introduction of arc suffering begins this week rem
anime,removed,soo they crammed chapters worth of content totalling pages into a episode into the anime showed a character thats suppose to be introduced later on in the series at the same time leaving out why guts visited the bar in the first time introduced a new monster in the skeleton fight scene godamnit i just want a faithful adaption
anime,removed,for people who wants to find out what they skipped heres the first chapter nsfw they pretty much skipped over pages of the first chapter
anime,removed,notlikethis
anime,removed,oh my sweet summer child
anime,removed,not to mention dragonslayer looking so dull both in terms of interest and sharpness at this point in the story it actually is dull from all of the reckless monster slaying guts has been doing it gets resharpened later
anime,removed,its part of the lost children arc guts saves jill there
anime,removed,hell die so much that dying becomes a norm for him
anime,removed,hahahahaha hahahahaha oh boy youre cute
anime,removed,i looked up spoilers and dropped it halfway through the first episode i have a shipping problem
anime,removed,guts would have died countless times if it wasnt for pucks healing
anime,removed,puck has been comic relief but at least in early arcs hes more than that hes guts moral compass and sort of acts as a narratorpersonification of the audience hes an incredibly important character early on for the sake of story telling
anime,removed,rohan has a lovely house it would be a shame if it were to be burnt down you know
anime,removed,he fucked mom of his subordinate when he was or
anime,removed,it is described in the manga as being far too rough indeed it was like a heap of raw iron it rips and tears through things rather than cutting through them its supposed to be brutal and monstrous
anime,removed,there is some explanation later on about how theyd rectify it if someone was a creep
anime,removed,it was like that in the manga too some of those points will be explained later on
anime,removed,are horriblesubs on this
anime,removed,they put a demon semen into its fetus
anime,removed,
anime,removed,now you know how us gantz fans feel about that abortion of an anime they put out or the abortion that was mad bull or the abortion that was the fist of the north star series movie was bad ass tho or the abortion that was the legend of rikki oh shonensenien manga with fuck loads of graphic violence and tons of sex no matter how unpleasant get the hentai treatment usually its annoying because in the case of gantz for a purely specific example wouldve faired well with better animation and a more direct adaptation of the story it gets pretty god damn crazy after they kill the statues and everyone dies the first time
anime,removed,out of habit i checked the spoiler aw although that makes me a bit happy for my on a thread before
anime,removed,so are all the fate shows just different alternate timelines of the holy grail war like in s higurashi where rika kept being reborn over and over again so she could try to save everyone
anime,removed,besides the vampire shit i thought it was pretty cool
anime,removed,s dont exactly remember what i followed but this seems similar enough misae dorm lady tomoyo yukine ryou kyou kappei sunohara kotomi fuko toshio nagisa after story taken from
anime,removed,let the suffering begin i swear i want to stop watching the anime and consider the if chapter of the wn as a canon ending god the way shits going down in this arc is too painful to watch but the anime is too addicting
anime,removed,yep this si the first time araki really drops the ball with stand power creep im just glad he didnt get fugoed
anime,removed,the whole episode was like a mishmash if three different arcs i mean the only thing they actually did from the black swordsman arc was the stuff with the carriage they skipped right over the snake baron i mean he was the whole reason guts even went to that bar in the first place then the tree from lost children and now it seems like theyre jumping right into conviction arc i had hope that despite the cg it would at least be faithful to the source material but thats already not the case despite all that was i the only one who got really hype when blood and guts started playing almost saved the entire episode for me
anime,removed,hey i expect nothing less from a community full of people whos top tier anime features a year old girl in a talking bikini armor fighting her sister who is also in a bikini armor
anime,removed,alright so im late in getting to see this because my fridays arent free they might be in three weeks time but thats not assured i may not get to see the episode until hours after it comes out every time but i came and watched as soon as i could yeah like everyone else i am not thrilled it didnt come out great but i really cannot stand all the kill me i hate this industry i promise ill make a proper adaptation echo chambers let me be perfectly clear i have been reading berserk since i was after i watched the anime for the first time it blew my mind that the mature section of my public library had volumes of it so i could read it without having to search comic and video stores i used to stay in the reading room from when they closed just taking in all the beautiful art and the story sometimes ive lapsed sometimes i went months without reading any berserk but im no stranger to it the manga and the anime have been part of my entire adult life it makes me smile when i see people discovering how fucked up it is for the first time i like showing it to my friends this smells of bascognes doings turned into a joke between me and my buddies for a while after we loved that line when we watched the battle for doldry movie as soon as we were able our hands on it it is in no way lost on me how steep of a drop in decline of quality it is from kentaro miuras original manga to an episode of anime that was not very good i am not going to try and sell myself as the biggest berserk fan i still need to get caught up on the most recent chapters actually but all these comments talking like its completely hopeless utter shit or an insult to the manga i can not relate to even if i am also in the disappointed party do you guys know what this episode was most of this episode adapted chapter of berserk aside from parts of the opening parts of the tavern scene that was from chapter and the few seconds of aftercredits this episode was all just chapter can i get anyone to tell me who considers that their favorite chapter is the first volume anyones most fondly remembered part of berserk was the chapter that bridges guts going from his execution of the snake baron and onto going to war with the slug baron a strongly significant part of the story was there any huge developments in chapter of berserk okay it did show the dream sequence where guts is being chased by his mutated unborn son butwe get more of that later anyway and it is explained later as well it was mostly foreshadowing in this section what youre all complaining got ruined was the chapter where guts kills a bunch of skeletons after all of the other story developments that were still included in this episode thats pretty much it i am not unaware of the other problems yes the art does not nearly do miura justice but for christ sake i dont think people realize that berserk looking on screen like it does on page would not look anything like the one punch man it would not look like unlimited blade works would that be better sure would it be the right thing to get ufotable or madhouse to make berserk look like that stop fucking lying to me no it wouldnt be right no modern art style in anime is doing the berserk style closest i can think of was jojo i use the past tense because the diamond is unbreakable style is further removed from it but those very thick colors heavy character models and detailed frames that we got sometimes not all the time from jojo was the only thing thats come close to what the actual berserk art set to animation would look like so i realize were stuck with a full season of artwork that does not work well with the story thats being told it is not satan it is not evil it is unfitting it is bad because no one ever should have been trying to do berserk without years and years of preparation it is not bad because its cg cg could be right for berserk if it it was being done by the animators who did the work on godzilla for the couple of seconds in the move where the muto was rendered nearly perfectly if those folks meticulously made sure every frame was as well detailed and put together as those very short shots where their monsters almost didnt look like cgi so since that will never happen in any reality yeah of course i agree that a style of animation would be better but i have no patience for anyone trying to sell me on the idea that anyone other than someone like makoto shinkai has in recent years animated anything that could do berserk justice the problem is not jarring cg the problem is no television anime could have hoped to be right besides why are we all pretending to forget that the berserk anime also was not that well animated the adaptation of the golden age arc of berserk from the art looked wonderful in still frames it sparsely was actually moving in a way that did it justice and yet with that lackluster movement of the characters it was still fantastic we did a rewatch of it six months ago glass reflection reviewed it is that series suddenly not well liked despite not being the best to see in motion yeah yeah the cgi also looks kind of janky in still frames too big woop it also did look kind of nice at times too the point is being a constant visual delight isnt the only good thing about the berserk story and not delivering that does not instantly ruin it it didnt before and yes i know they just skipped the lost children arc that was my favorite arc i like that better than any time zodd shows up i like it better than the kusharn wars i love it more than i loved the golden age i dont care that most of my favorite characters were absentee for that arc it was fantastic and i could read and look at it forever theyre just skipping over my favorite part and yet somehow here i am thinking you all are overreacting when i did a quick search for the lost children arc of berserk one of the very top results i got was actually a post here on reddit asking if it was necessary i hope at least the people complaining about skipped pages are at least people like me who loved those and not people who were wondering if it needed to be in the manga even though it is my favorite the story can move on without it it would be a little hollow it would lack guts at his absolute darkest as well as my favorite character moment of him bonding with jill but his story can go on without it besides how do we even know it was cut entirely and not just going to be out of place what tells us that they arent going to either somehow work in farnese into the lost children part of the story or have guts get separated for it to happen the tower of conviction story probably cant last episodes on its own can it i dont have my hopes pinned on it but its possible they just spliced it rather than cut it out entirely but okay let me assume this does confirm guts war with rosine is completely cut out then after the tower of conviction we are going to see how they handle griffiths rebirth i am not particularly hyped but fuck you if you think they could possibly do so bad that i wouldnt still love the berserk manga and old anime or stop me from enjoying coming chapters
anime,removed,bruh you suck so much dick

anime,removed,erased orange and rezero they all revolve around very similar themes for example satoru from erased still continuously attempts to save kayo by timetraveling however hes also the person who relays the letters from naho from orange to her teenage self since he empathizes with her regret of preventing kakerus death just move oranges setting to the to align with eraseds setting of course trying to help naho only complicates satorus quest the suffering gets worse since like in rezero satoru can trigger his timetravel by dying then reviving which causes him to eventually lose his sanity as he slowly breaks himself by continuously sacrificing himself and building up a whiteknight complex basically its a fun anime that the whole family can enjoy a title would be tough though erased from zero maybe or orange juice since satoru keeps on being beaten to a pulp

anime,removed,hey im looking for some anime to relax between the days and to entertain myself maybe something light hearted slice of life involving moeblobs doing excessively cute things except they are not dying in the process like madoka magica something that hit close to home make you face the truth of the world or something and preferably with somebody like hachiman thanks in advance
anime,removed,s he was subconsciously moving becoming closer and closer to his reincarnation its still a shit excuse but its legit
anime,removed,context is everything we have yet to find life anywhere else which brings up the fermi paradox as far as we know these billions of lives might be the only in the universe so yes it is a big deal you are actually autistic if you have that little empathy either that or an edgelord or maybe just suffering from depression regardless you dont seem to be quite alright either
anime,removed,my classic answer here is suzaku from code geass suzakus philosophy of trying to fix a system peacefully from the inside is in my view a lot better than a philosophy of fixing a system via an armed terrorist rebellion his approach largely could have worked having one of the knights of the round be an eleven would have probably given suzaku a lot more power over how japan was run and would generally have improved the perception of elevens as a whole we actually see a number of peaceful solutions that almost work and largely they fail because a certain masked crusader for justice has an ongoing terrorist campaign that keeps muddying up the works i think a large part of why hes hated really is that his actions are inconvenient to lelouche as someone pointed with regard to rossiu from ttgl characters tend to get hated when they come into conflict with the main character even if that characters motivations make sense from their perspective the word hypocrite inevitably gets applied to suzaku but ive never understood it you might not like suzakus ethics and philosophy but he pretty consistently applies them throughout the series yes hes not entirely pure in his motives s between his death wish and his anger over euphemias death but his actions still remain consistent with his ideals as opposed to someone who makes large showy speeches about justice while doing things like deliberately killing allies for tactical advantage

anime,removed,i posted this in a nonanime thread a while back and it got some attention so this is a good time to repost not spoilered because i dont think theres anything too big in here i always felt so bad for him his mother died in front of him although he doesnt consciously remember it his father abandoned him and erased all traces of his mother he spends his childhood just having a place to crash but no real family or connections with anyone then suddenly his father shows up and says risk your life to pilot this robot even though you have no training or anything by the way the world will be destroyed if you fail and then when he does not only does no one even act the least bit thankful hes bullied for it and then when he has the gall to say you know this kinda sucks and i dont wanna do it anymore all of the characters in the show and even the fans just answer shut up and get in the damn robot actually now that i think about it the fans response to shinjis whining is kind of brilliant in a way hes a teenage boy with legitimate issues and every time he cries out for help all anyone says is oh stop whining look how good you have it you get to pilot a giant robot just like people often do with real depressed teenagers well minus the giant robot

anime,removed,im also guessing we wont see that scene in vol if you are talking about the incest scene then it is completely unnecessary as they only did it because there was no one else to do it with oh and there is no way well cover vol with just two episodes left x
anime,removed,ive got a large extended family and only my grandfather lost his memories for about months prior to passing on ive dealt with way too many deaths mostly natural to count the experience of visiting with my grandpa him not being able to remember anyone in his large and close family even my grandma that experience was extremely rough and different than any type of death to me it didnt hit me as hard as it hit kazu but its been about years since he passed and i still think it was the heaviest weighing experience and the family members illness and then death that really features in my mind something that i cant console myself over or rationalize in the slightest it just remains as long torturous and extremely painful reminder of life and death

anime,removed,erased works for marketing but i like the japanese title better it directly references the the poem kayo wrote as a little girl which makes it more meaningful her poem is the town where only i exist if i remember right referencing the fact that she believes she can be happy if she is able to escape the title of the show plays off of that referencing the fact that s she and the other children of the town are only able to survive and be happy if satoru goes into the coma and erases himself from that town both titles work and you can make the connection but i think the japanese title make it more apparent plus i like the sound of the town where only i am missing

anime,removed,oh sorry if i worded it wrong i personally liked the pain arc but i think the reason people didnt like it is because the ending was poorly written it ended with naruto talking pain into submission and pain bringing everyone back to life which made everything that happened before it feel pointless as for the great war arc i feel like naruto became way too strong seriously i dont know how many new abilities and moves he learned in that small time frame and also made every other characters feel unimportant this is all my personal opinion though

anime,removed,i really dont think so because you can track engagement its a meaningful statistic but seriously its usually so few shows that arent in europe seems petty and entitled to me to skip cr because of that i really enjoy simulcasts and i dont miss fansub times so ill support cr for now since i think its pretty cheap also the app for my tv and phone is nice the alternative isnt a competing service its piracy youre not showing them anything because youre not showing up in their data except maybe as a random number on a torrent somewhere which cant show region and such anyway so yeah ill keep paying cr and pirate some stuff im fine with that only you can decide for yourself i dont particularly care either way but for myself i decided to become a positive statistic instead of a negative one

anime,removed,having read the first four books of the series before bakatsuki was gutted i feel like sagiris actually one of the less bad things about it that is at least for you and your irrational hatred of the angel that is kirino kousaka she lacks kirinos physical aggression what with the muscle weakness and all and is actually much nicer to the mc if anything shes more passive aggressive but even then its much milder than what kirino puts kyousuke through i think the thing to be more troubled by is s the fact that it dispenses with the effort the author put into developing relationships between the mc and the female cast and is essentially just a harem with the sister playing the lead role

anime,removed,ok so talking about a video creator and his relationship to a sub is not cool gotcha
anime,removed,wtf were you even thinking posting this sub quality meme on one of my favorite anime forums ill have you know that by the time i was i had already finished naruto bleach every dragonball series as well as countless other quality anime i even had the best limited edition figurines that my parents money could buy from real series such as deathnote and the tmnturtles vintage edition of raph dont even get me started on your anime experience look im not trying to be overly rude or anything ill always encourage people trying to get into anime and i am usually quite the patient and understanding man i honestly try to relate and befriend people such as yourself on most occasions for at least a month or however long it takes for me to deem them worthy or unworthy of the sweet blessing that is anime but this this is unacceptable and downright offensive to my culture and everything i stand for as a devout anime viewer and manga reader ill return to this topic in a bit dont worry you think you know anime you think youre a real fan never in my entire years of living have i ever seen something more pathetic than this honestly with posts like this i can surmise that your character is nothing more that of my parents or old friends who just couldnt accept me for who i am ive known your type ever since the fourth grade when my heart was destroyed by the girl who was actually totally into me that was of course until i showed her my storage closet full of only the highest quality clippings of my shōnen✩jump collection youre just a shallow shallow man just like haretchichan of my own independently produced manga not that i expect you to have even the slightest clue what im talking about this an advanced and highly evolved form of entertainment and if you can not appreciate it as such then i have no interest in your contributions to this forum sir now lets take a look at the animaiecal achievements of a true civilized animation enjoying youth ive recently completed my anime this probably doesnt seem like a significant number however asking any intelligent viewer such as myself would yield you the response that it is the total number of naruto shippuden episodes one of the greatest series to be released additionally i own a limited edition beach towel of the edition semiholographic rerelease of the dark magician girl i have also saved up enough of my allowance to purchase a full sized pillow displaying a custom image shinobu eishimasan from bleach in case you werent familiar now i bet i already know your uneducated opinion on manga before i even ask you think why would i want to bother reading some silly comic about a show when i could just watch it hahahaha you have no idea how wrong you even are first of all manga isnt based on the show the show is based on the anime secondly the manga is written by the authors the anime is simply based on the show later and they have liberties that truly make certain anime unteachable to me the point is that manga is the original creation i dont want to posting stuff from anime of which you havent even read the manga first meaning you couldnt even begin to understand the intricacies of characters or the complexities of the situation at hand i hope you see where im coming from now and i hope you arent hurt too bad its just that seeing such a meme on one of my favorite forums for my favorite topic is unbearably painful so please feel free to come back just make sure that you watch some real anime first make sure you are willing to invest and devote yourself to anime not just looking to get a cheap laugh out of some silly uninspired meme come back when youve won a few barnes and noble official regional youth tournaments using an exact replica of solomon mutos deck maybe i will one day look forward to your submissions but given your current experience with the artform i wont hold my breath good luck and i hope you live a happy life i truly dont think negatively of you as a person just please do not bring this anime garbage to me again until you mature and youre capable of understanding the complex yet beautiful nature of anime thank you for your time and i hope you dont think of me as the bad guy im just looking out for newcomers and i dont want them to think that this kind of content is all the community has to offer

anime,removed,same i watched it about a year ago and while i really liked it i felt like the weight he was talking about in the video just didnt register oddly though i still feel my chest get heavy or even my throat clutch occasionally when i see clips of some of those heavier scenes spikes death especially and every time i see an analysis video on the show or even small clips from it i feel the need to rewatch it
anime,removed,niggers and jews
anime,removed,its very weird cause i downloaded the first two albums which is much bigger without any problems a torrent link would be amazing though thank you very much
anime,removed,i didnt like it period i personally didnt think much of the ost especially when compared to the god tier ost that zero had but thats besides the point my complaints as i remember were this there was too much melodramatic philosophical wishwash near the end even in this remake i still found shirou lackingand most of the rest of the castas a character too many plot conviniences and ultimately kotomine kireis death the way that they handled kireis end made me want to drop it right at that point in the anime it was justsuch a lazy and boring way to end off a character who was so intriguing in fate zero they ruined the kotomine kirei i had enjoyed as a character and played him off as the typical shonen psycho villian i get that im making a lot of general complaints but it has been a while since i watched it and those were the thoughts on it that i remember it was just overall very underwhelming with many of the plot points and characters being particularly irritating ill give it credit to its incredible animation and fighting sequences but you cant run a show off of those alone
anime,removed,the bullshit in akame ga kill is that the author could not be more obvious who they are going to kill next when past revealed other than tatsumi they ded i went to the manga but flashback talking alone with tatsumi about their dream or past or something dead i had enough of deaths that i went to watch a few known shitty anime to get it off my head the deaths didnt make me cry they made me go like oi what the fuck

anime,removed,i need someone to sell me clannad everytime i try to progress in the anime i ultimately drop it i watched the first episodes probably but i dont enjoy it yet maybe i should try to hold on and it will get better later i find characters bland nothing happen in the story and i really dont like the design the character i find the most interesting is sunohara but hes mostly used as a comic relief so its boring fast the mystical aspect has been merely touched upon so maybe i will be more interested once it gets more present s i didnt like fuko as a character so i didnt really feel anything when they started to forget about her the character was really unidimensional almost autistic maybe she was and i didnt really grasp everything about her character
anime,removed,watching an anime with ecchi or harem tags and then dropping it due to fanservice shows you must be autistic or just weird i only really watch anime with ecchi harem and comedy and only drop ones that are boring i dont drop them because of the fanservice because what sense does that make you more than likely new it would have it so you dropped it because of that ok then

anime,removed,not sure if this counts but the tone of the last episode of inoubattle wa nichijoukei no naka de felt completely different from the rest of the series the only real serious fight scene in the show s a well thought out strategy which starts with a one sided fight of the mc taking a couple of harsh blows followed by him bluffing to get the enemy to steal his power which causes self harm to its user followed by a flashback of the mc using his power for the first time and the decision his friends had to make on the spur of the moment to save him he gets the enemy to leave his classmates body which was being possessed at the time so now we have this girl who as soon as she gets back to her senses is causing self harm to her own body without knowing whats going on then that same choice they made before has to be done again in order to save the both of them some of the girls start crying and oh man the rest of the episode i was like
anime,removed,its manga had more content ive done some research obviously you havent done enough research yes the manga has more content but no the manga hasnt even caught up with the anime yet its only on the final fight so far the one against the emperor mecha also after both tatsumi and akame died i doubt the manga andor the anime will continue they might adapt akame ga kill zero though
anime,removed,i agree season was boring but if you do some research on the second light novel for phantom world it seems way darker then the first light novel we see an adult haruhiko fight in a war against phantoms unable to kill the phantom rupa she goes on to eradicate twothirds of the human population whats left of humanity lives in the underground city of gehenna haruhiko blames himself for the apocalypse with mai reina koito and others as his mental supports as his friends fall one by one haruhiko swears that even if he gives his soul to the devil he will eradicate the phantoms as he is swallowed by the darkness of revenge haruhiko rises to use a forbidden ability in hopes to finally end the struggle

anime,removed,for those of you who who dont think that dio is a better villain than gilgamesh let me remind you that he is responsible in part for some major events or even entire parts warning unmarked spoilers while most people think that dio is only relevant in parts and his actions go much further part because of dio keicho nijimura gained the stand arrow from is father in order to find a stand to kill him which lead to akira stealing it and making more stand users at his whim which ultimately leads to the discovery of yoshikage kira part he gave birth to the protagonist part his followers continued his work to achieve heaven which leads to the death of both jotaro and jolyne not to mention ending that version of the universe and bringing way for part

anime,removed,i didnt ask you to speak wretch
anime,removed,even if they didnt actually leave anything major out s yeah there were backstories and more development for some of the other characters like alice from episode in the manga which were just left out here its definitely lost some of the magic it had in season
anime,removed,ive been watching the heroic legend of arslan up to the part where s magic is introduced and pretty much just stopped dead in my tracks there i loved how it portrayed everything in a realistic manner and felt this was just going to be the bane of the series am i being unreasonable how much of an impact does s magic n wizards n dark spells have on the rest of the series is it shoehorned in at every given time essentially turning into an entirely different series or is it downplayed and rarely used wasnt sure where else to ask this didnt want to create a thread
anime,removed,dont use those illegal streaming sites you are better off torrenting unless your isp throttles torrent connections at least then the ass holes that run those sites wont be making any money off ads plus torrents will have higher quality video anyway
anime,removed,oh thats curious but seeing as hes kind of an immortal beast i guess that makes sense haha thanks
anime,removed,
anime,removed,if you dont mind illegal
anime,removed,but he loves emilia
anime,removed,nope its basically just the two of them people in flashbacks and the s fiddler crab the movie is going to have other characters though
anime,removed,of course its better technically he was making a joke but youll learn over the rest of the series that return to death is anything but a blessing its a tragedy
anime,removed,im not sure how long its gonna take mods to delete my comment but it starts with k ends with e and has issanimem somehwere in the middle
anime,removed,youll find out all about that soon
anime,removed,i cant access netflix where i live and since ive already downloaded the raws from nyaa may as well watch em
anime,removed,s well in the first season suman dark bit through allens hand that was pretty graphic
anime,removed,danganronpa was just a blast they killed best girl after best girl first it was mahiru then they got peko then they got mikan then they got ibuki and finally for the nail in the coffin they got motherfuckin chiaki
anime,removed,httpmyanimelistnetprofilebaryonyx any recommendations for a more cynical take on battle shonens something like hunterxhunter where idealism breaks down and the protagonist is morally wrong
anime,removed,the rape the other rape the other other rape the fact that the bad guy only tries rape asuna as a power play over kirito like she isnt even a factor in her own sexual assault thats a new level of disgusting the fact that kirito leads on every girl he meets and it seen as virtuous lots of things
anime,removed,oh man chiakis still chiaki had a heart attack during with her meeting with hajime its so sad that class would become despairs breaks my heart i have a question though spoiler then what chisa said would it end up in a bad end who knows ill just hold on to that and spoiler
anime,removed,he is too nice to subaru because he has a blessing that blessing is being friendly to anyone except if its an enemy and no spoilers here but reinhard wont be an enemy
anime,removed,well in the manga nagai and the other dude join forces with tosaki to bring satou down in the tv anime nagai and tosaki went their separate ways
anime,removed,well in the manga nagai and the other dude join forces with tosaki to bring satou down in the tv anime nagai and tosaki went their separate ways after a fight
anime,removed,im becoming more and more worried by this subreddit why do people think that females who kill the main character are best girl asakura elsa rezero and rem
anime,removed,if you want to set sail i can send you a link in pm
anime,removed,evangelion vs mp evas
anime,removed,i know that is what the author is going for however that doesnt make me any more invested or entertained by the show it just makes me less invested if none of the character are empathetic or interesting
anime,removed,while technically yes kyubey is very careful with his words and never says a outright lie the way he manipulates is almost like lying for example when sayoka was turned into a witch and kyoskey asked if there is any way to change her back kyubey said that if there is a way he isnt aware of it while yes technically that isnt a outright lie it is a lie in the sense that kyubey knew that it was impossible but made it seem like there might be possible way to do it
anime,removed,extra points because childhood friend won d
anime,removed,have you actually read my comment or is it actually possible to be this ignorant also spoiler tag
anime,removed,good news then
anime,removed,a jojo threw a hissy fit about dp cutting micky mouse and the eye popping scene other than that schrodringer censor i still cant believe is going to happen next week its happening
anime,removed,starting next week almost every episode is going to be main plot and im pumped for best girl and s best villain
anime,removed,hes coming next week i dont think ive been more excited for an episode of jojo
anime,removed,anime readers are in for a treat next episode
anime,removed,you mean after what you did after all those you betrayed you dont feel anything
anime,removed,the internal story is filler but the character development is enormous it shows off the difference between sdc and diu jotaro sdc jotaro would have been like josuke this ratt tried to shoot me that pisses me off oraoraoraora diu and so jotaro are much more methodical stop survey the area pick up on minor details form a battle plan carry out that plan with precision and balls of steel
anime,removed,a message for non ln readers yes after this episode there will be school arc but this school will end in or episodes maxdepends on adaption pace and this school arc is not for adding harem lol so dont worry
anime,removed,reinhard isnt there so hes got no choice
anime,removed,read the manga unless the anime changes it there is relationship building but little romance if that makes sense
anime,removed,gekkan shoujo nozakikun funniest anime of the decade
anime,removed,is this guy a legit demigod who are his parents
anime,removed,the show i know it from is
anime,removed,ahahah aha hahah i cant wait to see peoples reactions over the ending
anime,removed,if this is all true is he there just for the purpose to make subaru look like shit in comparison reading all this is sufferu in itself

anime,removed,i hate saber she is almost completely s king arthur in a dress with no real change in backstory or anything its really lazy to me as someone who loved the history of the kings of britain as a kid
anime,removed,the manga for naruto is done he and naruto are essentially brothers without the actual blood relation
anime,removed,fuck off
anime,removed,or push the fact of him not using both sides of his body
anime,removed,one could argue s rank hero king just got there by accident
anime,removed,my favourite villain in anime is kirigaya kazuto he is a true villain
anime,removed,hes a pretty good god though
anime,removed,please add a very nsfw warning to that source link
anime,removed,emiya shirou by far tells kiritsugu that he will become a hero of justice that saves everyone epically fails in every route abandoning his job to save a single heroine whose existence pretty much dooms the world participating in a murder fest and being at least partially responsible for a lot of deaths mass murdering countless people in a crazed utilitarian spree as he grows up and even after death finally realizes that hes so bad at his job that he decides his only hope is to go back in time repeatedly trying to find and murder his past self to cause a time paradox granted being a hero of justice is one of the hardest jobs in the world but hes a dense harem mc pretty much every other dense harem mc is a hero of justice that saves everyone so why you so fail at it shirou
anime,removed,the microwave that sends messages back in time and the headset that sends people back in time
anime,removed,end of eva spoilers i remember watching eoe and when i was done someone told me that the scene when asuka takes that lance to the face actually symbolises her sexual immaturity also hinted by her conversations with kaji and shinjilance kinda has a phalic figure and all the white angels thingies ganging up on her symbolises rape and eating her mechs body didnt help at all jesus christ thats some messed up shit i feel so bad for her like fuck dude really
anime,removed,thats the thing though kyon doesnt want to live a normal life hes an unreliable narrator through and through no matter what he says outloud he would rather have his crazy new life with haruhi aliens time travelers and espers than go back to the boring and mundane that becomes abundantly clear during his monologue in disappearance when he outright chooses his new life over returning to his old one admitting to himself that he fights this new life so much more fun than before
anime,removed,just watch the entire series the twist at the end is worth the wait
anime,removed,
anime,removed,as long as they they decide not to kill off even more best girls im good
anime,removed,fuck off
anime,removed,
anime,removed,wait what so they already confirmed he somehow survives daaaaamn i am bummed i love the ending to code geass
anime,removed,but the ending didnt make sense since lulu had a code and double geass the writers and director said he was completely dead as the price for his crimes
anime,removed,go outside you little freak ps theres real tits there lol
anime,removed,whos that jokes incoming
anime,removed,i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about kanbaru u wouldnt say this shit to him at lan hes jacked not only that but he wears the freshest clothes eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes yall are pathetic lol lol
anime,removed,rezero isnt as good as ranime thinks
anime,removed,
anime,removed,tldr you can like rezero but it has many obvious flaws that people arent addressing
anime,removed,friendly reminder that rezero is an anime that comes from a gigantic web novel i just have the sensation that people are obsessed in being infodumped at the start of the story if we dont know anything from his family yet is because the story doesnt want yet to tell us about it same about why subaru is so attached to emilia from the start maybe there is a motive explained later on first of all he never tries to find a way to explain his power to other people you havent watched the last episode didnt you and if that doesnt work why doesnt he say he can see the future do you think people would believe him everyone just takes him like if he was an idiot he doesnt even understand that every single situation can be solved with suicide why is subaru ever upset about any character deaths when no consequences are ever permanent because he can time travel take a knife try to stab yourself go just do it dying probably doesnt hurt at all its obvious that he doesnt want to suicide that is terrifying also maybe because were just watchers we can just think like duh just suicide and repeat does he really know how many lifes has maybe if he dies lets say more times its game over does he know that hell no he doesnt also they keep saying that the smell subaru has increases every time he dies that might have inmense consequences later on the story dying might be causing a lot of issues for him later on why do rem and ram have such a strong connection what the hell was episode to you they got the backstory explained there why do subaru and the maids care about each other so much remember that at the start everyone actually doubted of subaru and rem and ram only kept interacting with him for orders of emiliarosswald later on subaru finally figures out what to do and helps them defeat the mabeasts to save the whole town and their lifes so its normal that they start appreciating him even more clear from subarus perspective that due to the time loops he knows a lot more about both twins and how they really are
anime,removed,whos the bluehaired girl
anime,removed,ram who is this
anime,removed,twins what other girl
anime,removed,cant wait for rape tree

anime,removed,ok thanks for letting me know im new to reddit so i dont know much
anime,removed,pretty much the entirety of madoka i knew the twist coming in and everyone said it was heartbreaking but i was just bored most of the time and rooted for kyubey the only time i cared about any character was sakura
anime,removed,that scene in kiznaiver where theyre all crying on the field that felt like it was trying to get way more emotion out of me than i was capable of giving i felt the same way a few times in your lie in april but i liked that one a lot more

anime,removed,when shirley dies in code geass
anime,removed,it was when kamina from ttgl died didnt feel anything tbh
anime,removed,jirayas death seems to have hurt a lot of my friends when they watched it on the other hand i watched it with a straight face
anime,removed,not even episode on mobile so im being vague to avoid spoilers the realization of what that character was doing and why just man
anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,that dude from prison school who shit his pants in front of everyone so he could have a chance a chance its not even certain at acquiring some figurines
anime,removed,s at start for sure he is brave dude going in to save emi knowing after learning whats going on or when talking with elsa or even staying at cliff to protect ppl in mansion but after forest arc things go downhill and theres no balls anymore just stupid desperation and bad understanding of situation
anime,removed,great way of running a discussion into the ground before it even starts by being very aggressive while revealing that you dont know much of the topic
anime,removed,i like shaft theyre animation isnt bad but j wouldnt say its the best i love the monogatari series and madoka but there are times when i think they just get lazy and take a picture of some back scenery and put a few filters and say look heres our backdrop for the next ep i love them but i get disappointed at them at times
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,how can you even judge rezero if youre not watching it frickin anticirclejerkers
anime,removed,if youve only seen the anime then you havent really seen the absolute madman in action its clever to watch him flick with a finger or something but youll feel a lot different when he duct tapes his shattered hand into the shape of a fist so he can throw another punch with one for all because hes already fucked up his arms so bad
anime,removed,gyro zeppeli
anime,removed,wait only stand users can see stands only subaru can see his hands subaru has a stand
anime,removed,wwwait holdup nagisas sick for months and has to repeat this is the darkest timeline clanned y u do dis oh just wait

anime,removed,i mean im not being super serious but this kind of shit is pretty gross
anime,removed,the last episode of season of knights of sidonia that terrifying penis creature blushing crying and pretending to be hoshijiro has scarred me for life not to mention the bullshit bathroom breast size comparison scene
anime,removed,who is that blue haired girl
anime,removed,suddenly female character is now a psycho and hated why
anime,removed,the only part i felt kinda meh was the part where rem attacks subaru or was that ram in the manga you could see the entire thing very clearly it was like a hole just opened in his body and at least a liter of blood had already come out in the minutes he got in the floor in the anime i couldnt really see anything i only saw his arm out and that was it mostly
anime,removed,who is that blue haired girl
anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,see im gonna rant a bit here light dxd spoilers ahead i had a huge problem with about half of highschool dxd born but especially episodes and see i can respect changing the narrative a bit in order to fit a lnmanga into an animebut within reason dxd born went too far with the change in the narrativeso much so that it seems like it might be difficult to reconvene with the narrative of the lns see in the lns issei was traumatized by raynare the fallen angel in the first few episodes killing him she was the first girl he had ever really cared aboutand she literally stabbed him through the heart thats why issei was always such on the fence with how the girls treated him and kind of rejected their advances he subconsciously was thinking they were teasing him or whatever so remember how it started in dxd new that rias was anxious that issei never called her rias but called her buchou basically prez as in presidentbut would call the other girls by their names issei respected her but also thought he didnt have a chance with her unless he got stronger and could prove himself so what happens in the lns is that the rift between rias and issei starts growing the other girls take note of this and talk to him this basically fixes the issue and rias and issei go on to become officially a couple and since rias is in first place shes fine with issei doing pretty much anything with the rest of his harem so theres no bullshit evil issei clone ntr shit theres no brainwashed rias in something similar to isseis balance breaker and theres certainly nothing with them literally forgetting everything at the end rant
anime,removed,the episode of rezero was absolutely amazing i will refrain from commenting any further given most have not watched it yet hopefully the show lengthens to at least or more episodes but not dragged on like one piece and i pray the show comes back asap
anime,removed,the fact that sento and kanie didnt make it past hachimaniroha is a crime from the recent past i will not forgive nor forget anytime soon
anime,removed,left is pack and the right is petelgeuse romaneecontikun
anime,removed,as some who only watched the anime s i was waiting for exactly that line
anime,removed,whos that blue haired girl next to subaru
anime,removed,off the top of my head the angel beats flashback to s otonashis actual death underground incredibly sad stuff especially when you thought he died instantly to begin with
anime,removed,well i dunno the thing is the shows already going pretty far and out there by giving a guy a magical death notebook thats already a leap to make the audience has to accept this outlandish premise but then the show goes even further and crazier by spoilerspoiler it feels like too much there was already so much you couldve done with the initial premise
anime,removed,the uchiha massacre
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,why cant we just accept it as a loss i feel got did something similar the author was too afraid of losing a very loved character so he brought him back through a cheap plot device now the show lost the seriousness of any death now that the audience knows but they can just be brought back
anime,removed,novelupdatescom bakatsuki for whatever you cant find on novelupdates

anime,removed,ohhh man euphoria i remember the human centipede part on that vn
anime,removed,you saw when he opened his mouth and credits rolled well there is when he says that he also likes rem but white fox decided to cut it in the happy note fucking trollss
anime,removed,i guess euphy incident commonly known for some autistic reasons as the joke would cause a pretty nice shitstorm
anime,removed,people would go hype as fuck about dbz raditz gokupiccolo fighting duo finding out about the saiyans goku dead piccolo training gohan training in the afterlife the impending arrival of the saiyans their arrival and the damage and finally goku turning up and the show down with vegeta all in the first episodes
anime,removed,rezero web novel spoilers at the end by goddamnit that would be so much better way to end the anime than what we actually got this kind of cliffhanger is what was fun about rezero and would be very fitting as final scene
anime,removed,i think we need more unpopular opinion threads
anime,removed,fate saber rin and sakura nge rei asuka and misato and for the ladies all four jojos
anime,removed,on a meta level i pity that he basically wasnt there in after story there couldve been done a bit with an adult sunohana in the story and if its jsut him and tomoya reminiscing about the old times
anime,removed,and the few things that dont well he can always re spawn and fix them anyway hehe can he though thats exactly the point of the cliffhanger people wanted to see
anime,removed,you fucking killedutyron now

anime,removed,kill mayuri fuck ruka marry kurisu then kill ruka fuck mayuri and marry kurisu okabe will time leap to save mayuri so i got to choose again and kurisu best waifu ever
anime,removed,a group of friends wich has different supernatural beings and one normal guy in it tries to manage a girls mood swings did i mention the girl is god and doesnt know it and aforementioned mood swings can alter reality and destroycreate universes

anime,removed,could never get into short hair rem i like this version of her better shame about how it ended for her

anime,removed,wish monogatari never existed you have to be some kind of special case of autist to think like that even if you hate show theres literally no reason to be a dick and wish it never existed
anime,removed,secondhand embarrassment is one of the worst things this world has to offer the best example i can think of recently is episode of rezero i wish i died instead of subaru during that episode
anime,removed,yeah sureeeeee reigen dosent do that
anime,removed,hahaha just you wait the trolling hasnt ended yet the real unmasking will happen in the next episode
anime,removed,in your defense he becomes the strongest psychic solely through association considering the fact that both mob and serizawa are under his employ
anime,removed,i feel you shes going to be quite a major supporting character if season adapt ln arc thou
anime,removed,mob psycho has been getting worse in my opinion i think its just getting repetitive same thing that happened to opm imo berserk is still a great watch despite its flaws a great adaptation of an arc that largely sets up for the following rewrite is pretty nonsensical and its only redeeming quality is kagari rem as a character has zero depth and no motivation other than her love for subaru shes like a yandere without murderous intent though shes stil pretty fucked in the head murdering someone just because he smells a certain way d grayman is one of the better shows of this season but i understand why not a lot of people are watching it alderamin is criminally underwatched it has a great cast of characters and good world building shokugekis stagiare arc is better than the election arc
anime,removed,i fucking lost it with elizabeth bananya probably the harder ive laughed this season close second is the end of the new game finale when nene appears with the gun

anime,removed,i loved watching it every week ripping on it for being shit in every aspect but now the dtory has my attention sonce the suspicion started about the adults i grew a lot more interested and enthusiastic about the show
anime,removed,oh ill field that hes actually recommending shows that generally arent well received by more critical viewers but have a good amount of plebnormie fans on his own mal he even rates elfen lied a and bloodc a and akame ga kill also gets a lot of vocal hate in particular those shows have elements that are often criticized as edgy so hes implying you have shit taste and will enjoy just seeing edgy stuff this thread specifically the top comment just shows in ranime you cant have actual unpopular opinions without being downvoted and insulted god forbid someone has honest negative opinions about masterpieces fullmetalsteinsbeboppass and likes naruto more
anime,removed,if i remember correctly mushoku tensei was also published on syosetu and its great completed and entirely fantranslated pick it up
anime,removed,could have sworn it was s ranimes taste
anime,removed,they are talking about something they could do run off together and leave it all behind but they dont end up doing it for reasons
anime,removed,after that final scene in episode i need more emt
anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,madoka magica steins gate and rezero all have the same kinda of travels back in time for trial and error kind of crazy awesome plot but i feel like they are all done in kinda the same exact way i like how rezero had some little plot twists in the middle of going back in time but still nothing bizarre i want to see a director of a show get really creative and make something that would just bend my mind over

anime,removed,berserk is about the main character guts on his mission to kill every apostle of the god hand and reach his once friend now demon god griffith and to return the mind of his comrade and love interest casca who was forever scarred from a traumatic event and resembles one who is mentally ill now it is extremely dark and fantastical and is truly amazing in every way the old anime and movies are very good but honestly the manga is a step above truly if you had to choose absolutely go manga but watch the movies afterwards
anime,removed,from kimikiss pure rouge its one of the best love confessions i have seen in anime its heartwarming simple yet at the same time really powerful

anime,removed,nope i can tell you youre wrong about nana youll be quite shocked at how nana dies though or you may just find it stupid
anime,removed,your guess is spot on
anime,removed,its nothing as trivial as that
anime,removed,why is she sketchy to you she is nothing but pure hearted and naive
anime,removed,i have to disagree with what you just said on your second statement even without zombie western we would eventually see how evil and twisted calamity mary truly is with the upcoming adaption since you read the ln you know what im talking of
anime,removed,i have to ask you why do you think magical girls will remain in the end
anime,removed,cowboy bebop spoiler when ed and ein leave the crew it was so shocking for me i didnt realize what was happening until the good bye painted by ed on the ship was shown

anime,removed,would have liked to see how it went if he fought super gon
anime,removed,aku no hana classroom scene zankyou no terror bike scene bakemonogatari half of ep
anime,removed,i was actually pretty disappointed by the ending because it went full battle shounen with the fight and everyone had really happy ending as if all the conflict never happened
anime,removed,is it weird that theres a lot of good scenes but hxh when gon turns into a black and white demon kind of encompasses all scary moments
anime,removed,the things is fmab played out like a down to earth adventure show until all of a sudden it turns into battle shounen at the very last also it ended as if the conflict did not happen because there were no visible bad consequences which comes along that kind of big civil war
anime,removed,i find that nothing is really happening right now i mean someones died but thats about it
anime,removed,madoka stands there and does nothing blue hair girl blindlessly accepts the contract which kinda annoys me and black hair vague girls says stuff putting the audience on a disturbing cliffhanger
anime,removed,legit sayaka is criticising everything about homura and the other witch that came to the town she feels like shes being a bitch
anime,removed,ok again magical girls are complaining about their souls and shit while not even considering it when becoming one its like no one in the anime can think about risks
anime,removed,but its like walking into a dark alley to get million dollars without thinking about the consequences what would happen if i go in there
anime,removed,
anime,removed,definitely katanagatari imo the ending was the worst part of the show
anime,removed,assuming youre talking about the last few scenes of the movie ill try to answer your question with my take on the movie going to start with some of my key theories on how their memories are affected so bear with me in the beginning s heres my take on what a lot of critics call a plot hole in this movie the fact that the mcs seem to conveniently forget certain details that would give away the fact that they are not in the same time space the whole idea of time memories and being lie in musubi hitoha mitsuhas grandmother explains this during the scene where they go visit their shrines location in the mountains s musubi is sort of a spiritual being that can be invoked by two people interacting it can be anything from sharing a drink exchanging fluids like when taki drank mitsuhas kuchikami sake etc musubi have great powers but at the same time isnt perfect so every time taki and mitsuha wake up after their respective dreams they dont have a perfect recollection of what they dreamt about s they begin keeping diaries to tell each other of their experiences while theyre switched and the critics like to point out they should have been able to remember everything based on the written evidence but i like to think that combined with your typical teenagers short memory span and selective interpretations many critical details that would have clued them into the time gap were lost s a quick note about the miyamizu family its said in the movie that the women of the miyamizu family seem to have the ability to switch places dream but for what reason my take on it is that the musubi god was working towards saving the townspeople of itomori from the comet that will destroy them years after the first disaster that created itomori lake however musubi have limited powers so it has to rely on the intuition and motivations of mitsuha and taki to save itomorimachi s when the switching of places ends after takis date with okuderasempai the switching ends and thus the memories start to fade in real life i think that we tend to start losing memories of details as time goes by and only remember what was most impressionable to us i believe that at this point musubi probably decided that it had done enough to set up the two to meet triggering takis trip to hida takayama and ulitimately the shrine in the mountains in order to meet mitsuha s after thing are set in motion for mitsuha to save the townspeople of itomori musubis job is done and the two are just left with the feeling for each other leading to the last few scenes so given all of the above my answer to your question finally is that mitsuha probably forgot all of the details much like taki did but the memories are still there in her subconscious those memories may never be pulled out again but perhaps they will appear in their dreams now that theyve met the person they were looking for as to your second question no the novel does not cover the story after they meet each other in the end the novel was written after the movies story was written so its basically the exact same story theres another book called kimi no na wa another side earthbound written by arata katou but theyre short stories written from the viewpoints of taki yotsuha and mitsuhas father its a must read for the movie fan especially mitsuhas fathers side that said that book doesnt go into the lives of taki and mitsuha after they meet thanks for reading this long post ive been wanting to write something like it but didnt have the time nor opportunity to do so cant wait to watch the movie again i saw it four times during my last trip to japan
anime,removed,we are returning to fuka together right you just seal the deal mate were just lucky that theres no truckkun 🚚 in this anime

anime,removed,yeah im just going to keep copypasting this until you decide to answer it httpgundamwikiacomwikiamidaarca so she would be holding someone elses baby so this wouldnt count as lafter having a child either since shes also holding someone elses child since we already established that the people holding babies do not equate to the ones who gave birth to them
anime,removed,i know i havent watched one piece in a while and im in the middle of rewatching it so my memory may be a bit foggy so correct me if im wrong s but i guess part of my problem with calling that a plot twist would lie in the fact that i dont consider ace to be a protagonist even if i did consider him to be one i still wouldnt call it a plot twist but would be a bit more lenient in this discussion he was one maybe during the ace luffy sabo arc but other than that the focus was never on him i would say hes a side character a very important side character but side nonetheless the entirety of the straw hat crew are all protagonists and vivi could be considered during alabasta

anime,removed,make sure you vote for lordgenome guys and its not like he can lose hell just hus way to victory and why is s the armored titan here if s annie is allowed am i missing something
anime,removed,its just not as good as its godawful fans claim it is the current trend of downvote every minutes that i have is the proof of that people assert dumb statements in order to correlate rezero to a mature psychology and deep anime with time travels when in fact the only thing that holds water in the entire show is the cast of female characters the main character is the dumbest kind of excuse as a character as he is build up with a background written in order to allow these teenage kids to relate themselves to the main character so that they can enjoy the escapism the entire premise that the main character is a shutin and neet doesnt even hold moisture in the air let alone water as immediately you can notice that subaru is absolutely comfortable with speaking with people and interacting with people to the point that he can just so easily befriend emilia like any other normal person in which a shutin with social skills wouldnt do that this is coming from an actual shutin then we move onto the next premise his unexplained time travel poweraka the reset the main character is somehow able to restart the sequence of events and attempt to change the outcome through unexplained means this can actually be an interesting premise to explore but the author is either lazy or he doesnt have a proper idea on exploring this premise immediately the moment we see subaru restarts the day after he dies he acts in confusion this is actually not a bad thing because given any person would be confused if they reencounter the same events after he consciously know that he died then we see more development where he reencounters the girl he met and called her only to be even more confused when she acts hostile to him because he referred to her with an antagonists name so far so good the development because now he has a new conflict which he has to solve but the author again in pure laziness decides to solve that conflict by making subaru go through a silly death where he goes to insult the same thieves which were hostile to him originally even after they armed themselves if that is not clearly the author trying to avoid resolving the conflict i dont know man that is clearly the laziest level of conflict resolution then moving onto the next part in the third loop subaru manage to recruit some sort of omnipotent godlike hero to aid him to resolve the main conflict of the first arc not that its bad but the way it was carried out is also downright silly subaru did absolutely nothing to convince that guy to appear but he appears to save the day in the end anyway he literally went maybe you can show up at this place never mind okay maybe if you lower your standards this isnt really a bad show as it can easily store a decent or when you compare it to other shows so far lets move onto the next arc now shall we immediately in the second arc all the character introduction that was done in the first arc was basically thrown out of the window and we might as well be reading a new book like literally with new titles and new characters what happened to felt and rom forget them hi here is a twin loli maid which speaks in unison a drill hair blonde loli and a weird clown guy if your fetish is weird the fact that the fans go out their way to actually claim the sisters to be a well written and well developed character in the second arc blows my mind all that has happened in the second arc can be summed with this girl who loves her sister more than anything in the world decides that a guy she has just met days ago should d her im more than insulted when people use them as an example of a very well written sibling character just because they literally have the elder sister feels she should protect the the younger while the younger feels she should work harder to be like the elder if they want to mention actual sibling development watch space brothers or something that is actual development after the very long excruciating and boring second arc i had dropped the series and decided that maybe ill just run through it once its finished airing when i have time then episode happened where literally everywhere including reddit has like different threads on the frontpage praising it because of how deep it went i decided to take a look and buy was i disappointed what basically had taken place in episode is that the main character was forced to witness one of the twins getting brutally tortured in grotesque way thats all then he has a reset people were praising it for being a very good way of showing psychological trauma which i always just bring up this question why the fuck is the main character so stupidly affected by everything even when he clearly knows that he is able to reset time and prevent certain events from taking place in the entire series subaru is clearly aware that he can easily reset the sequence of event and try to stop it from taking place and he is especially aware that he cannot be killed then all these subjected the main character through so many different physical torture is just so stupid imo because he of all person should not be the one to fear physical damages only that he conveniently embraces his death in order to move the plot ie rescue the blue hairded loli maid before she dies where in other instances fuck no i dont wanna die mommy save me then as of writing this it brings up another question what the fuck is the character development of his its been episodes and he still acts autistic and literally the same way after dying tens of times doesnt that changes his outlook of life if i were to die multiple times and actually be aware of the what my death brings that itself will change my outlook on life itself i will definitely not look at my own life the same way hes acting as if hes a yolo dude but at the same time he is clearly aware that he does not yolo that is such a stupid contradiction tldr the fans overblown the show for what it is could get a or for visuals and execution gets a because of a stupidly developed plot which everyone praises for some reason its like the cringe when people say twilight has a good plot
anime,removed,i never said you did one person cant give a dagger anyway haha do you even know what im talking about

anime,removed,the pay off moment when all the build up finally comes to a close and proove watching the series was worth it ex gon vs hisoka goku turning super sayian luffys gatling against lucci the sand trio showing up or naruto vs pain
anime,removed,nias death and the shitshow is something no one has a problem with it shows that antispiral was right and simons quest was fruitless in the end spiral menace will still happen and simon couldnt save the one person he wanted
anime,removed,huh one of the bullets said that like subaru al is normal person that was summoned from another world but now its missing
anime,removed,shinsekai yori the hospital i dont want to say more to not spoil anything since theres a rewatch going on
anime,removed,well she killed the protagonist once and tortured him to the point that he had to be mercykilled the second time so
anime,removed,well puck is strong but a does state rienhard is basically the strongest in the series at pg i will acknowledge the possibility the qa may be wrong as i cant read japanese to cross check it with the source
anime,removed,well that was pretty funny and refreshing to see something tells me teach is the mastermind in the future arc since shes also the narrator of sorts but well see what happens itll be very interesting to learn how they become ultimate despair
anime,removed,i really dont understand how people hated the flashback of alma torran there is so much important information that is given in that flashback but to each their own i guess
anime,removed,i was not ready for tatsumis death but i was also high so it hit me out of nowhere usually the mc doesnt get killed off like that
anime,removed,despicable is barely any different than unlikeable that is still just you thinking they deserve hate i disagree with kommsussertods response you dont need to read evageeks for minutes to solve your doubts all the reading ever actually does is put everything the show already tells you into very simple terms the only confusions i ever had that needed to be cleared up outside of the show was just a dumbed down version of what was in the show what are the angels s they are monsters made from the brothersister of the same godlike creature that spawned all of the rest of earths life and they are actually more like humans than they look what is an at field s its a physical manifestation of the soul that evas and angels can use what are the evas s theyre chunks of flesh that were shaved off lilith and adam and allowed to regenerate until they grew into clones of them and then given weapons and armor that stuff wasnt not in the show or hidden in metaphors that you wouldnt hear if you listen shinjis new eva cross do you mean when he and his mech were getting crucified rei face moonworld i guess you mean the end when reis giant head was on the earth i took it for what it was and i was satisfied no one is gonna make you like it but youre not representing some kind of objective perspective for doing so
anime,removed,httpgogoanimeiocategorymagisinbadnoboukentv is subbed up to
anime,removed,from the top of my head s shizumas behavior in general s evil lezbo from spica student council appear a few time doing stuff in the bath s shizuma x kaori flashback s amane and hikari in the barn s the fact that chikaru is using a bunch of lolis as dressup dolls
anime,removed,guess i have to spoiler something pretty much at the end if the show mitsubishi ah i mean subaru has to fight his biggest and most powerful foe this fight will last at least episodes where subaru will fight against honda
anime,removed,why is it the incest part that made it good or the weird rapey scenes in the hospital or in the cage
anime,removed,or in the bay of pirates its too expensive on steam
anime,removed,at least he gets tortured for it i can enjoy my torture porn this way
anime,removed,he might be making his grand reappearance next episode the realest fucker in all of prisma illya s starting next episode this is the miyu route all you thought prisma illya was the illya route but you were wrong it was miyu all along
anime,removed,ehm after episode it looks like subaru has been reading ranime discussion threads cause he basically summed up what everyone thought of him
anime,removed,archer from fate emiya has no friends or allys only objectives
anime,removed,per second s that the mc just keep moving in his life so i was ok at that time then the train scene and then again i was thinking cool at least they will exchange a smile wrong to this day i praise makoto shinkai as the best troll i had suffered and then i showed the film to two of my friends and i was laughing so badly at the end
anime,removed,yet the people he cares about always seem to die
anime,removed,came into jojo totally blind and the episode where jonathan dies was legitimately mindblowing for me i mean theres no way they just kill off the protagonist right and then the narrator starts describing how everyone ends up decades down the road justwow thats a feeling i havent quite gotten since from an anime
anime,removed,that gorilla moment oo
anime,removed,yeah but there are a number of curveballs in just how far they take that theme such as when they play twister in ep and subarus development in arc they still fit the tone you just dont expect an anime to actually go that far
anime,removed,the first episode made me speechless when the camera moves around and slowly the scene turns red and its reveled nobody is actually alive i loved that
anime,removed,episode twenty three to freeze you say
anime,removed,all aboard the naruto vs sasuke hype train choochoo
anime,removed,akame ga kill for surethe original ending of the anime sucks ass with almost everyone died
anime,removed,please kaori dont end up like kaori
anime,removed,i think it pissed a lot of people off when that new character came in at the end and essentially restarted the same problem they already had
anime,removed,i liked the show but not for the romance it was the obscure reverse harem type romance there wasnt any real progression besides the moment when s yona meets her fathers killer again
anime,removed,she better not go s out the way kaori goes
anime,removed,looks really nice i hope dp will continue to do this episodes and not outsource it to korea because you can see the quality drops immeadiatly so sheer heart attack will be episodes what comes after that kiras father
anime,removed,i find it funny when puck kills everyone because he doesnt have a reason to exist logically shouldnt he be the one that dies instead of the world ¯ツ¯ cat logic
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i cant wait until its revealed that hes the mastermind of
anime,removed,yeah i heard that too maybe because its about foreign country italy and it has dios son in it also flamboyant
anime,removed,mentioned it in another thread but angel beats s hinata and yuis goodbye where hinata said hed marry yui even if she is paralysed or cant have children that really hit me then he detailed how he would meet and fall in love with her and then the montage and bg music finished me off the fact that we never really know if they would actually meet again made it even more bittersweet tldr find a man like hinata
anime,removed,nah prepare for the never ending flashbacks of every scene were naruto and saskuke fought theres no way they will shorten this cash train
anime,removed,angel beats
anime,removed,s he went through multiple world phases where a magic god made him either nonexistent or made him the worldwide enemy i believe
anime,removed,all spoillers s tatami galaxy steins gate madoka the girl who lept through time its a movie
anime,removed,a bit of focus on azusa and her relationship with the other keions they also manage to create the least likelyobvious ship between azusa and mugi when yui said rice is amazing i just paused for a second before pointing at my screen and saying ayyyy we also got more philosophy from yui that could almost rival fun things are fun ricchan is ricchan miochan is miochan mugichan is mugichan
anime,removed,to me personally your spoiler explanation is why its good and worth watching to viewers looking for a specific type of romance anime i see lots of people asking for recommendations for romance animes that are more smature and or serious and i think they want actual intimacy and realism school days follows a more realistic path from the disasterous relationships ive seen around me in my life than most shows tend to of course there is a point where things go over the top but that is the crux of school days i think if you appreciate or yearn for a bit more realism the parts that bother people even though they are designed to do so feel a bit less cheap and annoying to the average viewer
anime,removed,truest ship is best shipitwonlastcontest
anime,removed,what obviously that would show absolute hope after all maybe nagito got it as a gift from saving a weak american soldiers life s

anime,removed,despite it being near a decade old pretty much no one here stops talking about cory in the house
anime,removed,why doesnt somebody just shoot him
anime,removed,well most assfaggots games like lol are popular because you can run them on machines and at internet cafes all the flips thais and mainland chinamen i know are into them
anime,removed,yeah shouldve kept going with daikichi being proud of her not fcking her
anime,removed,everything with that ending is something you dont want but something shichika did hime was the only one truly looking out for him the whole time while everybody in the background as well as togame were waiting for him to enact the swordsmiths prophecy out of all the characters including his own damn sister hime was the only one who didnt openly manipulate him and told him to do as he pleased even though she knew togames goal all the while going with the waves with her apathy to the outcome of who the victor would be even though she had a clear way to power when he finally got his freedom from fate by denying the prophecy he became himself rather than just a sword and the only person who recognised him that way before this transformation was hiei this is also seen in parallel with how she treated her own sword in a fairly inhumane manner vastly contrasting to how she spoke to shichika in the final duel she gives shichika the honour of a one on one with the man who delivered togames killing blow you could argue that hiei is responsible for togames death but i dont believe this to be a reality when togame was the vengeful character going after a fairly relaxed hiei the way she behaves post credit is a testament that neither she or shichika had any particular interest in the whole scheme to begin with she was just filling in the role of her family in the whole ordeal and shichika just wanted to travel and discover love now that he was free she decided to be his travelling companion to fill the gap after togames betrayal rather than take over the shogunate even though she could have become the next ruler with the way things went imo the ending is perfect because every character got their just desserts and shichika finally got a travelling partner that truly wanted to be with him and hiei got the freedom from her familys fate thanks to shichika sorry for bad spelling mobile
anime,removed,this is a clip from mobile suit gundam wing the boy heero yuy is currently on a mission that involves the girl relena its been awhile but i think the mission was to kill her so yeah its old but you can see similarities in later gundam shows that were set in an alternative universe like iron blooded orphans or gundam oo
anime,removed,aizensama i think he foresee the event in the latest arc you have to read the manga to find out though
anime,removed,griffithdidnothingwrong
anime,removed,i wonder if well get to the s cumshot scene this season id love to see the discussion thread for that but i think it might actually be too lewd for tv
anime,removed,haha its all good i wrote pretty poorly and my thoughts were disorganised but even though katanagatari isnt that high on my rankings it has imo the best final episode of anything ive ever watched my feelings went from sad during togames first dying words to betrayed when she revealed her intentions and then angry when shichika went on his kamikaze rampage and then regretful when it turned out hiei wasnt an antagonist the whole time the post credits scene was really nice and i am a firm believer that anyone who didnt like it likely didnt understand the story or were salty because togame died imo they could have developed hiei better for this role but that also would have taken away a big part of the surprise that togame was one of the antagonists all along but i feel the lack of information and characterisation is something the show tried to thrive on when you find out that the maniwani arent particularly evil either thats a real depressing shock knowing that they were just fighting for survival for the equivalent of what would have been a two cour show i think it did pretty well still salty the sisters episode was so poorly animated
anime,removed,a lot of naruto antagonists pain being the best example s naruto and pain both want to bring peace to the ninja world pain has tried narutos way of achieving peace and it didnt work pain has a plan to achieve peace naruto straight up says he has no idea how the fuck he would achieve peace

anime,removed,archer during the half of ubw the way he tried to crush his former selfs dream so that he could save himself and shirou from the torment and hell that he went through was pretty on point and realisitc
anime,removed,hes undoubtedly a villain though wants to mind control a crowd of people and create a war thats not hero like however he has great character development character development of a villain being good
anime,removed,an indirect cum shot how the fuck does that work
anime,removed,iirc fans theorized that shokuhou misaki was the number five before it was revealed they based it on toumas thoughts in in which he considers seeking the help of the power level telepath attending tokiwadai and based on mikotos mention of misaki in remarking that she doesnt trust that telepath theres another popular fan theory that i would love to see come true and it that aogami pierce is the number six it just makes so much sense
anime,removed,i havent watched it myself but i think one of the characters has like clones

anime,removed,its a perfect example of shitty writing and reverting everything new the first two movies did plotwise the children all went back to how they were near the end of the series with the exception of asuka who instead of being comatose after an depressive episode amd mindrape became a fashionable pirate
anime,removed,exactly the manga takes an unexpected dark turn at the end and i cant wait to see how they go on from there in the anime
anime,removed,you can find a translation synopsis online i think animesukis forums have one in the ln section im on a phone so cant link for you however double warning i think the writer was having issues with the publisher or something because he obviously stopped caringthinking and he proceeds to jump the shark so to speak i mean he takes a steaming pile all overwelleverything it was depressing for now just how it ends but how badly it was done
anime,removed,bathjack a swiss guard go to hell
anime,removed,there is a torrent with seeds in nyaa you can try to get sub files from httpsubscomru
anime,removed,no the writers had the amazing idea of having lelouch both live up to his own ideals as well as fulfill his objectives in the process the man was smiling all the way to the end hes honestly satisfied with this what youre asking for might be understandable in terms of pure human instinct but it would tend to be objectively pointless other than as fulfilling a desire for petty revenge which is a fine fantasy to have but the real world doesnt always work that way again look at current politics and tell me that bad people are always punished and good people are always rewarded
anime,removed,i was enjoying samurai flamenco as kinda a weird anime batman type of story where it was based in the real world but the mc became like a batman style character then that gorilla cut that mans head off and i dropped the show

anime,removed,sakurasou no pet na kanojo really really gave me some perspective the thing with mashiro on the staircase gets me spoilers ive always considered myself the slow one with no talent the one with little to offer and who is dwarfed by everyone else my friends do things like write linguistic articles for progressive news outlets organize protests one of my friends ruins a theater and put on about a play every other month some are in successful bandsand i just write i dont do much really i feel like everyone else is just so talented and far away from me watched sakurasou with my girlfriend she sees sorata chasing mashiro on the stairs and says thats me chasing you she was just being cute i guess she didnt expect it to hit me so hard i mean she makes almost three times what i make shes talented and has a serious knowledge base and just in my eyes so much more than me so much faster that i feel i can never catch up but she sees all that as just rote mundane unimportant stuff she sees me write up a ten page essay in a few hours or sees me making as and feels the same way i feel like she could be doing the same as i do if she actually triedand she feels the same about her work her knowledge base all of it the truth is we dont get a good perspective we dont know if people are ahead or behind they always feel ahead but that doesnt mean anything thats what respect is
anime,removed,but subaru still has emilia on a pedestal by the end
anime,removed,wish fulfillment remfags got what they wanted the whole episode was just pandering to remfags and it was great many consider this specific episode the best of the whole series which only shows how mediocre it was even more rem has all the traits a good waifu needs and everyone who watched a few anime sees it shes a walking stereotype but lovely done
anime,removed,yeah because what im getting from this is now theres dozens of timeliness where he still exists and mayuri dies so what hes doing is kind of pointless and very selfish correct
anime,removed,i originally watched it on bluray and agree with you that its pretty terrible on there my friend doesnt want to download it though and gogoanimes version wasnt much better so i assumed crs would be alright how wrong i was
anime,removed,you really think rezero isnt getting a dub im positive this show is getting one since erased got a dub theres no way a show as popular as this one isnt getting one im betting its funimation whos gonna dub it mostly because of the funimationcrunchyroll partnership and if it gets the fullmetal alchemist brotherhood dub treatment a dub most people here agree is great itll be in good hands im not worried at all honestly
anime,removed,i am sorry i didnt realize he had the power of plot armor p
anime,removed,oh god yes i actually went and binge read the manga last week cause i was soo hyped to see evil reigen
anime,removed,i would have spent quite a lot of money you can read the web novels online for free but thats neither here nor there you keep saying we know nothing which is really a huge exaggeration theres a lot we still dont know but there are plenty of things we learned throughout the series i would say this complaint holds for essentially every long work you just arent going to know much in the grand scheme of things when you arent too far in in this case we learn information about the world for the most part as subaru learns it if they somehow crammed everything there is to know about the world into this first season there probably would have been a bunch of info dumps and then thered be a lot of complaints on that end its impossible to please everyone in this regard
anime,removed,i predict that watching brave witches will push me over some kind of limit the rcmp has and theyll burst down my door and arrest me for having shit taste in lolis and ill be sentenced to marathon all of fatekaleid liner prisma illya
anime,removed,
anime,removed,didnt he have that ptsd though his loved ones did die but as long as he had the confidence that he could return by death and save them it didnt break him similarily okabe only fully broke when he came to the realisation that he couldnt save mayushii the fact that they initially cope differently with the deaths isnt all that unbelievable imo in fact it wouldnt be unreasonable for a character with a fitting characterisation to not break at all but neither subaru not okabe were such characters when rem snapped him out of his ptsd he was able to power through the rest because he had clear goal that he put his mental resources towards he simply couldnt afford to be held back by being overloaded with stress he probably wasnt completely freed but its certainly possible to force it into the background while working towards another goal as for his behaviour in episode that was exactly because he didnt actually love emilia at that point he had a crush on her and emilia didnt fit the expectiations he had about her so he tried to force her into those expectations and wasnt able to accept it when she called him out on it
anime,removed,wait till season when mob and the world discovers who reigen really is
anime,removed,it sure is special because mangaka rarely do it not because murata didnt animate anything in opm that is just common
anime,removed,gurren lagann new game angel beats

anime,removed,as a person who enjoyed the yuribaiting am i the only one fine if they go the not yuri route and just go the straight route i will prefer if kyoani ditches a little the ln and goes yuri way but im ok either way considering the writer dark as in oregairu dark probably dark as in qualidea dark lets not have shitty animation dark in oregairumadoka way of course in good drama way
anime,removed,oh yeah thats for sure i also really wish s hanekawa could get a boyfriend shes earned it

anime,removed,by the end of the movie you have them meeting as spirits random time resets and tons of shit just kinda happening and them falling in love in a clusterfuck it was a mess the first half was a interesting slice of life the second half was just a mess of ridiculous random twists and plot conveniences twirled into a mess
anime,removed,classic nazi mod get over it
anime,removed,tokyo magnitude an the grand reveal about little brother
anime,removed,she wont dieshe cant die theres so much development in the game that hasnt happened yet
anime,removed,oh of course there is absolutely no argument that could pierce your mighty intellect i simply shrivelled up in response to what was probably the most flawless and perfectly delivered piece of writing i have ever read also top kek bringing your insecurity in with you where the fuck did sjw come from i guess we just gloss over the fact that you are autistic enough to actually think people exist under fucking acronyms or that your opinion somehow equates to anything more than your own internal ramblings have a good one
anime,removed,the list is bad imo it doesn t even have gon transformation from hxh
anime,removed,a private torrent network iirc someone pleason correct me if im wrong
anime,removed,rip crunchyroll but that save point holy shiiiiiit
anime,removed,
anime,removed,its a private torrent tracker the application process is actually really simple and i dont think ive ever heard of anyone being rejected its mostly useful for pirating things licensing by funimation and obscure titles that said this thread is gonna get removed because animebytes operately illegally
anime,removed,yeah im not a medical professional but it definitely seems like paranoid anxiety its understandable regret like missing your mothers death through skipping out on her and knowing that your last words to her were youre not a child you can go alone stop bothering me would weigh very heavily on a person i would imagine in other anime where similar things have happened s menmas death in anohana and s kouseis mothers death in your lie in april the characters are deeply affected and manifest a huge range of problems as a result could the paranoia cause his death well i guess the ultimate manifestation of the paranoid anxiety if left untreated would be an almost ocdlike obsession with being near to his grandmother at all times so that he can avoid missing her death and since we know in the parallel world at least she manages to live at least ten more years yeah i can imagine that would be crippling coupled with the gnawing regret from the first incident both spoilered events occur before the start of the show and their occurence is clear from episode but ive tagged them just in case
anime,removed,private anime tracker one of the few places you can actually speak about anime without it devolving into memes or trolling
anime,removed,they are gonna give us suffering next week finale its gonna be about why the letter was blank and the only reason is rem who wrote it got attacked by arch bishop gluttony similar to how subaru got possessed after killing betelgeuse the white whale is not the real gluttony mark my words here and no i have never read the lns before
anime,removed,dont worry nexy episode will have tons and tons of it
anime,removed,emilia was shocked because she is the last to know about these important stuff regarding the king candidate alliance spoiler
anime,removed,truely truly slothful
anime,removed,s why would they forget her though she survived the white whale attack so even if she was killed offscreen they should still remeber her though i have been wondering why ram hasnt asked subaru about her yet
anime,removed,she is going in a coma and is a vegetable who know one remembers got attacked by ley and regulus two sins
anime,removed,s do you think they werent together after that ending
anime,removed,people can still figure it out and trust me they will wink wink
anime,removed,calm yourself emilia was too kind then to be the witch the witch of gluttony created all the mabeasts so that they can consume mana from the air and people can kill them to eat their flesh that was to eradicate hunger this is not spoiler but was probably kept out of the series for what is what we dont know why the witch of envy killed them all might be for good reasons the witches might not be that bad at all
anime,removed,one thing that wouldnt really make sense but s is crutsch already trying to screw them over its not really in her character and wouldnt make much sense unless she doesnt care about the mining and just wanted help with the whale but it would be a nice lead into the backstabbing of the royal selection for nextseason
anime,removed,people dropping shinsekai yori because of gayyuri relationshipwhich are for like episode
anime,removed,did you see the leaked scene from the finale rip your dreams
anime,removed,not for long unfortunately
anime,removed,rip out dreams in the finale
anime,removed,wellllllllllll
anime,removed,thats really funny considering what happens later in kizu
anime,removed,rem is gonna get rekt into a coma and no one remembers her it already happened since the letter is blank and subarus save point cant save her last few seconds will be him talking about rem to someone and they will say who
anime,removed,really enjoyed reading your writeup glad you enjoyed the latest season and am a bit surprised that you cant choose between the shogun and the fs arc i guess its because they are good for different reasons which is why you cant compare the two what did you think of the end of episode i rewatched it so many times and i just how the anime adapted s sasakis final email to his wife thinking about what name to give to their daughter and nobumes scream at the end was chilling and made me apperciate aya hirano more as a voice actress favorite antagonists takasugi kamui jirocho and oboro oboro has to be my favorite antagonist in the series takasugi is a second close though how could i give it anything other than an overall you could give it p but seriously gintama had fantastic arcs and the latest two arcs in the manga are really great too

anime,removed,these are always interesting still havent finished watchingwriting one myself will probably be short though since theyre mostly psychological references which arent exactly my field i did however spot a fallacy as is often the case with ancient philosophy booksknowledge dont require civilization as a stepping block in fact the chicken or the egg isnt even a paradox the egg was obviously first on account of reptilesamphibiansbirds p
anime,removed,well technically its used as an idiom but that was before people learned of evolution now its more akin to fallacy referring to the chicken and the egg in regards to civilization still holds true languagespeech was invented before writingbooks many thousands of years earlier as were toolsimplements methods of agricultureanimal husbandry etc each was developed in geographically separate locations which are nearly identical in many cases the same applies to evolution nature has consistently come to the same biological solutions despite no genealogical connection its developed the eye ear and other organs using the same structuremethod and even chemical compounds multiple times not much different from kleibers law where all sorts of creatures regardless of size experience roughly the same number of heartbeats during their lifespans which may vary in duration as they hypothesized its not too far of a stretch to think of animal language its also no stretch to imagine a lone human communicating with animals in the absence of humans while still inventing and perceiving civilization does help in the senses that more minds are working on the same subjects but is not necessary
anime,removed,this one
anime,removed,httpiimgurcomdvkabyx nah bro
anime,removed,hehe this is why i say ancient philosophers are often mistaken ie you exist because i think you exist is flawed because they exist regardless of what you think they exist in your mind as your perceive them would be more correct but a distinction should be made between realityself or your risk being lost in delusion as those ancient philosophers often were a world which doesnt exist unless you perceive it or runs as a machine program etc i would think those are some sort of perversion of science more akin to religion of course i cant prove it doesnt exist therefore i must entertain the possibility not likely p to observe something is to influence it and whether external reality even exists or this statement that may be true of quantum mechanics on the molecular level but it doesnt apply to anything other than that to even entertain that notion is to sink down the rabbit hole of insanity i wouldnt be the first though many philosophers have also found fault with much of the stuff that came out of century europe plato theorized that humans possess knowledge from past incarnation hehe interesting but i think that illustrates the point pretty well as being nonsense and hence those philosophers were full of nonsense p
anime,removed,not everyone has watched harry potter those people shouldnt be upset when they hear snape kills dumbledore or vader is lukes father spoilers have an expiration date

anime,removed,its been a while since ive seen it the anime is a bit weird in that there are twelve episodes but they dont flow together its more like theres an arc every three episodes where the mc gets involved with a different girl at the end of the arc they bang next episode it restarts and youll see the mc take a different route with a different girl that scene iirc is when hes s banging his childhood friend she had feelings for him when they were younger before his family moved away and later came back at this point in time due to things that happened to her earlier the only way she knows how to express her feelings is through sex its the secondtolast arc and its hinted his sister who is a shutin has feelings for him thats why shes apparently okay with watching him apparently bang some other woman im not sure its been a while and all i really remember was that it was a fuckedup series
anime,removed,not much to say about this episode besides i think im lost yea well i sort of figured youd say that we get that a lot around here with the fog the word bios is a direct ref to httpsenwikipediaorgwikiartemis goddess of life or childbirth the hunt or bow etc this is also evident from the statue presented to the viewer and has connections to the circlerhythm of life as artemis both gives and takes life a book store interesting a place most people never visit even once the answers you seek you will never find until you start to look within yourself httpsenwikipediaorgwikijeanjacquesrousseau the title anamnesis meaning memoryrecollection is the opposite of that which was discussed in the previous episodes of forgetfulnessoblivion its the search for oneself within oneself symbolized by books about vincent the butterfly is a symbol of change transformationmetamorphosis evolution butterfly wings have eyes although this reference may be more specific the only connection i can muster is in metamorphosis and metabolism meta which is what the contents of this episode were clearly about a selfreferential work which could also be described as life itself the labyrinth is symbolic but thats better explained in one the subsequent episodes edit still need to sort some thought out will edit later

anime,removed,he does and says nothing of significance he wants to feel he wants friends he wants to be right thats not even valid he does nothing of his own free will pretty much he does things because people tell him to thats separate from actually doing something yourself
anime,removed,
anime,removed,once again its just shinji doing what he thinks people want of him ie his friends in some desperate attempt to find acceptance not what he actually wants someone who truly has a will does so regardless of whether others will accept them under threatpunishment of death they do so because they known better not because they feel animals feel its a rudimentary animalistic tendency to base judgements on feelings when lacking knowledge which he certainly does lack thats the basic premise of god anyways this is a problem more widespread in the anime community or simply society in general recently too many feelsemotional entertainment to arouseprovoke people into feeling its dangerous and leads to extremist personalities
anime,removed,but he changes by the end and if you dont agree with that then its not that i dont agree its as i stated his reasons for that change arent exactly as you describe it theyre really based in his continued need for acceptance hence bypassing a will and just doing what another setgroup of people expect of him in order to gain that acceptance acceptance is overrated unless you want to become an emotional trainwreck by searching for it your entire life its a type of submission conformity and adherence to the will of the hivemind a borrowed will

ol actiony fun hated dragon balls red ribbon army arc tho booooooring boldtrigunbold watched it years ago so i dont remember anything specific but i liked it one of my first animes boldsamurai champloobold absolutely loved it really like that samurai stuff hated the ending the characters go on these life n death adventures with each other and in the end they were just likelol bai nice knowing u in a span of min like wut boldtengan toppan gurren lagannbold loved this show not overtly fanservicey characters still mattered dont remember much tho as its been years since i watched it boldonepiecebold favorite anime doesnt take itself too seriously relatively light hearted boldghost in the shellbold favorite anime love it because it isnt your typical highschool fanservicey stuff boldguilty crownbold worst piece of media ive every watched show felt like it was banking on the stereotypical forever alone type audience a lot of characters served no purpose a lot of women characters that were annoyingly fanservicey and served no real purpose high school bs boldsamurai xruroni kenshinbold just watched it recently liked it but it didnt feel like much of the characters really did anything aside from kenshin felt a bit empty tbh boldfull metal alchemist brotherhoodbold loved this show lots of fun characters were cool didnt whine and mattered boldneon genesis evangelionbold watched the tv show hated it was a very try hard anime imo i know it ran into budget issues but still even the movie that made up for the botched ending was garbo main character had no development imo like i get he died to allow humanity to evolve and not get screwed by the angels but they just portrayed this in such a stupid try hard way hate this as much as guilty crown boldcode geassbold i remember liking it despite the high school setting story made it work imo been awhile since ive watched it it could slow down at times but overall i enjoyed it boldcowboy bebopbold i really liked this been a while since i saw it boldpsychopassbold it was alright a little try hard second season was ass tho still think a lot of the characters looked to young for the positions they were in boldeden of the eastbold dont remember too much tbh i remember enjoying it but it wouldnt say it was amazing or anything boldgintamabold saw the first episodes it was booooooooooriiiiiiiing boldsteinsgatebold loved it super trippy characters made sense unique idea and looked pretty boldhunter x love it main character was never a whiny loser was a very good adventure boldone punch manbold love it if it werent so short id say it rival one piece for my fave anime had a good balance of action and comedy characters actually interested me even if they showed up for a tiny amount of time bolddeath notebold the stuff with l was good but once the two little kids showed up it got kinda meh didnt like that the main character was a highschooler makes it seem too try hard imo boldjojos bizarre adventurebold love this series it gets especially good with stardust crusader boldflclbold honestly didnt make sense to me i watched it years ago at the very least i can say i was entertained boldbleachbold at first when i started watching ti i was turned off by the highschool stuff but i pushed through and ended up really liking it didnt like the fullbring arc too much tho boldnarutobold when he was young it was a nice fun show got a lot better with shippuden tho filler is annoying as hell tho when episode came out i honestly forgot a lot of stuff so it was harder to connect with the story and get excited again still really like the show tho boldyu yu hakushobold really love this show it could drag on at times but overall a really great show imo didnt mind the highschool setting in this case i feel like highschool setting in older animes are less annoying boldebichubold saw a clip of a random hamster saying pussy on facebook did some research and ended up really enjoying the show boldtenchi muyobold watched the og one really liked this show despite being somewhat fanservicy it didnt feel forced not sure how the newer ones are like but my gut instinct tells me i wont like it i hope im wrong lol like the that it had a good balance of action and adventure as well boldattack on titanbold really liked this show it kinda made a turn towards people drama towards the later episodes rather than the titans but i still really liked it boldoutlaw starbold remember liking this one a lot dont remember much since i saw it a while ago boldspace dandybold really liked it overall some episodes were a little meh didnt like the zombie episode kinda gave me this empty feeling but im sure that was the intention of that particular episode boldfzero gp legendbold kinda a guilty pleasure of mine love nintendo so i liked this series overall but it certainly did lag sometimes bolddevil may crybold dont remember much but i liked it it was a decent show not great but decent

anime,removed,rem route finally
anime,removed,i wonder how many players will only ever complete the rem route
anime,removed,death parade is really disappointing in my opinion it is too repetitive and it doesnt work for a show like this it tries to make me care about the couple of the episode but i dont care about them especially when i know they will disappear after the episode the only ones i cared about were the first couple because i didnt know how it was going to be i dropped it at episode and s i spoiled myself a bit to see if it is worth continuing i see that it is going worse especially because i saw a picture with decim crying in the last episode i thought decim was a badass non emotional before seeing him like this but only for the first episodes it was worth it
anime,removed,school days

anime,removed,so as we all know in the fate series king arthur is a girl arturia better known as saber the idea is that the prophecy said that whoever pulled the sword from the stone would be king of england so even though the person who eventually did it was a girl merlin said they had to stick to the prophecy and that she would be king not queen now where things get weird is that arthurarturias child mordred also a girl in the nasuverse appears in fateapocrypha and a few other places throughout the series so how does this happen to quote the typemoon wiki she was conceived between artoria and her sister morgan le fay through unorthodox circumstances artoria normally female was a pseudomale at the time due to merlins magecraft so morgan enchanted her with a spell to extract sperm from her morgan developed it within her own ovary and made the child into a homunculus clone of artoria tldr merlin gave saber a magic penis

anime,removed,it wasnt hot it was incredibly uncomfortable the character building made you already despise the mother by that point so if you were emotionally invested in the show at all that scene was horrific rape more than anything
anime,removed,well if you didnt finish kill la kill then you did give up too soon but yeah as the other guy said it was more a case of the mother raping her daughter kind of an uncomfortable scene

anime,removed,well someone already posted one of fates arthurian legend retcons but im gonna post another because its funny as hell one of arthurs earliest enemies before he took over britain was king rience rience conquered a lot of stuff including ireland and north wales he was famous for taking the beards of enemy kings he had defeated and trimming his robe with them arthurs beard was going to be the twelfth however saber being a girl did not have a beard rience decided to remedy this by taking the strand of hair that sticks out from the top of sabers head ahoge saber responded to this by saying that if rience would have her strand of hair she would have his head rience was defeated by arthur in legend but his fate is never made clear according to fate saber wanted to kill him but merlin decided to give him ugly sideburns and have everyone laugh at him instead sabers ahoge then became sacred and not even the queen was allowed to touch it she now throws a screaming fit and reflexively beats the shit out of anyone who touches it as rin and shirou learn the hard way in hollow ataraxia

anime,removed,i mean the falling apart in the last ep about mins or so from the end of the final ep s im saying that shu surviving and living after everything is one of thing things i feel doesnt work with the ending he should have died with inori they were both the reason for the apocalypse virus and he was way to far gone to survive really so if the show ended with him and inori both dieing and just was over it would be better than having that wierd epilogue they did i know a lot of people say shus actions are bad development but i still think that any other year old kid put in his place would make really dumb choices too young people are emotional and quick to judge and hold grudges easy and so on so i dont think the way he acted was unrealistic for someone in his place i just think they needed to flesh out things better with the story and characters

anime,removed,cowboy bebop spoilers below obviously strictly speaking a lot of loose ends get left out ed leaves to wander with his dad jet and faye are left on the bebop their pasts and futures are still unknown in a lot of ways from that perspective one might say there are plots left unfinished but only bad stories really resolve everything because that would imply that the story is entirely selfcontained within its world cowboy bebop is the story of the crew of the bebop how they got together how they struggled how they interacted that story was completed over the last few episodes of the anime eds leaving to places unknown was the conclusion to her part of the story jet and faye being left behind by spike as he left to his fate is their conclusion to their part of the story even though we dont know what happens to them at that point it serves as a satisfactory if melancholy end to the story of their camaraderie on the bebop and of course spikes story couldnt end in anything other than a bang

anime,removed,spoilers he cant really die anyways
anime,removed,it was rushed but it wasnt a bad rush they only have episodes left and this is like the only part of the story that can be rushed and it doesnt effect much s they most likely want to get the the war and battlefield before the end of the season where they introduce heldalf or add rose to the party before the season ends

anime,removed,you will understand why ram acted so cold in the next ep i think
anime,removed,the first time i watched madoka i cared more about the shock factor of the series because this was a show that all my friends were saying dude you need to watch this this aint like any other magical girls show or dont look up this show just watch it bro needless to say i followed their advice and this show was genuinely one of the most surprising things ive watched at that point now i kinda wanna rewatch it again to see if theres more to the show than just shock factor there definitely was i just wasnt looking for it back then and to find other things i missed the first time around
anime,removed,woah woah woah woah holly shit crazy crackpot theories here emilia is the witch satella who we see apparently telling subaru she loves him is emilia in the final timeline subaru is the key to her becoming satella think homura and madoka from madoka magical subaru homura is resetting for the sole purpose of saving emilia madoka all of his resets all of his suffering was expressly for emilia so all the timelines are focused directly on her which ultimately results in emilia ultimately turning into a being that transcends time and space which may not necessarily break with the fact emilia was killed in an earlier timeline and each reset the witch becomes clearer to subaru in his time outs or something like i said crazy crackpot theory and i may or may not have violated spoiler laws by relating to madoka gg
anime,removed,ram said blank letter though
anime,removed,gintama is just straight up amazing im not even in the best parts yet according to most its been getting better and better and what ive been looking forward to watching most as of late jojo is alright at the moment ill be honest not the biggest fan of the whole monster of the week going on in of sdc i have no doubt that it will pick up in and the current season as well definitely still enjoying it a lot though s im also a little biased too because i loved young jojo so much as the main protagonist im still not entirely sold on jotaro as of yet
anime,removed,working lord of takanashi it had the charm of working but it felt kind of like a step back compared to the last season the special in the end felt kind of unnecessary to me s it felt like i watched minutes of the specialfiller just for a confession at the very end where they easily could have put it at the end of last seasonscore working quite possibly the best sol anime ive seen in a while i cared about every character in the showminus yamadas brother for some reason i found him annoying but i loved the romance that bloomed between the characters it was slow but it had a good pacing i will admit i really disliked inami in the beginning but by the end of the show she was one of my favorites almost all of the problems in the show were resolved such as the missing wife yamadas background souta confessing which was amazing yachiyo growing and wanting to move forward inami reconciling with her parents souta realizing his feelings for inami and popura growth as she questions if she can be the next chief the only real mystery is soumas background as it was never really answered but its not integral to the story so its okay score i feel i should note that each season i rated higher i dont believe i rate anime shows which have multiple seasons more than as getting better often though i kind of count episodes as a season even if its split into parts texhnolyze episodes short review i needed a shower after watching this shit i loved it though and its definitely an anime you have to watch more than once will probably give a rewatch after i rewatch lain laterwhich is probably not a good idea score i will probably bump up this score again once some things become clearer with the second rewatch mushishi season episode same as season but this was definitely darker but still enjoyable score mushishi zoku shou odoro no michi i like it when ginko meets other mushi masters so i really enjoyed this episode and loved the additional characters score kino no tabi the beautiful world episode without a doubt the best anime ive watched this week it shows the dark side of humanity without shoving it in your face as a travel goes from city to city each episode tackles a different theme or problem with society that could be present religion slavery the working industry and etc are shown when extremes are taken and havoc that can result from it the girl which took me episodes to figure out she was girl is kind of generic she just goes where she goes and absorbs and looks at different cultures she also rides on a talking flippin bike score steinsgate i had no internet for a few days so i revisited my blu ray collection and decided to go through steinsgate again i think this was my fourth time watching it and i loved it has me pumped to play steinsgate this month score flying witch for a show called flying witch this rarely happened in the shop but thats okay the show was fairly entertaining with good characters and provided many comedic moments s when the dad tried both samples of the food and was laughing and crying at the same time score currently watching mushishi shou season and enjoying it its not as dark as the first half but still has most of the charm after i finish the season i will watch the movie kinos movie and finally move on to usagi drop
anime,removed,too lated already added it
anime,removed,a cliffhanger concerning the elections i know a spoiler so there will be a cliffhangerjust not with the elections
anime,removed,so why did they receive a blank letter very suspicious though im not sure if theyll bother with that tiny detail just something to think about i guess hehehehhehh you will see in two episodes
anime,removed,assassination classroom nagisa not only i was confused at first but a good portion of the class was surprised he was male during the swimming hole episode of course when you get to his families backstory it make sense and is pretty sad
anime,removed,no
anime,removed,samurai champloo seeing the gang split off and go on their own ways with the music and credits playing made me feel so lonely and brokenhearted
anime,removed,hey just a heads up that we require the show title to be in the spoiler tag like so s this isnt a real spoiler ive removed your comment for the time being please update your spoiler tag and message me and ill unremove your comment
anime,removed,betelgeuses original body can summon about hands puck mentioned that satella is able to summon in the summarized web novel that i read once i think subaru can summon at most when he gets the ability do note that some of the fingers that got possessed seems to use between hands
anime,removed,in online articles and wikis he does but no mention of the evil spirit possessing his mind also these abilities have pros and cons like gluttony which if you eat someones name without knowing them you will suffer food poisoning
anime,removed,just checked the wiki its true
anime,removed,spoiler alert nero vanettis brother frate is actually angelos little brother who survived the murder in the first episode and got adopted int othe vanetti family he is also the person who was present and sent the letter to angelo
anime,removed,also feel like kannas gonna be that girl who has a crush on mckun but keeps on being treated as the little sister she gets a typeset character trope but isnt used exactly in the comedicromantic way you are saying s she will die very soon in the upcoming episodes and is used to build up iktas determination and character experience
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,i thought of it as mild as it comes up extremely soon to where her involvement in the series was nill ikta and kanna only meet s times total before that happens and today was already one of them
anime,removed,knew what show you were linking to before i clicked the show is great i do wish they were a little braver and didnt rely so much on the success of the original but it still manages to feel fresh and distinct despite the same formula being recycled i especially liked how s honk got all excited when she found out the school was going to close because the same happened to muse that was a fun refreshing little twist it shows us that sunrise is selfaware that theyre kind of copying the original but theyre focusing on innovating in terms of characters and interactions and aquors has some really good songs too i havent listened to all of them but in terms of music alone i might even prefer aquors to muse
anime,removed,let me give a detailed account of the plot mankind is headed for extinction so god produces proxies beings gifted with the power of creation the first of these beings proxy teams up with proxy to create rondo the perfect city however proxy is disappointed with the humans he has created so he makes a clone of himself and proxy ergo proxy and the chick the clones go on a journey to discover who they would become without the influence and burdens of the creator ergo proxy returns disappointed with the structure imposed by proxy and a fight ensues which ergo proxy wins the story ends with ergo proxy proclaiming that he is the angel of death determined to destroy the false utopia created by the proxies in order to give mankind independence and selfgovernance
anime,removed,httpswwwredditcomuserroguealicious so i finished code geass i can see why it can be considered a top five anime on mal i liked the concept and i liked how the anime was structured it played along smoothly and it didnt feel too rushed probably cause theres a sequel that being said i feel like what madoka magica felt like to me is what code geass felt like to you the only characters i cared for were lelouch and kallen suzaku was the worst character in the anime hes a good foil to lelouch but probably cause im a polisci major all his ideologies were weak and wrong hes a dumbass never once in history has a government changed from oppression form the inside out everything came ultimately from violence to change oppression cornelia was a great character and perfect antagonist cc was also a great character for the anime all the other characters were bland to me all the britannian characters were useless the other rebels were annoying also like did that one school girl really masturbate to a table to princess euphywtf the plot was good but it left a lot to be desired like the fight against the britannian empire as a whole i didnt see the sequel so i guess lelouch finished the fight but as a stand alone i kinda wanted to see more plot development from that area in the anime i also wished lelouch would show more of the geass power and the all the intricacies that come with having it it was a great plot device and i wish he got to use it to its full potential which is good i didnt feel like it was spectacular i mean from the anime you see i give a or to they are definitely as a whole not as great as code geass but i rate in terms of enjoyment and fun i had watching i also will not give suzaku the benefit of an i hate him that much
anime,removed,doesnt the conflict come from the fact that vincent doesnt believe his memories to be true vincent believes his memories to be true for the majority of the series where did you come from mosk what did you do in mosk i dont remember vincent believes he comes from mosk and this reinforces his identity as a nobody until he realizes hes not form mosk and is in fact ergo proxy emphasize how there was no defining traits that set mankind higher than the proxies this is false if you has said emphasize how there was no defining traits that set mankind higher than machines i would have pointed out that the creativity present in humans but absent in machines this is glaringly present when pino tries to draw her own picture but instead copies a humans picture to the exact detail highlights the difference between the two however you said that mankind has no traits that set them higher than proxies and so i wholeheartedly agree with your dumb statement for how could humans have more faculties than their creators by definition a proxy must have more emotion creativity etc than any human or they would not be able to create humans and that was the downfall of the proxies the end of the series declares the end of the proxy not the death of the human because the proxy cannot reproduce there will only be proxies and because the humans will outgrow the rule of the proxies to establish their own government

anime,removed,its more that death isnt an issue yet is portrayed as one for subaru he goes insane watching everyone die knowing full well they arent dead he can just hurl himself off a cliff and reset it he knows thats how it works at this point so the death of his friends means nothing he should just carry a cyanide pill around at all times i kinda thought the same when i started watching but then i realised that this would have maybe worked for an extremely detached and ridiculously inhuman character and subaru is neither of them
anime,removed,end of evangelion one of the interpretation of the plot is the fight between nihilism and uselessness of life gendos plot and the will to carry on for the good little things of life httpsmgphotobucketcomuserfallentabrismediaendofevangeliontranslatedposterjpghtml spoiler alert it doesnt give a clear answer on which one of the two forces prevails in the end

anime,removed,with what saiba said to soma in the beginning of season and manga chapter megumi never had a realistic shot imo
anime,removed,seems relevant
anime,removed,binged ending pissed me off im so sad
anime,removed,shokugeki no soma stole all the cards during the airing time sadly
anime,removed,to be honest i enjoyed it more before the romance kicked in for the first few episodes especially shirayuki was clever and strong enough to get out of jams on her own using her herbalism knowledge to create a smokescreen and escape from the first bad guy in but it eventually become just another seasonal romance
anime,removed,close enough actually no they are school girls trying to survive a zombie apocalypse purple hair girl is the most efficient zombie killer with her shovel
anime,removed,after hearing what happened to a certain character in it im glad i stopped watching taboo
anime,removed,im about pages in and its just as fantastic as i remember although the writing style is definitely something id consider a big hurdle when getting into this i had no problems with the bakatsuki version because of how its formatted its like reading a long story poem but now its a japanese writing style in paragraphs its weird and probably weirder for first time ln readers but the content makes up for it
anime,removed,has a brilliant soundtrack
anime,removed,my fav has to be the ost is so epic
anime,removed,has an amazing ost its relaxing and times and also really exciting to listen to at times i love it
anime,removed,httpnoragamiwikiacomwikinoragamioriginalsoundtrack is a great one it just has a lot of style that really makes it unique to the show httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnvmaulpheuc is also extremely good it just has so many purely beautiful and unique songs within it that span such a wide range of emotions and scenarios its not as stylistically unique but its amazing nonetheless

anime,removed,the ost with timestamps in the description i literally cannot help you here because the only song i recognize is the super creepy witch yelling song which is the only song that played at an audible volume for me i honestly had no idea there was even a song at the end of episode until i heard it and had to ask when it played
anime,removed,just finished panty and stocking and i must say im very partial to its modern ost centered around electronic songs

anime,removed,ill never understand the rampant denial of monogatari fans who insist that every panty shot or sexually provocative loli scene in the show is somehow just rife with symbolism and deeper meaning no no its fucking not not ever single shot and scene in the show is meant to be interpreted as some symbolic allegory to some deep philosophical concept some of them are just panty shots for the sake of panty shots that are put in to get perverted otakus into buying over priced bds the show tries really fucking hard to convince the watcher that it is somehow deeper than it appears most monogatari fans have fallen for it and its honestly pathetic you can write as many essays and make as many vlogs as you want but you will never make the toothbrush scene out to to be anything other than the incestuous pedophilia scene that it is monogatari is nothing more than another harem loli ecchi anime with more of the same pedophilia scenes that all loli ecchi series have get the fuck over it

anime,removed,i dunno id go with some from when theyre reviewing zaimokuzas novel yukino tore him apart yui destroys him by just saying he uses difficult kanji because she hasnt read it and has nothing else to say about it not that he knows that and then looks like hes gonna help before asking what story he ripped off that was a brutal beatdown
anime,removed,biscuit in the thumbnail low blow
anime,removed,
anime,removed,anidexmoe
anime,removed,i watched the one on gogoanime and it seemed fine
anime,removed,well in the manga you learn that there are more than basara so they already outnumber the guardians the basara weve seen so farin the fillers arent important to the main story so they are rather weak compared to the top basara such as kamui which i think is somewhere around to in ranking i dont remember seeing him too much in the manga but i think we see him again at some point in the anime again
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,yeah he doesnt want to do that after the first few episodes
anime,removed,kaochan
anime,removed,have you considered using rabbit lets you screencast off crunchyroll at the very least and you share a group chat
anime,removed,obvious ones berserk tokyo ghoul both amazing with adaptations that dont even come close to capturing them perhaps a more controversial one but i think the hajime no ippo anime is significantly inferior to the manga not just the fact that there is still a lot more content in the manga but the animation is soso and i feel there is very little impact in the fight scenes the reason the manga works so well is the feeling of speed it recreates because you get really into it and read it fast and can follow the characters thought process at the same time and morikawa does an excellent job of portraying this but the anime just feels sluggish it feels like they are moving in slow motion because they have to speak every line and it basically freezes the fight and make it seem like it lasts forever you moments in particular that really got to me in the manga but i felt almost nothing when i watched the anime were s when sendou couldnt get up from the corner during his first match with ippo and s when miyata knocked out jimmy with his high risk counter the other one is controversial because the anime is universally known as shit but you might not think the manga is great either but i love kimi no iru machi i think its a very good slice of life love story there is way too much fan service and it annoys the hell out of me but the over all story is very emotion and well done not my favourite but i still enjoy it quite a bit
anime,removed,shitty art i see that you have a shit taste on art style
anime,removed,why are people going out of their way to talk strictly about the novel in the anime discussion when no one wants them to it happens with every show i remember knowing everything that was going to happen in one punch man by episode just by visiting the discussion threads and that was without clicking on spoiler tags its like source readers want to show off that theyve read the source either that or they want everyone to jump on the hype train with them regardless if they want to or not the only thing you can do is report them but that doesnt help the fact that youve already been spoiled if its a show that i really dont want to be spoiled on ive made a habit out of waiting a few hours for all the spoilers to be removed by the mods
anime,removed,
anime,removed,because they are the best couple in the show and something something the manga
anime,removed,can someone pm me a guest pass please
anime,removed,corey in the house

anime,removed,jesus made a mistake you are just stupid at least jesus could craft wood
anime,removed,at the very end of the episode subaru realized he was being possessed because the feeling was similar to the one he experienced when he was frozen to death by puck in episode so thats why he started laughing there nice how at the time it only seems like the madness of someone about to die and now it makes that its actually the madness of someone truly slothful

anime,removed,for those who dont know the httpiimgurcombjyxgwmpng symbolizes death
anime,removed,honestly i despise animemanga that have something like that happen to a victim and then refuse to have a revenge sequenceaction whatsowever i can understand if the bully dies before the victim can do anything but still for example mirai nikki the cult girl she didnt get her revenge really her mind was just warped to think nothing bad happened i really dislike those kinds of stories
anime,removed,i used this song in my recent video
anime,removed,mirrai nikki is great but is quite disturbing spoilers theres gore yandere obsession sex dungeon kinda loli rape kid killing blinding with darts drugs kinda parent murder rape and more gore watch it is good trust me
anime,removed,he is standing at the helm of a whales horn
anime,removed,i did some research from the web novels and apparently thats not the case subarus returns by death power is due to satellas the witch of envy love satella does not love anyone else and when she met betelgeuse due to subaru intentionally trying to tell betelgeuse about his returns by death power in order to show the witch of envy to him she rejected him
anime,removed,if you thought case in any of the games was bad take a look at this episode where people are killed miayabot possibly togami as an extra
anime,removed,the documentary euphoria
anime,removed,back when goku character was actually likable till the two recent movies now they made him act like a mentally retarded kid on steroid

anime,removed,b r a v e w i t c h e s r a v e w i t c h e s
anime,removed,i wholeheartedly agree and even then the relationship kept getting side tracked by all the mad pussy that was being thrown at him that said s yuriko and fukuda even though its kind of a crack ship at the very least they had much better chemistry than what the end couple was plus my boy s fukuda deserves some amount of happiness
anime,removed,calm down lad there are too many lgbt faggots that like anime to express this kind of opinion especially not in this sub
anime,removed,who is rem i dont see anybody but suburu and felis
anime,removed,i love emilia
anime,removed,use horriblesubs
anime,removed,that was absolutely astoundingly bad i dont think ive seen a first episode this bad in years i generally like anime like this but this was just awful im definitely gonna skip out on the rest of this series
anime,removed,did we watch the same show because the animation was terrible the art style itself was good but the animation was extremely poorly done
anime,removed,no it wasnt did you not see how few frames of animation there were in virtually every scene
anime,removed,jesus they skipped like chapters though that was to be expected we did lose out on miyata backstory and development due to this unfortunately the opening does seem to confirm we will reach the fun part though honestly my favourite arc of all time gonna stay tentative and hope they handle the rest of the show well
anime,removed,uh open your goddamn eyes and look at it look at how few frames the animation has compared to most other shows
anime,removed,thats like the only scene in the entire episode that had decent animation the very first one and yes you are all fucking retarded if you cant grasp how absolutely terrible that entire episode was in every single sense of the word
anime,removed,im hostile because i cant believe there are seriously people who think this show is good it was a complete mess not just the animation but everything
anime,removed,who a seasonal waifu that everyone is forgetting now
anime,removed,some tests to qualify entering the school you see right now which is quite long also at the beginning how nozomi and miyata met the fight between hanabi and nozomi is at the ending of the if im not wrong the volume there are quite some really fun jokes there but almost everything is still grounded in reality also the scene where nozomi and hanabi fight is the second fight of the test they where taking they where grouped in groups and each group would fight times so theres a fight before the one we saw in this episode but nozomi and hanabi dont encounter i think the episode is quite well edited being able to combine seamlessly those chapters of the manga into one fight
anime,removed,i love dank memes emilia
anime,removed,werent they dreaming no they werent it is just something that the main characters believed at first they experienced the body switch but the next day their friends confirmed that they were acting weird the day before and they were also affecting each other lives

anime,removed,naruto is a gateway anime of the worst kind its a bad series a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isnt very well done by any aspect but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and darkness the normal anon can see this as the shit it is and may enjoy it hate it or be indifferent to it but all the while recognizing that the series itself regardless of their opinion is plain bad however these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie unsociable underageb faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world the superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool the jutsus peculiar colorful clothes the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the naruto world fuels their escapist fantasies while the pityparty character backgrounds emphasis on revenge and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the marysueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted selfimportance towards the world exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb retards eat this shit right the fuck up naruto is basically the series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to a which is why regardless of individual opinions it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it and ensure that no naruto threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here that being said ab is really great but nyaaeu and bakabt are easier to get into
anime,removed,i couldnt stand jj or chris i am still so annoyed that jj made the podium despite flubbing his way through two routines

anime,removed,madokami vs haruhi
anime,removed,i guess you can say kiras going to bite the dusto
anime,removed,can we reset so yuri wins gold
anime,removed,got to add that crunchy roll works on a tight schedule and they are forced to release stuffs fast so their translation sometimes are wrong or rushed and thats also shown in the quality as well theres s which compare the quality of the show on cr and tv cr got uncompleted version of anime while bluray fan sub got the completed one they release much slower tho and normally colored in blue on nyaa
anime,removed,too distracted by sloth cultists ill give you that with the introduction of betelgeuse subaru was no longer the worst character in the series
anime,removed,make madoka a true magical girl and give those poor things some happy endings ffs

anime,removed,that boob is called beachkun and the next arc is hilarious
anime,removed,gogoanime
anime,removed,shinji from fatestay night i heard he gets much worse but based on ubw he hasnt done anything that would make me hate him he just makes me laugh a lot whenever he appeared it doesnt help that hes voiced by kamiya hiroshi as well molesting rin kinda put him on my douchbag radar
anime,removed,one thing that i really want to know is what the deal is with this scene because im not used to seeing minori this pissed off im not sure what would be able to trigger that kind of reaction unless ryuji makes taiga cry funny you would pick out that particular scene because it is the only scene in the openings that is actually lifted right from a scene in the show when does it happen what is happening oh time will tell
anime,removed,except its not a fujobait its a sports anime the mcs just happened to fall in love they just happened to be dudes it would be fujobait if they s didnt express their love publicly many times or get engaged
anime,removed,is it though the fibers flew off and ragyo said theyll be back maybe they left it open for another but may not necessarily go for it im pretty happy with what we got 😊

anime,removed,stroheim vs goku a reminder that goku s is an idiot who has never kissed his wife in ten years of marriage yes im saying to vote for the nazi
anime,removed,i dont think ive heard anything about this but going off my knowledge id say one of the ones to be animated is shield hero httpwwwmangapandacomtatenoyuushanonariagari httpsyoraikunwordpresscomtnychapters
anime,removed,the buildup to it is perfect the soundtrack is perfect the actual moment itself is beautiful and bonechilling and afterwards how his demeanor shifts as the music picks up to usher in the end of the episode is super memorable if you havent seen gankutsuou this probably wont stand out much to you on its own but in context its one of the most memorable moments ive seen in anything
anime,removed,add half a year to release date then add week then look for fansubs on toronto no thanking random internet person

anime,removed,my favorite is when roy mustang is crying over hughes grave he asks lieutenant hawkeye why it is raining because he is crying while most people think he said that to hide the fact he was crying i think he said it was raining because mustang felt that he couldnt do anything because he is useless in the rain
anime,removed,not everyone in the military is a national alchemist the fuhrer is just a talented old man with lots of experience that is why i find him so great he is the top boss of the country without resorting to cheating with magic
anime,removed,remove her and the one mc loses the person she leans on when she is struggling with a difficulty or is confused about something also the mc relationship with the other mc falls apart and ends their sisterlyrelationship and possibly the series
anime,removed,togame though
anime,removed,ehh that would be the original brotherhood goes heavy into the save everyone territory
anime,removed,dont die too soon the battle is not over yet it is true that megumis chance is slim but i think the story will become more interesting if megumi ship happen to be canon since it is less stereotypical and can produce somewhat crazy development ahead hence im still aboard on the ship despite all the odds
anime,removed,ya the second i started learning about chelseas background it became a simple waiting game
anime,removed,it was a average battle
anime,removed,s im sure thats what rem wanted to say to betelgeuse too
anime,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo
anime,removed,this is fucking terrible kys
anime,removed,not even interested in watching the show so i dont care about spoilers but that one is a fucking bomb considering what the anime is about sounds heartwrenching
anime,removed,
anime,removed,so will it be an hour like part kind of hard to believe they will get through the fights plus end fight animation looks fantastic and cannot waiting in pain for the subs to be released
anime,removed,except in chihaya route
anime,removed,ill admit i didnt have any idea how they planned to do the crossover of tales of berseria and tales of zestiria in but i wasnt expecting s to just be a straight berseria episode im still not even sure how theyre going to do it now but it seems like it could have been a bit more graceful more subtle i dont know it still may be too early to judge
anime,removed,sigh bring the down votes and whatever ive been watching the first and second gen eps again recently and they are all better than this in terms of build up and result the battle here is just a bunch of colors and auras flying at each other throwing projectiles and having your typical last big clash move where the author can cop out the result that they want immediately after the clash there is no attrition or thought leading up to the result there is nothing clever or hype about this fight

anime,removed,i would love to watch it and discuss but the torrent is at leechers and seeders
anime,removed,qualidea code is decent perhaps your standard is kinda too low the only interesting thing is its plot twists where canaria got killed and only the princess is likable in the whole cast the rest are pretty mediocre
anime,removed,im sure its been discussed before somewhere but has there been any talk of doing something about the fanart theres a million different subreddits dedicated to that kind of thing and its getting more than a little annoying to me at least that more than half the front page of this one is it maybe have a fanart day or something
anime,removed,onodera should have won
anime,removed,has the summaries of the first novels quite interesting to read right now it is translated until right after the capital is retaken
anime,removed,trying to find a streaming video of the fandub but cant seem to get my hands on it any suggestions on where to look
anime,removed,ecks dee
anime,removed,but zestiria wasnt bad had they not retardedly removed alisha from the story there would have been a lot less angry people around im not an expert on the rest of the tales games so i cant say this with certainty but from what ive seen zestiria is not bad compared to the rest of the games though the main villain was kinda lame i had imagined fighting something more epic than a kitty when they talked about the lord of calamity
anime,removed,damn was hoping for a plot twist
anime,removed,here are two images of wilhelm and his wife from rezero love story of the sword deamon
anime,removed,can tell you about fma and cowboy bebop fma has two movies conquer of shambala is a movie finale meant to finish the original fma series sacred star of milos for brotherhood is after hughes death but before the elrics find out about it cowboy bebop doesnt have a real strict timeline so the movie fits anytime after ed joins the crew but before the finale if you can always google the information if you want a exact episode where it fits
anime,removed,no wonder wilhelm wanted that whale dead
anime,removed,crazy episode the death flags are real young wilhelm and theresia were awesome looking seeing a master swordsman in action was bad ass white whale is a real problemthey fucked it up on the outside but its still kicking and now theres more than one someone better come up with a genius plan quick also seeing a glimpse of satella when subaru mentioned return by deaththat was chilling only complaint is that the animation of the fights felt a little lacking guess we cant have everything be like elsa vs reinhard p
anime,removed,i love you
anime,removed,cough your lie in april cough episodes later nothing literally the densest mc
anime,removed,one of them already met sorey but scared him away the first time they met
anime,removed,hi im new holds up spork my name is katy but u can call me of lolas u can see im very random thats why i came here meet random ppl like me im years old im mature my age tho i like watch invader zim w my girlfreind im bi if u dont like it deal wit its our favorite tv show bcuz its soooo random shes random of course but i want meet more random ppl like they say the more the merrier lolneways i hope make alot of freinds here so give me lots of commentses dooooommmm me bein random again hehetoodles love and waffles of
anime,removed,i ended up in a conversation with ulaethas in pm and judging from the number of upvotes i got apparently other people want to know about it so im pasting it here laethas i wanted our mc act once she realized something was wrong and i wanted her to reject the views of her society rather than just thinking they were wrong but go along with them anyway i guess i kinda wanted her to rebel or something like that which i got a little bit of at the very end where she grants mercy to squealer a great character by the way but i would have liked to see more than that me i thought about saki doing something like that but i think that it is just impossible to rebel if she rebelled successfully how would she reform the society the messed up society in shinsekai yori is the best possible one i could think of given the premise that everybody has superpowers laethas thats why i said i would have liked to see it go in a different direction although it would have had to be completely rewritten in order for these changes to make sense such as a way for people to get around the death feedback would have had to have been foreshadowed from very early on they wouldve had to have let more of the main cast survive especially sakis first love and they also would have had to have lessened the negative vibe that squealer gives off and so yeah given what we got that is the best ending but i would have enjoyed it had it taken a turn somewhere early me ok so basically you dislike unhappy endings thats understandable that said i generally find endings that are not happy more interesting it feels more realistic for me laethas thats not what im saying i think it would have been a nice touch of duality if her rebellion had ended up causing most of the village as well as herself to perish that would have been awesome and would have been reminiscent of the novel brave new world which i really liked and has a lot of similarities even the title i actually prefer bittersweet endings or tragedies most of all i mean my favorite ending was the ending of code geass and it doesnt get more bittersweet than that me actually that was apparently touched upon in the novel i didnt want to believe it but i felt that if the new order wasnt sealed with a massive amount of bloodshed it might never take hold from maybe shinsekai yori just needs a sequel laethas thanks for showing that to me if there is a sequel i might just get more something like code geass this could be exciting
anime,removed,really wow i loved akame ga kill since it was the first anime i watched where characters s can and do die
anime,removed,actually reinhard is invincible so not even whales would be enough im not even joking s reinhard took the sword saint blessing from theresia during her fight with the white whale significantly weakening her which among other things lead to her loss
anime,removed,well she is s reinhards grandma
anime,removed,s so not gonna happen this season how popular is rezero right now in japan to get a new season
anime,removed,
anime,removed,unless of course emilia is the jealous witch thatisthejoke
anime,removed,add one degree of separation
anime,removed,well s it can be instantly deduced that they are somehow related since they both have red hair blue eyes and the astrea family name wilhelm did say he married into her family as well
anime,removed,s yes wilhelm is reinhards grandpa
anime,removed,please where can i illegally read all this pm the website
anime,removed,s subaru sees her and says that she looks exactly like emilia but its not confirmed if theyre actually related also satella and the witch of envy are different personalities but they both love subaru
anime,removed,finally done though chapters to finally get a confession
anime,removed,ecks dee
anime,removed,you should spoiler tag that i didnt read the spoilers nukemind wrote but interesting way of showing it in a reply to a guy saying i love you come on
anime,removed,gintama watched episodes in the last two days so thats been pretty fun finally reached my first two arcs in the show out of the two i thought the memory loss arc was way better than the train samurai arc because it had me laughing and feeling emotional also episode was fucking amazing katanagatari the plot progression and dialogue are both absolutely brilliant so far cant get enough of the animation music and the interactions between shichika and togame scenes like just warm my heart cowboy bebop put this off for awhile but glad i finally got back to it i was welcome back into the bebop universe with that amazing fridge episode which had me laughing at the end entire show is a fun ride and it has the perfect mix of action drama and humor and never seems to have too much of either three one of the best casts ever enjoyed the later episodes especially when it got into the range score jojos bizarre adventure stardust crusaders usmurfrockrune letting ya know im finally on jojo part pretty cool intro to jotaro so far im liking the idea of the whole idea of stands so far and im happy to see joseph still in the mix even if he isnt the main focus s oh boy dio is back this should be interesting
anime,removed,it seemed really helpful that i wrote out what i was going to watch last week so ill be doing that again jojo i finally finished this anime i dont remember how long ive had this on my watching at least one year maybe more this doesnt even count the fact that i watched the first episode in when i heard this series finally got a good anime the anime itself was good seemed pretty faithful to the manga which i already read im not sure if the anime gets kind of boring in the middle or if its just because i had already read the manga so i knew what was going to happen im probably not going to start watching part for a while minamike okaeri i dont really have much to say other than i finally finished it its not as bad as season but still just meh i know in like six months ill try to watch season hoping season will be good but it probably wont be i like the manga though ladies versus butlers ovas music video i finished it and got what i wanted basic high school story good ecchi drills went from meh to best girl i dont have much to say about this anime but if youre looking for an anime to get turned on too this one is pretty good oh yeah the ovas and the music video are there for you to touch yourself there is no plot just the girls getting further and further naked combined with parody clapping noises midori days me wanted to watch this and so i finally got around to it i already read the manga a few years ago so i knew what i was getting into its an okay anime i didnt notice that ecchi tag until breasts showed up but it only happened in the first episodes and then never again also pretty weird that the anime ended a month before the actual manga ending the ending seemed similar enough and i dont care enough about it to check the last chapter of the manga to confirm oh yeah and i have shit taste i wanted midori to end up with her childhood friend and mc to end up with the cute tsundere obviously that wasnt going to happen anyway this week i plan to start spice and wolf season i watched the first episode of locodol last week so i expect to continue watching it this week im thinking ill watch aria the natural daily again once i finish these shows ill probably slow down and work on the long anime on my watching list that i havent finished
anime,removed,he has her hair and his eyes
anime,removed,to be fair theresia died years ago so her divine blessing of sword saint probably already got inherited and she was just a master swordsman without broken blessings coupled with the fact that she was probably way older than her prime its not too surprising that the whale was able to defeat her
anime,removed,reinhards grandmother
anime,removed,whale is actually gluttony the homonculus
anime,removed,i just realised something about the white whale its actually a narwhal
anime,removed,she is his grandmother
anime,removed,she had a boyfriend are you talking about watari
anime,removed,how does it feel knowing that ryoka is the most popular girl of this season right now in japan thank god japan isnt filled with gaylords like you
anime,removed,lol is that liquid ocelot in the middle so he didnt die in he was teleported to here as drifter xd
anime,removed,ayyy me tootwo someone tell me which is correct pls except i lost my first account after months and hadnt verified my email so i couldnt recover it hence demonicmandrill was born i first started watching anime last year now according to mal ive spent days watching anime i regret nothing
anime,removed,captain jack sparrow i am a bot i have corrected people
anime,removed,theres a lot to say about the coachs mentality but the anime will explain it on its own
anime,removed,if someone knows where to find it you can mention here that you know of a streaming source but send the actual link or name via pm to the op
anime,removed,once again im going to provide my opinions as a reader of the light novels on this episode some things i found were adapted well and some things that were done differently i have to say i really liked this episode and probably not for the reason anyone might think i knew that the anime would adapt the character side stories as they did last week with nemurins dream before she died but i wasnt expecting them to go above and beyond with including all of them the beginning of this episode where top speed takes swim swim to the mountains was not in the original light novel but in top speeds side story half of it anyway the other half is a top speed spoiler this is good since the scene provides good characterization of both top speed and swim swim secondly the peaky angels making a pv was also a side story although it goes into a bit more detail than just them deciding to make a pv and then having one they tried various different stunts first which the side story covers in a lot of detail this is the part where i didnt realize the anime would adapt but im glad they did i like the pacing so far they space out the eliminations where nemurin was eliminated in episodes and it looks like the next elimination wont happen till at least next week whereas in the ln you get an elimination once per chapter so this chapter thing is actually good for the plot as i felt it gives more time for the characters to develop and one thing i like about mgrp throughout the books is the characters interactions and developing the setup at the end with la pucelle already at the tower with snow white when rulers team comes to steal their candy is setup a bit differently than the ln s they actually planned to intercept one of them so that snow white doesnt have la pucelle to protect her making her an easier target since they know its a hangout spot instead of approaching when both of them are there i dont think it makes that huge of a difference in the long run though as its only a minor difference i said this before but i love that they switch povs this episode clearly shows how the book handles it with a huge chunk of episode in the ln focusing on rulers team instead of snow white or any other magical girls looks good for future episodes as ive said last week mgrp does not like to focus on one character too much since they avoid the main protagonist role as best as they can by switching to every character and thats my thoughts on the episode i cant wait for the next one its going to be a good one ill leave you all for those who are curious with a mild spoiler for what i wish ill get to see next week probably get you hyped too spoilered just in case s la pucelle vs tamapeaky angels hype
anime,removed,it squanders an good premise with a op gary stu selfinsert character and rushes through the interesting setting of a death game its literally called sword art online but they only spend half the season playing that game before going onto generic elf fantasy land it also is super haremy as every female character wants a piece of said op gary stu selfinsert and underuses its female cast asuna is reduced to a damsel in distress who gets felt up by a tentacle monster sinon basically exists for ass shots and sugaha is just there for some incest drama most egregiously for me however is the fact that the rules of the world are changed for kirito alone i like a story where the rules are strict and apply to everyone it was a game where if your health reached zero you died in the game and in real life this did not apply to kirito nor his waifu in the end which really annoyed me its not all bad it tends to have really good visuals and the overall concept is good the soundtrack is really good it just could have been so much better
anime,removed,we already knew fav was gonna be kyuubey so he really just confirmed what was known let the games begin
anime,removed,i think homura from madoka could be an interesting vill wait shit
anime,removed,but she does have these weird ghost things around her its because shes currently being haunted those ghost things are why shes had that low constitution all her life
anime,removed,well technically
anime,removed,ryuko matoi is a go to for me that episode where she was being controlled was amazing to me and she actually made a scary villain plus through the whole series i felt her personality was more a anti hero than a protagonist who sometimes bordered the villainous side
anime,removed,his health bar literally hit zero disappears then reappears as a phantom and stabs kayaba thats how they win explain how that is not bullshit
anime,removed,i use an anime app called animedlr on android instead of a website its pretty good
anime,removed,ah ok didnt realize that i guess i was thinking that hina is best girl from the perspective of rei whereas from our point of view yeah shes super young iirc agreed with akari taking care of her sisters wo parental support that cant have been easy but she handled it like a champ
anime,removed,i havent commented in a couple of episodes because i kinda forgot but from now on ill try to write something here everyday again we start the episode with the brothers finding out that the library has been completely burned to the ground the ones guilty for this are lust and gluttony gluttony smells scar he and lust go after him but they fail in killing him and just end up handicapping him httpimgurcometdwuvm somehow ive always thought that gluttony is really adorable i mean hes scary but at the same time he just wakes some kind of motherly instinct in me wishing i could make him feel better by giving him a big hug him make him a great meal and telling him itll all be good that hell get to eat scar later maybe not really hes just so sweet he was always my favourite out of the humuculi i just wish he werent a baddie back with the elric brothers they meet brosch and ross yes of course they arrive at sheskas place and its i really wish i could have a place like hers someday full of nothing but books i found it funny how look ed there is something good about being small sniggers they now meet the wonderful adorable bookworm sheska and ask her about marcohs book she remembers it and they fall in despair because it was in the burnt down library after all but fret not my dear brothers because sheska has the ultimate super power of remembering a book perfectly after reading it just once im really jealous of that power btw it takes her days to write everything down but finally the brothers get a hold of the books that are supposed to contain the secret of the philosophers stone finding out the secret couldnt be just that easy of course marcoh didnt just write down everything in plain text so that anyone could just find out how philosophers stones are made no the elric brothers now have to decode cook books i really wonder how much money ed gave sheska oh well main thing is that she got her mother in a good hospital and right after she even gets a job gotta love hughes and his kidnapping tendencies and so the elric brothers continue trying to find out the secret of the philosophers stone man those two can concentrate well if only i had half of their concentration ability on the day or maybe even earlier but they might have been in denial and tried to look for anything else and failed they finally find out what is needed for the philosophers stone and that is human lives it truly is the devils research just like marcoh warned edward the brothers tell brosch and ross to just forget about it and pretend like they didnt know armstrong becomes suspicious of them and they cant keep it a secret armstrong comes barging in to the room where ed and al are understandably so moping around in frustration disappointment not knowing what to do from now on the truth truly is cruel the truth beyond the truth that marcoh spoke of against armstrongs orders the brothers go to investigate lab i wonder what might they find there i feel like this became a lot longer than i had intended for it to become

anime,removed,its honestly my favorite anime d every time i watch it theres something new i love about it everything from the characters to the animation to the story to the music are just spot on even the plot progress spirals forward exponentially accelerating ie whole first season from underground to controlling above ground vs last episodes from space flight to destroying space time xd

anime,removed,yes
anime,removed,not sure if you know this but the word trap is really really offensive to trans folks like myself its a derogatory slur that implies trans folks especially transwomen are deceiving people for sex and that to have sex with a trans person is to be fooled the reason that this is dehumanizing is for a number of reasons the first of which is that its very disrespectful of trans peoples gender identities that it to say it partially if not fully buys into the narrative that trans people are dressing up like their preferred gender and are not actually real furthermore it implies deception which is not true because we are out preferred gender there is no deceptionto say otherwise would be very transphobic as it invalidates ones gender identity wheh i think thats everything thanks for the consideration

anime,removed,ay hunter x hunter is right up your alley its finished airing with episodes and i think is probably the best long running shounen series because it has no fillers at all has consistent quality doesnt have any friendship super power instant crap that isnt explained and also a lot more serious and darker i think for an airing ongoing one i would like to suggest re zero kara hajimeru isekai seikatsu or re zero for short it was rated anime of the season for spring and still is anime of the season for summer at the moment its a episode season and currently at episodes so far i think it would be an interesting anime thats a different genre from what you usually think but not too different for you to be unfamiliar with it has the fantasy element the mc is an otaku who got transported to a fantasy world he thinks hes going to get all the girls become super powerful and thinks hes the protagonist of this world and everything will work in his favour but thats not in his case he realises hes really weak and gets killed then he comes back to life but at a certain checkpoint now he has to struggle to create the perfect route where everyone is happy and alive while being killed consistently because he is so weak its a tale of the mcs perseverance and how his mind slowly starts to spiral out of control

anime,removed,i recently rewatched both anime adaptations and as much as i do like fullmetal alchemist its like an while brotherhood is a for me there were quite a few things in the writing that i just couldnt get behind and showed signs of having less time to think the story out of course its all subjective but specifically s scars entire plot feels completely opposite to his character though honestly his motivations in general felt extremely muddled to me s episodes and basically the filler episodes all felt really really boring and almost added nothing to the overarching story or development of important characters s lusts death was very disappointing for all the characterization they gave her compared to the manga and brotherhood s dante wasnt really that interesting of an antagonist especially compared to father the villain from conqueror of shamballa was even more forgettable those are about the main issues i have with the writing specifically there are other issues i had specifically with the english dub but thats not on the original anime staff

anime,removed,convince you why would i bother trying youre a lost cause too busy with the mods dicks in your mouth this is so useless just let the mods handle things like you want them to and stop pretending like you matter in all of this
anime,removed,people like you is why this subreddit is the most cancer one
anime,removed,according to reports even mentioning the name of the part thats being spoiled is itself a spoiler i suggest you edit your comment with two separate tags one that contains the name of the part and the other that contains the actual spoiler something like this s show name s words go here and things happened

anime,removed,not on no ads any quality your devicewifi can handle
anime,removed,i see no reason to bother since torrents do everything that i want anyway
anime,removed,i would steal every upcoming animes budget and tank their projects if it meant berserk got a proper wellmade series with no story arcs cut out
anime,removed,hey i know im new here but i just wanted to make an account to say vote for rukia kuchiki since i cant exactly embed image links with spoiler tags bleach animemanga spoilers ahead rukia is one of the best written female characters in shounen and her development has been nothing short of beautifully tragic abandoned by her sister when she was just a baby rukia has been looking after herself for her entire childhood and eventually not only studied to become a shinigami but was adopted into the kuchiki clan which is essentially royalty in the bleach universe rukia may be a noble at this point but she grew up in the lowest form of poverty possible and worked her way to the top because of this she always resented the special treatment she received because she believed respect should be earned by your personal achievements and not by whose family you are affiliated with despite this she begrudgingly accepted that she would have to live with this until she met her superior kaien shiba whom lectured her scolded her and respected her as a person and never treated her any differently than her subordinates for a time she was happy until she was forced to kill the man who she looked up to kaiens death broke rukia internally despite him thanking her for it she saw it as this is entirely relevant to my next point where rukia proves herself to be a fantastic character she confronts espada who had tried to deceive rukia into believing that he was kaien shiba facing her fears and her inner depression are her focal points leading to someone who wants to be this sociable person whom people can look up to and admire however the guilt she has kept internally for so long means that she wants to keep those who she loves away from her is literally the most beautiful sword in soul society but its also a perfect reflection upon herself its an ice type zanpakuto which resembles the distant and sorrowful emotions that rukia feels internally and its beautifully elegant and modest just like her honestly her biggest flaw is that she doesnt get near enough screentime than she deserves a fantastic characterization and since the manga is still ongoing her character arc is not over yet hell she practically steals every scene shes in its a shame that she isnt more popular on this sub shes gonna lose to winry in the next round anyway so its cool
anime,removed,anime only watchers just arent ready for megumi vs ryou omg this season is gonna be hype

anime,removed,what i have been saying from episode three that there is no way that kabaneri compares to aot why characters are all shallow with the exemption of mumei maybe world building is nothing short of a joke showed promise at the start monster created by fusion of a million little ones really are we ikoama is borderline stupid when he tried to lever the rock from mumei which would have killed her if he succeeded dont get me started on his generic power of determination attitude the show is not good at best it is a guilty pleasure
anime,removed,yandere was maybe the correct term here but lets go with deretsun sounds cool
anime,removed,just after yui gets deleted and where they get called back to help the guild
anime,removed,for once they are not in a the linecrossing ceremony was passed on to japan by western sailors during the meiji era and since then most japanese ships even the and the current celebrate it this episode felt like it returned from highschool fleet back to haifuri however according to with mikes voice actor there is going to be some sort of twist in the following two episodes and this was sort of a break episode i guess we just have to wait until next week to find out

anime,removed,honesty this jeko guy is the most oretentious shit eating leech on this sub worse than a neet he actually siphoned off even more of societies money so he critically review anime which i guess is one of the few important things lit majors do

anime,removed,s but all his development never happened because of the time reset
anime,removed,i dont think i can ever watch it again it was like a knife through the heart since i was investcdeepvas hell
anime,removed,i have a monogatari one as well but its araragi and shinobu they have a very unique relationship that obviously transcends romance but when it does get a little romantic between them in a weird way it makes me think they should be together sometimes i know araragi belongs with hitagi and hitagi is my best girl for sure but theres a few moments between araragi and shinobu throughout the series that are amazing and make me really happy sin mayoi jiangshi when they were stuck in the post apocalyptic alternate timeline with just eachother they were amazing together and a part of me almost wished they would have stayed in that world together forever and in shinobu time when shinobu gets jealous at araragi for letting ononoki kiss him and then he kisses shinobu is honestly one of my favorite moments in the series theres a few great moments between them in the ln of kizumonogatari as well but since it isnt all animated yet i wont spoil them i dont even like lolis so im not even attracted to shinobu in her younger forms but i really just love her and araragi together

anime,removed,throw that pride avatar thing out the window that doesnt concern this show until later arcs
anime,removed,sorry i mightve not made myself clear enough dxds author definitely doesnt know hes written a bad plot if you keep with it or if you read the novels i dont recommend them youll see that the story goes in very serious directions when it isnt making jokes its not even close to something like date a live in the not taking itself seriously department which was appreciable for that fact of what it was what youre mostly describing here is the premise of highschool dxd which is something i have little to no problem with nothing wrong with a pervert main character like golden boy or even a pervert that powers up from getting aroused like in amaenaideyo whats wrong with highschool dxd is that the author is extremely lazy and unthoughtful in writing the plot developments way too often things are happening by unlikely coincidence that never needed to and often enough those happenings are contradicted by later developments for instance in the first episode issei is handed a summoning circle during his date before he died later on you find out that the gremory group doesnt even work during the daytime that a different group handles daytime summonings you also find out that rias has her underlings attend to contracts while shes more of just the boss further raynare knows all about devils being unsurprised that they could bring issei back to life which makes it all the more ludicrous that she not only didnt leave him unresurrectable eg decapitated but that she also let him receive the summoning circle in the first place theres also the little bit about how rias coincidentally noticed issei earlier on for no real reason that was something that was easily fixable by having rias or akeno notice raynares fallen angel power as the series calls everything either naturally given that we find out later even humans are able to sense magic in dxd or by way of a barrierward shed undoubtedly have around the school follow the two of them out of suspicion and witness issei dying that wouldve also established why rias chose to resurrect a weakling like him in the first place before finding out how many pawns it would take because shed understand the fallen angels saw him as a threat and she also would feel some sense of responsibility for him becoming a devil which would explain why shes as apprehensive as she is about pursuing him romantically for so long i could go on with more examples but i dont know how much youve seen and id hate to risk spoiling even something as trashy as that if you keep your eyes out for plot holes and unlikely coincidences youre going to see many many more as it goes on the authors just uncreatively coopting a whole bunch of tropes from popular early manga and light novels and jamming them in without the slightest consideration for why the tropes worked in other stories and it makes for an absolute mess
anime,removed,i just want to bake cookies for kariu and drown her in em honestly that girl has to go through so much at least she gets some happy moments and in case i ever need a show to proof why women are the meaner gender i can just use this and you can also use it to show that women have it harder kinda sad that the anicharts already spoiled so much of the plot a few quick minuses visually unimpressive as of the time are spend either at home or at school the directing and animation are consistently well done but the plot doesnt offer many chances for memorable animation secondarily oga and ryo look a bit samey it took me an episode or so to keep them apart third too short it feels like they could have done an even better job with more episodes but there are also lots of pluses characters in an sol behaving intelligently and memefree kind of a novelty the plot unfolds without the protagonist always being in the center that is also very nice because their stories are strong enough to cover that and having the mc as a toned down not in the spotlight grey eminence makes it very enjoyable and relatable dont push for resolve and let others fight their own problems i liked the realism in that and thirdly the show is not only nostalgia inducing but also cathartic and healing its a beautiful to story to give strength to those who need it it had a very big impact on me
anime,removed,cautious op putting a spoiler tag on something thats over years old and which probably of anime fans have already seen haha
anime,removed,i dont know if im allowed to say this or not but subscomru have english subtitles but the site is in russian but still easy to navigate

anime,removed,i mean if that were the case they would work just as hard if not harder than american vas
anime,removed,in this situation i dont think a societyspecies that can only exist by killing innocent kids should in the case of fiends are they really innocent though the people who exhibit symptoms of the larmankrogeus syndrome are people who would traditionally be considered to be the bad eggs that go on to become serial killers sure they may not have done anything yet but when they possess the capability to devastate the entire village its reasonable to expect that the well being of the many outweighs that of the few in the case of karmic demons yes you could consider them to be innocent but most karmic demons end up killing themselves with their leaking power anyway however because they are incredibly destructive the society has people who cant control their powers killed to avoid the worst case scenario there should be any number of ways of dealing with fiends in theory there are many ways to deal with fiends the psycho buster for example doesnt trigger the death feedback in the person who uses it however the problem is that the fiends cantus stops nearly all of these fiends and karmic demons occur when the intense conditioning that the children are subjected to fails but the children who are conditioned to fear the trickster cats freeze up when they are attacked rather than becoming aggressive the trickster cats are more or less only effective when the conditioning hasnt outright failed but is in danger of doing so noted by how shun was able to slaughter the trickster cats that came after him easily but saki froze up when she was attacked and was only able to defend herself after the necklace that shun gave her blocked the first attack the death feedback is a means to stop people from using their cantus to kill each other intentionally or not not to stop people from killing each other altogether thats what the rest of the conditioning is for therefore it stands to reason that by using ones cantus to superheat the air knowing that it causes harm you would trigger the death feedback furthermore the fiend would be able to interfere with the attackers cantus creating the superheated air limiting its effects
anime,removed,outlaw motherfucking star probably the only thing i watched on toonami i already watched anime before i came to the states and when i got here i was already of the age where i discovered torrents so i didnt really have reason to watch the block but i kept coming back to toonami for that

anime,removed,i love how the show just stops tolerating his bullshit he was such an edgy little turd that a better protagonist came along beat him up and literally took away his plot armour and i was expecting the show to spend the rest of its airtime dancing around his ego
anime,removed,i completely agree with you there i think hirano has taken great inspiration from the truest and most authentic anime spongebob squarepants im sure many of you have not heard of this it is very underground and only those with real anime loving powers can handle it d so maybe you need to do some research into what makes a real anime fan bmx boy makks out

anime,removed,im gonna have to disagree on that i like beck but its an incredibly idealistic manga the entire premise is doing things for money is bad instead you should do things because of passion and love and friendship and that way nothing is impossible and you will overcome and adversity i mean ther music cames from their souls so hard that it almost makes people orgasm not even the queen were as beloved by their fan s of literally dead musicians coming back from the afterlife to tell them that they are destined to make great music makes it really hard to call beck realistic

anime,removed,dont quote me but the original mask man aka char azanable was a pedophilia and killed his purple haired friend
anime,removed,but fuck i really want to know are the lns translated yes vol alternatively this site also have all the translated novels where does the anime end or should i just start from the beginning the anime ends on vol however do not start on vol go back and read from the start while the anime is good it missed out a looooot of good content from the novels were talking plot points character development funny as fuck comedy world building tsunako artwork etc if you start from the beginning i promise it will be worth your while oh also some of the story is different between the lns and anime so uh unless you want to be confused start from the beginning
anime,removed,romances are my fav just shit taste i guess ¯ツ¯
anime,removed,i also guessed it was the teacher i dont know if anyone else predicted this but i also had an idea that the mc would save everyone but the killer would end up killing him as the substitute not exact but pretty close

anime,removed,it wasnt one sided i dont even
anime,removed,she is completely portrayed as a grade girl throughout the whole show if you dont find it weird to see fanservice there then cool whatever floats your boat she didnt develop into a year old she was stuck as a wandering snail in that same mentality from the day she died
anime,removed,yes ive finished every single episode i disagree with you completely she was always portrayed as a grader she may have had wisdom about certain things from being an abberation for the time she was around but she lived and died as a grader she never had experiences as a human past that
anime,removed,well not from death but hey
anime,removed,
anime,removed,it was deleted wouldnt you consider hachikuji being a ghost common knowledge though i mean people loosely talk about all the monogirls spirits all the time and it isnt flagged d
anime,removed,just curious why did you hide the last two titles im sure a majority of the people have already seen your name
anime,removed,mine is cory in the house
anime,removed,well to be fair celestial beings are commonly known for the being annoying
anime,removed,kumiko hibike euphonium
anime,removed,i dont think you realize this but no one is trying to argue if the average child could beat yugi re read the question posed by op its asking which anime protagonist would you be able to beat at their own game the argument is that with a good deck even in the era goatchaosyatagarasu lockteledad later yugi literally stands no chance not that an average player could beat him or not youre the one arguing for the sake of argument
anime,removed,keitaro urashima what the fuck who would feel jealous of keitaro hes a perennial failure he lives with some of the most bitchy arrogant and selfish women in existence he seems to spend most of his adult life being abused and then he even wound up marrying his biggest attacker settling into a nice comfortable life of domestic abuse about the only thing going for him is that he owns a pretty awesome inn that hes not even really allowed to use and got into todai
anime,removed,also he actually stayed relatively focused on one girl through most of the series recognized he wasnt being honest and chose someone at the end compare to tenchi or rito
anime,removed,literally the only thing i remember about hughes is that he diesitsrainingjpg how the hell did he beat scar one of the shows best developed characters i dont even know why i keep getting mad at these contests also fuck archer and rip hisoka
anime,removed,i know youre mentally challenged but please i clearly said pedophilia does not mean child abuse ahhthis is a waste of energy carry on with you year old drawn kiddie porn or whatever gets your sick ass off im going to bed
anime,removed,im not the one who knows what toddlercon is and who feels the need to correct someone who doesnt know what year old drawn kiddie porn is lol please just walk in your nearest police station and hand yourself in along with your pcyoull just make everyones job easier
anime,removed,sure youll get to share that with that pedo subway guy who got caught last year your future cellmate and you really clicked on year old kiddie porn just to confirm haha i didnt know the shit existed give up alreadyyoure embarassing yourself and your pedo clique

anime,removed,so i just finished watching rezero kara hajimeru isekai seikatsu and i cant help but hope for a second season while i dont think its as good as people where making out to be it is good specially the voice acting and face animations s though i am glad it ended before the whole whos rem thing also rem is the best girl
anime,removed,i personally view that more as selfdefense hence why i said it
anime,removed,i mean that person distorted what i said and insulted someone when i was kid we were all taught that once someone betrays your trust theyve lost all ability or right to be trusted again unless they work to reearn it which isnt easy obviously if somone insults or lies about someone the other person wont ever want to have anything to do with them why would they i followed what i was taught as a kid im pretty confident we all did decades ago additionally i dont feel replying with the truth based on someones behavior is an insult but i can see the argument for it being one apologies for that though i stand by my words
anime,removed,instagramcomakumapress im designing anime inspired pins so if youre into anime and enamel pins you should check out my instagram and shop 🐰
anime,removed,sselector infected wixoss
anime,removed,doesnt he wind up getting murdered in the end also im pretty sure hes related to at least one or two of the girls in his harem so
anime,removed,im hoping she gets more screen time outside of the lewd portions as it feels she gets overshadowed the most amongst the girls even kazuma summed it up pretty well in the ova
anime,removed,while not exactly necessary i did think that the second half was really fucking clever s the way that l beats light from beyond the grave throwing him one final curveball that he never could have predicted near was really in spirit with the show l won by planning outside of the box by playing dirty and light was too obsessed with his kill l and i win mentality that he couldnt predict it little did he realise that staying alive was never one of ls victory conditions

anime,removed,sounds a bit like dragon ball it was meant to end after the death of frieza
anime,removed,and youre calling me the one with shit taste
anime,removed,also to take into the fact the novel series didnt start as a harlem saito is actually quite monogamous towards louise in volume we started getting tifa and tabasa charlotte who was just plainly treated him better and won most readers hearts
anime,removed,where do you enjoy your stuff from i tend to go to manga panda but id like to find alternate site too
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i read online i read chinese webnovels on wuxiaworld and most japanese ln on bakatsuki novels are quickly becoming one of my favorites since it requires your own imagination to picture how things go about they describe the events but picturing them in your head has a much longer lasting impression
anime,removed,good thing fav aka the lovechild of kyubey and monokuma is ball shaped so stuff like this could be made kyubey being slaughtered on mass was one of the only good parts about madoka magica rebellion imo
anime,removed,after reading that now i want an anime which is just fav and kyubei arguing over whos the better mahou shoujo torturer
anime,removed,if thats what youre into check out this
anime,removed,chinese cartoons
anime,removed,i always recommend madoka magica since your just starting out and seem to like be in the shounen action phase attack on titan sounds like a fitting recommendation one punch man as well
anime,removed,ye switched to gogoanime
anime,removed,narcissistegomanic freaking the fuck out when he loses at the end or finally has the bad guys catch up to him like the end of pyscho pass and death note
anime,removed,keep watching and find out no use telling you the answer when the show does it in due time
anime,removed,katanagatari hyping up a massive fight then cutting away and showing something else for an entire episode then cutting back at the end to the two main characters talking about how amazing and dramatic that big fight was
anime,removed,you should go back and read the reaction threads we seriously thought that people would die one guy even made a chart for how everyone would end
anime,removed,anime with a lot of kisses and no not sakura trick
anime,removed,obviously the dio interruption
anime,removed,why bother replying if youre not even reading a fucking line op
anime,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
anime,removed,when that chick dies in grave of fireflies
anime,removed,how do i cure autistic i have that dieseas
anime,removed,you should take a look a eric brothers mom and erens mom
anime,removed,it likes when lolis get killed like with madoka
anime,removed,sorry to say but if you read the manga it turns into something more
anime,removed,s if people die in her dreams they die in real life she also controls what happens in her dreams
anime,removed,
anime,removed,thats the point was referring to the whole shelter music video thing that happened with the mods
anime,removed,i dont think you understand the joke the mods removed shelter posts when it first started circulating because they didnt agree that it counted as anime was a simple jab at that incident
anime,removed,lol i was searching for the reply a glorious shitstorm will arrive as they adapt vol ending
anime,removed,ive heard of this anime before but upon asking are there any english sub torrents around a friend told me that it was strictly in korean as in the english dub sucks ass in quality
anime,removed,ayase shouldved won fuckyou
anime,removed,she fucked it up for herself
anime,removed,its obviously uuexkull
anime,removed,well that high school was already very unconventional due to it being a puppet school of gaia i can totally imagine akane or some other gaia higherup ordering kazamatsuri academy to have really attractive uniforms in order to attract more students and positive attention both for good pr purposes and to look for gaias mamonotsukai recruits
anime,removed,yeah thats most likely it however with cross ange as of episode everything makes sense to me and not in the no rules way of kill la kill i recall a few things off in the late episodes especially the famous tusk one but on the whole it seemed consistent in its own rules for episode to everything holds pretty well i find even when being critical s norma are dangerous to their society since they cancel out magic and everything works with it sending them to a remote prison makes sense they arm the norma to fight against the dragons but their mechs have too little fuel so they cant leave and use them against humans the airships are piloted with mana so the norma cant use them to leave anges bitchiness makes perfect sense considering who she is and what she went through the hate from hilda rosalie and chris makes sense salias frustration with how she can handle the team makes sense and so on so forth in cross anges case for me its not a well theres no rule to the show so anything goes and more everything makes sense in context and i cant find anything to nitpick about
anime,removed,its the most popular reason by far though it triggered all of the closet homophobes who get grossed out by seeing gay behavior depicted nonsarcastically
anime,removed,xd i have xd been xd watching i xd was xd

anime,removed,nobodys arguing youre just the local douche who thinks people will think hes all mature and shit
anime,removed,in my opinion i think bebop ended alright it wasnt great it wasnt bad it was just okay it did what we wanted to see spike finally killing vicious and not leaving anything behind where there could possibly be huge loose ends
anime,removed,of course they will they have to face and beat nekoma in the finals after all
anime,removed,it showed them getting consumed by the same type of portal thing weve seen numerous times before if you watch carefully you can see that althought that thing looks similar from the truths black tentaclearms is not quite the same
anime,removed,nooooooooooooooooo
anime,removed,animania free from app store and playbox hd from the web

anime,removed,he is also implied to be king gaiseric a man who ruled a whole continent a thousand years ago
anime,removed,you should get a vpn and keep doing what you were doing
anime,removed,and since torrents were my way to go to get anime vpn for torrents vpn crunchyroll for anime in any country in high quality and with no viruses i personally use httpswwwprivateinternetaccesscom for my vpn ymmv so do your own research first
anime,removed,not sure if sarcastic or not
anime,removed,i didnt like much for the first seven episodes or so the main problems were that there was a lot of fanservice mashiro an autistic person used mainly as a clown and the plot focused too much on sorata which i coulnd not relate with at all but after that the fanservice lessened or stopped and mashiro had proper character development ryuunosuke was also properly introduced and he was basically me anime version to top it off it had the single moment that i disagreed with the show the most in all anime when s sorata tried to prevent mashiro from cooking i just felt that mashiro ought to try to do something else so she could live independently however i could not mount a logical argument against that and ideas that i find the most interesting are the ones that i deeply disagree but could not properly argue against
anime,removed,harambe
anime,removed,dont be discouraged by anime touman hes so much better character than the anime portrais him to be also if this is your first time reading lns i highly recommend that you read then skip to then and so on ps you dont need to read because the anime almost perfectly adapted them except the angel fall arc
anime,removed,its based on nisio isins author of monogatari series katanagatari medaka box death note another note among others debut novel and series the novel is about a university student who together with his genius autistic friend travels to an island populated by only ten people which includes five geniuses when someone gets murdered the protagonist must find out who did it so they can leave the island the reason why everyone is so hyped up is that even though the zaregoto novel series is composed of nisios first novels its considered his best work by a lot of his fans
anime,removed,op is such a faggot
anime,removed,the animator died of a s sheer heart attack
anime,removed,that kind of logic means you just hate the whole actionadventure story are you really that idiot
anime,removed,torrent
anime,removed,latest translated novel is ln that was in december of and it was also quite short it also ends on a pretty troll cliffhanger which makes me wish that the project was still active as of right now its unclear if the translators are working on it or if theyve disappeared heck its unclear who the translators even are outside of bakatsuki which isnt really specific as its meant to be a hub for ln translations i too would like some more tokyo ravens natsume came across as one of the most attractive female characters ive seen in anime really well designed and developed too
anime,removed,you should never torrent big hollywood movies without a vpn and its good to read torrentfreakcom to stay informed on torrent piracy issues
anime,removed,as you have found out you can never torrent big hollywood movies without a vpn but if you have a vpn that take anonymity seriously then you a fine your connection is end to end encrypted aka your isp or anyone else cant see anything
anime,removed,the problem is many people dont understand how torrenting works bittorrent is not anonymous you are publicly asking does anyone have the hunger games well the movie studios are on bittorrent too they record your ip address send it to the isp saying that whoever is using that ip is pirating our movie
anime,removed,i took a grab of plastic memories op then sent it over to which upscales and enhances the image via machine learningsome advanced algorithm personally didnt find plames ending all that tear jerking compared to ab and others and the silence was quite awkward but anyway isla is still lovable hence this post enjoy

anime,removed,im horrible for expecting some heavily injured dude laying in a hospital bed man the mindfulness of ceiling obstacles must be strong with this one
anime,removed,im going down my list by score to pick out ones i know have good redemptions imo op if youre looking for shows to watch ill recommend specific ones lots of battle shounen have redemptions that range from great to awful
anime,removed,im ok with dying by rem naked butt
anime,removed,no problem out of curiosity what problems did you have with touma i quite liked him in the anime though the ln portrays him much better also go to rtoarumajutsunoindex and look at the top stickied post to find the novels since direct torrent links are banned on this sub
anime,removed,onodera fans were going apeshit
anime,removed,lmao chitoge well deserved onodera lyfe
anime,removed,salty onodera
anime,removed,so did anyone pick up on the fact that kotoris parents were supposedly heavily injured or died in that car accident but in episode her mom looked okay
anime,removed,i wonder how the anime community will react to the result so i guess that means soma doesnt win after all how id react to it considering soma and his dad had their moment and him literally promising not to lose to anyone else until their next fight id say its just annoyingdumb
anime,removed,this episode really did well and the group is complete the story behind the years were very well thought out imo at first sight from the previous episodes you would think that the their story is just a very simple dramainducing plot device but when revealed it was actually a bit more complex but still easy to understand and relate to speaking of complex i can really feel that the characterization of the third years were really well thought out too kanan from being the cheerful one turning into the angsty one mari from the angsty one turning into a pushy and cheerful facade type dia from being the chikalike character turning into an anti school idol type and maybe somehow a neutral type the change of their characterization is really a nice touch for me since its like seeing the two sides of the same coin people change very easily with a given situation and because of the complex year story the rewatch value of this series skyrocketed for me ill definitely rewatch this after it airs because i want to see how the years act given that i already know what happened to their past the third years story also became a lot more interesting since it involved mari going abroad to study doesnt it sound familiar s yes it sounds like the kotori arc in season s it felt like sunrise is saying this couldve actually happened in the previous one and it really made me think what couldve happened if things didnt go well i want a you arc though shes my favorite but things arent going well for her everyone already got the spotlight at some point except her so i hope she gets her own too s and the chikayou ship isnt doing so well damn it riko aaaand the hug scene was really well placed oh god i almost cried it even made more impact because the previous episode mari did the same thing and got rejected i thought it was stupid sorry but when they revealed that kanan did the same thing when they are young gave it a whole different meaning feels
anime,removed,yeah the ending with her looking at the cake was like shooting a arrow through every single onondera fans heat lul shes such a doormat chitoge masterrace
anime,removed,this route is probably going to end in salvation
anime,removed,glad to see shitoge on that list pretty much ruined nisekoi for me after chapters or so then skipped to the final few chaps and thank god i didnt bother with the rest marika is far and away best girl to the point of contention though an ending with onodera wouldve been acceptable too
anime,removed,shouldnt he cut off one of his arms too to perfect the cosplay
anime,removed,i have some form of theory based on anime with somewhat similar tech and gizmos now first lets compare brynhildr in the darkness escaped lab experiments nothing special but what intrigues me is this crystal i keep seeing that seems to be some kind of temporary battery now in brynhildr they had capsules with alien worms inside eventually when they used too much magics the alien worm would burst out of the capsule and start eating them its just an opinion but i feel these crystals have a similar meaning to these capsules now i will compare to cross ange a rondo of dragons and angels in this anime the cast was forced to fight dragons until they eventually spoilers the dragons turned out to be good one chick among the cast turned out to be a long lost kidnapped dragon child and well the whole world was false thanks to a douche bag its similar to this scenario as it seems the unknown being an enemy is false and the world is false its only speculation though so dont take my word on it
anime,removed,and yet chitoge won
anime,removed,yuki yuna is a hero pretty much s for now who knows where the shuten douji plotline from the ln will go httpimgurcomfmzwcnw sure doesnt scream hero to me
anime,removed,code geass reference yeah it kinda killed the climax of the finale
anime,removed,its a transformation gon goes through during the chimera ant arc its not really that big a spoiler though
anime,removed,also hayamas first sword before it turned into the rapier was very reminiscent of archers swords in fsn he also also voiced by archer and has the same hair color and skin tone as archer ive said it a thousand times before because of the many parallels but shokugeki no soma is basically just shirou goes to cooking school

anime,removed,i think alucard was raped also by some priest

anime,removed,the stand users in part are overwhelmingly normal suburban japanese people who happen to have stands yeah they get a little drunk with power when they find out they basically have a superpower but then they mellow out once they realize theyre not such hot shit after all for the real brutal users we have part where everyone including the main cast are part of the mafioso

anime,removed,wait who i havent heard of this yet haha is it like aot
anime,removed,who tf are these characters ohs theyre deaddefeated now guess they werent important its still mindboggling how much plot they tried to cram into the last few episodes
anime,removed,oh i just wanted to know who i dont get anything when i search for the series
anime,removed,
anime,removed,you have to admit that toothbrush scene was hot
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,who is rem
anime,removed,pizza mozzarella
anime,removed,emilia and who
anime,removed,from what i remember the man girl machi wanted to move to the local town and assimilate into their society however she had severe crippling social anxiety problems which is a common joke throughout the series in the final episode the bear natsu and the others who live with her at the rural shrine basically tell her that she doesnt need to bother to try and be happy and achieve her goals to better herself and that she could just stay in the shrine where she will never have to leave anywhere ever at all shes practically mindbroken and delusional at this point and they all laugh and smile as shes basically succumbing to living her life as a hermit who will never interact with others having her dreams crushed in the process what makes it all worse is that after the credits shes shown to have mentally regressed to that of a toddler being completely convinced that the bullshit that shes been fed is true and is falsely lulled into a sense of security and happiness im sure theres more to it but thats what i recall
anime,removed,from what ive seen the manga is usually significantly more graphic in terms of gore
anime,removed,i think that may have been a good choice for the anime i read the scene in the manga and seeing s subaru begging to die while his guts are spilling out of his body made me seriously dislike rem i know everyone thinks shes best girl but damn its hard to get that image out of my head
anime,removed,whos the chick with the blue hair
anime,removed,the episode of kabaneri of the iron fortress where horobi the right hand of biba converted into some oily stuff and fired a fucking laser into the city destroying it entirely because fuck that particular city and then the fucking scientific fucking pulled a fucking minigun out of nowhere and began shooting it was just a utter mess i liked kabaneri but fuck this particular episode
anime,removed,agreed maybe maybe wouldve worked with a cour runtime but with only episodes just felt rushed and outta nowhere saddest part for me was s guitar girl disappearing
anime,removed,for some reason i cant remember the blue haired gal
anime,removed,that is what happens in the ln as far as i heard but the anime shows nothing of this and none of the situations that result from this get better with the thought of he totally knew theyre still stupid
anime,removed,warning wall of text incoming episode of akuma no riddle marks the second time in my life i dropped a show purely out of spite now dont get me wrong that show was terrible all the way through i was lured into it by the shoujoai tag and stuck around because despite the fact that it was complete garbage because fuck it the main characters might kiss eventually episode though no absolutely not i can enjoy terrible shows but i still have fucking standards you have to draw the line somewhere and episode was my line if you havent heard of the show before its basically your run of the mill deathgame battle show think mirai nikki this one stars a way lamer pink haired girl whos put into a classroom full of assassins that earn a genie wish if they kill her but the one with blue hair realizes she wants to fuck pink haired girl more than she wants that genie wish and becomes her bodyguard instead so follows a bunch of idiots trying desperately to seem cool while failing to kill an unarmed teenage girl while they themselves are armed with all manner of knives poison and fucking actual realass guns episode is the requisite beach episode but instead of a normal beach its an indoor beach thats built into the school they are at because uhhh yeah now why would our resident murder magnet agree to go on this trip with like people that want her dead good question but not the best question why would she decide to change in the same room as all of them close but no cigar no the best question of them all though is why is todays villain such an absolute fucking idiot while in said changing room she ambushes our hero not with like a knife or anything sensible but with a passcode locked bomb collar the code to which has been hidden around the poolbeach in the form of four playing cards they are all hidden in stupid places but that isnt that important no what is important is the monologue she goes on for the rest of the episode where she not only reveals the location of all of the cards but also dumps her completely fucking ridiculous backstory and absolutely incomprehensible motivations you thought kabaneris biba has weird reasons to kill people you havent even started down the rabbit hole friend within this bullshit diatribe she reveals the following facts about herself she has a genetic disorder that makes her literally immortal as in she does not age she doesnt seem to get ill she can only die if she is killed recognize briefly that this is the single best version of immortality that anyone could ever be given then recognize very quickly that the writers of this episode never came to that same realization also its important to note that everyone else up to this point has not had a straight up superpower so this comes way out of left field that she is intending on using her genie wish to get the illuminati to science into existence a cure for her curse of immortality so that she can grow old and fall apart and die in pain thats not me saying this this is what she wants to be old and die of heart failure or something that the entire reason shes so sour about living forever is because a boyfriend she had in like the realized that she would stay looking forever and decided to break up with her because it gave him the heebiejeebies after like years of them being together finally that despite apparently knowing how to kill people with ease due to hundreds of years of assassin training she is still so incompetent and so stupid that shes never considered just killing herself she isnt indestructible she just doesnt age she doesnt even have superhuman regeneration or anything it wouldnt even be hard now considering the above information we all know the heroes figure out the code and live well the above information and the fact she basically just comes out and tells them what it is when she goes on like a minute sobfest about the exact date her boyfriend was born and how he was born exactly days before her and that its the most important collection of four numbers in her entire life or some shit now whatever this is all stupid real stupid but i kept watching because im not a quitter i could handle this barely just barely but i could handle it it wasnt until after she fails like a dipshit and is walking away into the sunset like shes fucking bruce banner or something that i lost my shit as she walks off one of the idiots shes leaving behind asks her how old are you really and she says i kid you not i dont know i forgot forgot forgot bitch just count backwards whats wrong with you you forgot yeah i forget my age occasionally too but you know what i do i do the fucking math oh did you forgot your birthday too you idiot what about the birthday of the dude you just complained about for fucking minutes you know the one whos birthday is literally a single yeardays difference from yours no you forgot sure alright fine fuck that fuck that line fuck that character fuck that entire show fuck the fact that after episodes in they barely even had a single hint that girls were gonna start kissing anytime soon and listed that shit as shoujoai to trick me into watching it that shit isnt right it just isnt right
anime,removed,oreimo of all things with sp ruris meltdown when she gets dropped for kirino in the end super great voice acting
anime,removed,i like the animation and music too but i think they didnt have enough budget for the animation since there are a lot still frames the character design reminds me of ao haru ride also it leaves a bittersweet aftertaste every single time i watch it always so sad yet still has that small gleam of hope a funny romcom one im watching is hatsukoi monster which has a great ending song alsothis is shounen anime but handakun will give you a good laugh ps i hope rem comes back
anime,removed,agreed but finally he realizes and for that cheers on team chitoge
anime,removed,monster musume trust me httpsislimgfdnyttjpg
anime,removed,prayers wont help him
anime,removed,hard question im guessing l from death note never heard of anyone disliking him maybe wanting kira to win but never disliking l
anime,removed,angel beats
anime,removed,angel beats
anime,removed,if im not wrong angel beats
anime,removed,maybe because everyone forgot about her
anime,removed,whats with the ram recolor her hair is pink not blue
anime,removed,s he deserved a better death or ending
anime,removed,yeah the reason i want to use crunchyroll is because i have used kissanime and ryuanime to watch anime but i feel bad for developers so i wanna give something back to them
anime,removed,to be fair he has lost times to his dad yes he is a pretty damn good chef and technically lost in the secret shokugeki at camp also he didnt even come top of the autumn election prelims which i sort of expected considering he seemed pretty op a part of me was convinced they would have him score however i can see where youre coming from with this
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,not against kizaru aokiji akainu kuma candy and lots more pretty sure he has no chance of winning in one on one fight against doflamingo i dont think he can win against the almighty kaidou luffy isnt the strongest in one piece
anime,removed,being called a pedophile because you watched a show where flat girls kisses is a bit extreme i think
anime,removed,he dies like every episodes he doesnt revive and keep on like some immortal but is sent back in time to try again its a neat mechanic for a show that makes it like a video game with spawn points but considering how often he fails or makes things worse while slowly losing it its pretty far from being a plot armor his plot armor if anything is being saved by people who are actually very powerful and being healed from near mortal wounds after managing to eke out a win
anime,removed,nope she is still alive
anime,removed,who is she
anime,removed,i legit teared up when he died
anime,removed,whos the character on the right
anime,removed,i rarely see someone who dislikes him envy does chitogheh
anime,removed,i was really torn on twcfm there were some things i loved and some things i hated its a bad introduction to the lupin iii series though twcfm and the jigens gravestone movie are sort of the darker and edgier spinoffs from the main series and the main series ranges wildly from oceans heists to mildly perverted fanservice to silly slapstick involving aliens dragons and vampires lupin iii is all over the place and theres no continuity whatsoever but thats kind of its charm so i think twcfm was at its best when it was episodic and just focusing on the heroines cool exploits and her interactions with the guys fujiko is supposed to be a sexy independent woman with a mysterious past and i actually did not like that the show was attempting to give her an backstory of abuse and manipulation s although in the end those were false memories oscar was also a terrible character isnt it time we moved past the depraved homosexual trope the edginess was a nice throwback to the original series though the series was muuuuuuch goofier i like that goemon has gone from being a character with no personality to being an awkward dork the darker take on zenigata was interesting since im used to him being such a silly character and like you said the art and animation were gorgeous the writer and director are feminists so you can also find a lot of feminist symbolism and themes hidden in there if youre interested in lupin iii theres so much accumulated canon that you can kinda pick the tone and characterizations that you like best for movies the castle of cagliostro and the plot of the fuuma clan are very good and they definitely lean towards a kinder and gentler tone daisuke jigens gravestone goes for a darker cooler atmosphere and apart from one really stupid and offensive scene its a lot of fun the lupin iii series was also good like twcfm they experimented with a continuous story instead of episodic adventures but this time it actually worked pretty well the series is the one that everyone knows and while its a bit silly for my tastes the adult swim dub is hilarious and full of wall breaking and intentionally terrible foreign accents
anime,removed,she is the mc though also she never ends up with him afaik
anime,removed,arima ylia hes a crybaby s his mom died she used to abuse him and he said an unfavorable thing as his last words to her but his inability to play is a reaction to those circumstances that is less than relatable and not very believable as a result stack on top of that the fact that hes got so many women practically chomping at the bit for him it just makes me hate him even more i think i wouldve liked the show better had his character been more hardened by his experiences rather than so damn melodramatic i found the show emotionally exhausting because of that and it didnt leave enough emotional response for the end which is what this show was about
anime,removed,fucking best girl right here bois only a true best girl would eliminate the competition by forcing the other one into a game of twister
anime,removed,u pedophiles u all sicko disguuuuustiiiing or something like that well i do agree maybe s maybe not
anime,removed,body designed to be fully recyclable and a garbage collector remember what happened in plastic memories
anime,removed,thats a weird way to spell cory in the house
anime,removed,there were the scenes in ishbal he had his serious moments and took risks just like everyone else but what set him apart is that he was almost completely selfless the humor and attitude make him more likeable on top of that and poetically its his own selflessness s comes back to bite him in the end if thats not a stellar reason to love a character i dont know what is though i do agree s had he lasted longer we would need to see extra character development from him
anime,removed,
anime,removed,i specialize to frequently reposted you have bean visited by so with anime memes i am not very familiar excuse my rational shitpost take this random google image of as a token of my apology
anime,removed,whos rem
anime,removed,
anime,removed,first of all id like to say that im not a native english speaker so some of the sentences or their structure may not make sense i have two questions why do people like senjougahara so much i personally couldnt stand her until nowim currently at the last arc of second season s shes sadistic always says something savage to most people shes like the epitome of a fictional character that wouldnt be able to exist in real life person in a normally functioning society maybe ive missed something about why shes like that hell the first time she met araragi i was like what the fuckthe whole scissors thing also do people like araragi koyomi himself i cant stand his s people say that some of the perverted stuff adds charm to the show but why does he have to be such a fucking perverted lolicon paedophile shithead when i start to like him he does something like breast groping of girls that arent named senjougahara and i start to despise him people always praise the fan service of this show but to me this is bullshit
anime,removed,where can i watch kabaneri of the iron fortress online i cant find it in crunchyroll and anime tofu so please recommend a website that i can watch it on ps it should have the dubbed version too
anime,removed,whos remplease dont kill meim a rem fan as well

anime,removed,can someone explain what we are supposed to take away from the film centimeters per second what was the main messagetheme i understand that its about love but what about love s sometimes you have to move on also s takaki and akari even separate in the first place couldnt they just have kept in contact with one another and eventually met up when they were adults
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,
anime,removed,here is a link to the section in the novel that explains it read the section under pages spoilers for episode

anime,removed,shame that all we will ever get is the golden age arc i want lost children and jill or the rickert griffith slap gloriously animated
anime,removed,ho sad it really should
anime,removed,season was much better but season was still awesome to see more hei even with what happened to him he was still kicking just as much ass it was cool to see to see him as the black reaper we heard about during heavens war i also actually liked the relationship between him and suou it reminded me of the movie the professional and leon and matilda the whole training a young girl to be an assassin thing and of corse it was nice to see a continuation of hei trying to make it work with yin though i do agree like i said season was way better oh yeah the ovas were frikking awesome though i enjoyed the ovas just as much as season honestly
anime,removed,i will be original here i always end my sentence with a
anime,removed,comment removed for now getting here late but could you throw tags around the meruemkyubey part no idea about the former but it could definitely be considered spoiler for the latters show
anime,removed,this was reported for spoilers ive temporarily removed the comment please review it and add any spoiler tags that might be necessary then reply to me so i can reinstate your comment thanks
anime,removed,not to mention the manga still has hilarious jokes chapters into it just this last chapter had me laughing my ass off with s zakiyamasan
anime,removed,usagi drop when it was a big deal for daikichi to change from his one position to the other because of rin it was strange because work should have come first
anime,removed,we did though there was development all the way through the second season unless are you one of those people that thinks s no kiss no development
anime,removed,removed for not having a title in your spoiler tag this is something we have to enforce rather strictly especially seeing as your tag doesnt have to do with the three series you mentioned please add an appropriate title and let me know so i can reapprove it
anime,removed,already seen it
anime,removed,not really theres a difference between fighting and winning and showing them whos boss eg luffy vs most villains compared to when he used conquerers haki on fishman island

anime,removed,i guess part of the fight with lucifer in fits
anime,removed,sao a ghibli fim except princess mononoke a nonghibli fim not named akira or ghost in the shell an old anime shitobako a nostalgia show a hentai legend of the galactic heroes an anime where you can argue about who is best girl
anime,removed,i pmd it to you
anime,removed,most of the criticism for it ive encountered was people hating on where they took homuras character i was somewhat put off by it too until i came to see it as the accumulation of her total obsession with madoka who shed spent uncountable time resets to keep her alive only for madoka to take things out of her hands and remove herself madoka was saved but homura still couldnt be with her which fueled her tip into a far extreme attempt to keep her
anime,removed,until you watch
anime,removed,downer ending spoilers
anime,removed,already reach where he was found by his mother
anime,removed,now upload it to bakabt so we can all enjoy it please

anime,removed,yeah you clearly
anime,removed,my comment doesnt say everyones dumb and im not but hey guess it has just rooted out another one to add to the list of dumb people
anime,removed,even thenkamina never really died

anime,removed,which tags is that on this sub which i am viewing in reddit sync also not knowing that i bet you also didnt know that adachi is the killer
anime,removed,so true i dont mind it but then again the show really didnt have to many flaws considering it was prologue either way the critisism was more of just is this right is she dead spoiler spoiler spoiler and best girl haha
anime,removed,boku no pico
anime,removed,so that makes usami s rem
anime,removed,wasnt that kind of the point of the show
anime,removed,
anime,removed,homunculus inc
anime,removed,the bad guy is clothes i love it
anime,removed,things that died faster than the whos rem meme
anime,removed,zero is the story of kritsigu and the other time saber came to fuyuki city also the fire that shirou was in as a kid not spoilers cause its in the first episode
anime,removed,sorry got it from an rmanga thread from a while back
anime,removed,the episode where everyone thought kagura had died had me laughing so hard omg i need to rewatch it again nearly peed myself from the comedy
anime,removed,disgusting unpleasant thing by a girl u saw in an anime honestly the most disgusting female character ive seen in anime is from shimoneta she has been sexually repressed for her entire life and has been shut away from any encounter with something that even resembles romance or sex and doesnt know what to do with her feelings for mc she reaches a reaches a point of yandere crazy up to the point where she forces the mc to drink her love nectar aka her vaginal orgasm fluids or whatever you want to call it or hides them into cookies for him to eat she also tries to sexually assault him him several times and tries to put a vacuum cleaner on the guys hose to suck out his love fluids shimoneta is a weird show but even for a show like shimoneta anna is just insanely creepy is one of the milder scenes and it already freaks me out to no end i challenge anyone to find someone more repulsive or creepy than her
anime,removed,kidney in ptbr is rim
anime,removed,i always recommend rewatching the first series before rebellion the time through feels very different as your attention is completed shifted to homura and theres numerous bits of foreshadowing and new meaning added to dialogue
anime,removed,yea i mean its pretty tough for her especially when she starts thinking kou only likes her as a replacement for wakaba the feels
anime,removed,well i saw her torture the shit out of subaru while he was crying so that left an impression although the brigade is now gonna say that she wasnt developed as much then
anime,removed,one piece when going merry says it still wanted to continue the journey with the straw hats when ace dies senor pink flash back etc
anime,removed,shigechis awkward but not a bad guy cant wait to see his growth at the end of the season
anime,removed,the only thing that worries me is after the previous episode all the people familiar with the source said now this subaru becoming just another generic light novel hero is the real rezero which means either the show is fundamentally changing its tone characters and themes or a good number of source readers just dont grasp what the work is doing and trying to do which with all the people who kept saying subaru dindu nuffin wrong towards emilia julius et al makes me think it could be as you say that the work wont betray what it seemed to be
anime,removed,youll find out in weeks
anime,removed,more weeks to finally see kira in action hyped
anime,removed,dios motivation isnt i want to conquer the world dios motivation is more akin to humans are scum and ill use any means i can to rise above them in part its revealed that he was searching for a way to obtain heaven
anime,removed,to be fair i think it can fit to one episode fine a lot of it will flow better in animation it may get a bit lengthy when she goes to the mall with joseph koichi achtung baby etc but i have faith if i dont have faith why am i here lol
anime,removed,its been confirmed well get the novels animated which take place after the canon story ended this winter which means well the the final fight sometimes this autumn my prediction anime will end at then theyll animate the books and extra content
anime,removed,i should finish this i was watching the episodes as they aired and just stopped halfway through i cant remember the episode number but it was when s they introduced the american group i didnt dislike the show but the people i knew that were watching it stopped watching so i had no motivation to continue
anime,removed,the reaction to the last rezero episode has me upset spoilers for episode obviously i know a lot of people in the subreddit are being hyperbolic for comedic purposes but there are a lot of people in the fandom who in sincerity hate subarus decision to reject rems confession you can find most of these types of people on youtube of course i usually wouldnt mind the opinions of youtube commenters harmless though toxic as they are however this ideology of screw subaru has spread to my inner circle which makes me irrationally angry i just need to vent that rems reason for being smitten with subaru is the same as subarus reason for being smitten with emilia however his reason is stupid but rems confession is heartfelt and pure subaru rejects rem for the same reason emilia rejects subaru they both feel that the admirer dont know the real them and are placing them on a pedestal emilia is justified in doing this but somehow subaru is being an idiot i dont want to sound like a negative nigel but the hypocrisy of some rezero fans will never cease to amaze me i know that when subaru was doing it to emilia that he was being a lot more pathetic however the motives behind the actions are basically the same you saved me so i am willing to die for you just to see you smile i want to be by your side but because its everyones best girl saying it its adorable and justified not saying that the confession wasnt adorable so please dont crucify me i love rem but nagatsuki is an understated genius for using her confession as a method to expose the fact that people are willing to look past rems unjustified love simply because she is purposefully made to be a waifu figure sigh that turned out to be rantier than expected i just hate that people are posting fuck emilia or subaru is the worst or any derivative thereof all over the internet
anime,removed,i love that they reordered things a bit and gave us some backstory on yatori and ikta not only that but we got to see how life with iktas parents and teacher was i think this flashback is from ln correct me if im wrong but i think it works so well at this point in the narrative we get to see more into the workings of how yatori and ikta think which should make next episodes important scene a lot more understandable
anime,removed,i think episode has elevated emilia to the position of best girl in my book rems a great girl but emilias actions i find to be heartwarming subaru is the clingy manservant who was screaming at her a few episodes ago and she takes him in anyway rem loves this subaru that she has placed on a pedestal and does what she does because of this image she has created of him in her mind emilia knows the true subaru the selfish subaru and cares for him anyway she takes him in even though he is no longer under her jurisdiction thank you for being supportive of emilia and not another person who repeats the mantra of fuck emilia after episode
anime,removed,s from the synopsis i made the mistake of reading this appears significantly later in that series as part of novel im guessing madhouse thought itd be better here to help the viewer better understand yattoris and itkas bond rather than saving it for a hypothetical season unless this turns out to be a cour show in which case im not sure
anime,removed,this week has been an interesting one for me been watching donald trump litterally explain nothing about nothing i listened to hilliary say she is going raise taxes on the middle class by accident still funny i finished cross ange dubbed and even though its the time its still werf im starting gundam thunderbolt dubbed d i was commanded by the peer of geass to order all of code geass on boy ray the new rainbow seige mad favella isholy shit its a cluster fuck the ending nesekoi isget the fuck out bleachwhy is rukia captain she cant even beat her own brother kubo wtf is this shit started reading the cooking wars manga its so werf lol alcohol can make you say the wrong thing at the right time which may in inadvertently lead to sex its been a funny and interesting week for me ps see you guys in the toonami sub tommororw night for the show
anime,removed,like alot of people i was put off this series thinking it was going to be generic ln love harem i mean ikta does have a harem of milfs
anime,removed,prepare for the finale im just preparing my swords to murder some witch cult members s rem is be gone coz of a witch
anime,removed,
anime,removed,the eyes are a mystery at this point youll find out more about them later the entity that keeps saving casca is the demon fetus casca was pregnant when the eclipse happened the fetus was partially corrupted during those events and afterwards casca miscarried and the fetus vanished since then it has appeared near guts several times if youll recall the earlier episode it brought him the warning that casca was in danger it also consistently protects casca from any evil spirits summoned by her brand
anime,removed,spoilers short synopsis of the entire season souma wins the first match of the autumn election then loses in the finals threeways to spice guy intesnecreepy guy and comes in a tie for second with intense guy inspired to be a better cook and create his own identity own cooking all students ending their first year have to do externships at established restaurants around the worldand japan to help improve and leave something behind with the restaurant souma helps fix a dying restaurant then helps out at the chef from first season he had a shokugeki with that is opening a french restaurant he sucks and almost gets cut he improves and never sleeps then comes up with an amazing signature dish and its on the menu at the restaurant all the main characters more or less succeed in their externships and are now treated as secondyears boom shokugeki cliffhanger at the last minute with souma upperclassmen

anime,removed,shinjimug
anime,removed,heat death of the universe no magical girls to save us

anime,removed,i havent watched akame ga kill and i know of the characters died
anime,removed,i think my favorite part of this series is how the body improvement club immediately accepts mob into their group and they train him like a brother even though hes weak and he falls behind they only have encouragement and warmth for mob
anime,removed,nearly all of them
anime,removed,comewithmeifyouwanttobebestgirl
anime,removed,nisekoi
anime,removed,this is nothing wait for tsumugi to ask about her mother then youre gonna cry
anime,removed,what an awful ending too i understand it was more realistic and i applaud it for that but you arent going to get any fans for blocking the obvious romance
anime,removed,i always like to point out that in full metal alchemist that the childhood friend winry gets together with the mc but then i realized there isnt even any competition for the most part
anime,removed,your lie in april spoilers to those who are wondering if its safe to click it wasnt for me
anime,removed,al is the best soul player in that world zero deaths hmmm
anime,removed,totally agree started off as an awesome scifi dealing with futuristic themes only to be turned into an incredibly predictable forced drama romance where the girl dies at the end its pretty much cliché at this point
anime,removed,yea that is what i mean except tsugumi that ship sunk long ago others are all childhood friends
anime,removed,s kek
anime,removed,jibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetishjibrilfetish
anime,removed,in nisekoi i am pretty sure the childhood friend will win
anime,removed,the character with lovey dovey chemistry never wins in macross im not sure that description really fits for anyone minmay and hikaru had this kind of chemistry on occasion but constantly flip flopped between that and standoffish not to mention kaifun lovey dovey sounds closer to hikarumisa in the last segment than anyone plus no one really fits i dont think id ever call guldmyung close to lovey dovey theres not really much romance here because basara is basara no one really won in any case zero still need to get around to it frontier rankaalto felt very one sided to me ranka crushed hard on him but alto from the very beginning felt far more like an older brother taking care of a little sister i never felt much romantic chemistry there him and sheryl had more this was handled much better in the movies though
anime,removed,she comes back in arc thats why we wont get there this season

anime,removed,have you never watched the oscars before its whiter than most anime
anime,removed,some middleolder people are still attracted to your name in japan the lost precious memory is core theme of this movie i know judges are too old to feel though
anime,removed,this movie dosent deserve an oscar nomination you idiots most of you didnt even watch the movie you think its good because you are a bunch of loser all you care is your anime fetish and you dont have the heart to see beyond that oscars is a shitshow still films should be nominated because they are good not because they represent a niche despite it sucks ffxv is a movie that should get some oscars attention
anime,removed,lol youre delusional most people here dont even know what echoes aremean and even less are upvoting this because of antisemitism most people including me are upvoting this because of it taking a jab at the drama around diversity in the oscars also considering the fact that you seem to want to hang people it looks like you have a major case of paranoia you need help dude
anime,removed,pol needs our help today
anime,removed,they actually do though i think tomoya remembers everything that happened in the bad timeline thats why in the end he decides to even make up with his father on the last episode why would he otherwise right well atleast thats how its like in the vn pretty sure thats implied in the anime too but cant remember

anime,removed,this is how dio discovered the worlds time stopping powers
anime,removed,she had motives and desires that extended beyond the mc but later only exists to please the mc after some point nothing she does doesnt involve subaru in some way
anime,removed,iirc it was meant to be a just deserts kind of scenario since that was the demon that killed corkus and i believe she seduced him

anime,removed,except for the part where iskandar wanted to conquer the world and trump is so scared of it he wants to build a wall to keep it all out yeah sure they are similar if you ignore the parts where they are polar opposites
anime,removed,both are flamboyant tyrantsand the similarity ends there to put it in cliche terms trump is motivated by fear iskandar by love for being true to oneself greed and all and for inspiring his people iskandar would never commit genocide or shut out certain groups he would conquer and turn them into his own subjects and he doesnt see that as a bad thing rather than forcing his own set of beliefs onto his people he takes on and embodies their will

anime,removed,so any plans on unbanning digibro yet seems like about its about damn time ironkraken did not make a good case as to why he should stay banned
anime,removed,im fine with it as long as they conveniently kill that little fucking shit familiar faggot motherfucker it makes me real salty
anime,removed,about the dying part i can only party agree because of the number of people that actually died in this series normally most of the characters would make it to the happy ending yet here lots of characters were killed right and left even those that mettered as for the mc this series made me look at mcs characters consistency from whole new perspective first of all the refusal of joining the undertakers left me baffled because that was the expected thing even though he joined them eventually they turned it around in a better way imo as for his behaviour it too is expected of mc to change with some major events in some series even minor events mold mc like a plasticine however he stood his very ground through almost entire series even though he was toyed with screwed with and manipulated left and right im not disagreeing with you i just find it an interesting change from majority of anime series dont you think
anime,removed,give me high five buddy finally someone has a similar thought as mine btw can i paste this to animesuki forum discussion
anime,removed,naota from flcls ability where his head is a portal to the deepest reaches of space through which giant mechs are invading earth oh and he also fuses with a mech by being eaten by it and fights with energy guitars which were also pulled out of his head

anime,removed,who im checking the mal page but theres nobody with that name in the showdid you mean ram too soon
anime,removed,i told him to watch it in its original language not dubbed like a degenerate fucking retard would
anime,removed,lol now i realise ive been having two separate convo with you bud what i mean by silent protagonist is when a character shows little emotion and talks few words they can talk to everyone but only if necessary a well written example is yuuji from grisaia and a walking plot device is inaho from aldonoah zero i agree about arc but later on his planning was so detailed and rational that you didnt think hes phased by the events at all which is why i said in my first post that it was at the expense of emotions his choices of action are all plot driven rarely did he expressed irrationality none of his choices are meaningful as a human only as a character of mol i do agree that subtle emotion expression is the best way for story telling it was really well utilised in after training with his school mates and he said after all of this i gotta repay themknow them better or the after the spider tunnel attack you can feel his anger confusion and fear its just that in the arcs where he needs to save those people who died at the beginning of the loops or when he infiltrated the landlord he didnt express much emotion nor subtle hints of it just sarcasm and information exchange really and i guess the man this is annoying thing
anime,removed,suicidesquad
anime,removed,i like my characters broken or at least a little eccentric and orange definitely doesnt give me that i mean the entire plot revolves around the male lead being suicidal does that not qualify as broken
anime,removed,the loli that got raped is around in the level of suffering and deserved the ptsd attack she had was fucking heartbreaking man
anime,removed,at this point its obsession though it seemingly hints that subaru holds the witch gene for authority of pride so a lot of it is pride
anime,removed,i dont think she deserved thats what she gets for s turning into a car
anime,removed,sue for damages yuuki yuuna is not a better madoka i have brought my judgement on this show before approximately eight months ago but now i have finally decided to bring it before the court and hope that justice will be served the show was described to me as a better madoka one that fleshes out the two dimension gen characters added a squeeze of slice of life and dashed in its own personality what i found was a poor ripoff that failed at understanding what made madoka more than just an edgy magical girl show namely all of the characters in yy were entirely one dimensional and tropebased karin being the absolute worst offender for many if the plot is decent enough the action intense enough or sometimes if the music is good enough we can deal with soso characters but for a sol the whole focus being on character interaction it was a chore to watch trope a interact with trope b mostly because it beats you on the head with what the characters were feeling after just showing it and because none of the actual events were compelling or original in the first place add to this the cliched use of pathetic fallacies unnecessary flashbacks lackluster cgi even more unneeded fanservice of togo s fake ending that was not surprising at all and the controversial ending it all just began piling up so that the minor things suddenly became exponentially more painful to bear something like yuuki not knowing why s was in a wheelchair despite being childhood friendsand neighbors or how the inubouzaki sisters have their arc perfectly designed to s the most suffering i guess the point in which i knew the show had no reasonable competence was when s she tried to kill herself multiple times why not a single character reacted in any sensible or reasonably way to it no one said anything along the lines of wow thats insane you dont sound mentally healthy but just went with it but worse still was the fact that they actually show you the exact same scene she just described at the start of the next episode which may be excusable but they pretend to add dramatic tension as if you dont know whats going to happen its literally the opposite of show dont tell for many i think the ending was one of the biggest faults with the show but for me it was only the cherry on top i can commend yy for attempting something interesting but in every single respect of the show viz animation sound design music characters plot etc i cannot consider it even on par with madoka let alone better than it
anime,removed,theres something else you are forgetting
anime,removed,actually i think this is the last one then we go to spoiler things just read the wiki if you are that curious
anime,removed,why i constantly yell rem during each new episode thats good question there is no rem in rezero only ram and rom
anime,removed,yes and she just killed herself in the most recent episode yay witch is dead happy ending
anime,removed,if your honor permits id like to request that the plaintiff to produces evidence on behalf of the s false advertisement
anime,removed,is an fancharacter mirror ram with blue hair
anime,removed,that library is able to overcome the witchs magic it must have some serious mojo to be able to do that since while in the library beako is able to remember subaru past lives
anime,removed,geiger counter s its a loli rape doujin
anime,removed,who is this never seen such a character in rezero looks a bit like ram though
anime,removed,subarus recent suffering will pay off in a major way for him
anime,removed,a lot of people seem to be thinking that has a lot of action or a lot of despair like that is not the case at all there will be a whole lot of talking happening the only reason this is hyped up is because you get to say the word youve been wanting to say since forever finally s there will be a whole lot of talking happening the only reason this is hyped up is because you get to say the word youve been wanting to say since forever finally
anime,removed,the infamous episode ive been hearing the past few weeks i have a feeling this episode will be like the sp from got
anime,removed,site has nsfw ads so you might just want to tag this op also does anyone know who is this girl on the left looks like a recolored mirrored version of ram wtf
anime,removed,i swear if people on this sub start pretend rem never existed like the kh sub with xion i am going to loose it
anime,removed,who is the blue haired girl on the poster

anime,removed,whos the blue haired girl
anime,removed,i mean kousei kind of got a happy ending he overcame his fear and became much more confident
anime,removed,euphoria
anime,removed,oh cool how do you get the animes then ive heard about torrenting but i dont know how that works i think you can download them on kissa dont want problems with the mods xd but thats tiresome isnt it
anime,removed,spoilers ahead honestly with what happened to rem i was actually angry i mean i said son of a bitch its like her existence just fucking vanished what the hell even ram forgot her fuck im not sure what else theyre gonna do to fuck things up
anime,removed,with the direction the manga is going id be more surprised if something didnt happen i mean not to get your hopes up or anything
anime,removed,totally wanna see hifumi in cosplay d ps you will soon
anime,removed,doesnt rem just become waifu bait s she basically just says she loves subaru and she just seems like she has no character left other than being pretty do you think theres more to it than that
anime,removed,from what ive heard about episode its going to further cement rem as waifubait and im just so disappointed at that
anime,removed,go to the land of pirates specifically a horrible subbing site or a european meow and get subbed episodes there and then turn off the subs manually in your video player
anime,removed,next episode mob gets dragged into an idiotic event run by idiots for idiots the one that then appears before him is a violent yet handsome guy
anime,removed,was that supposed to be a madoka reference when the girl falls off the crate and breaks her neck idk she kindve reminded me of mami at that point i may be reaching here
anime,removed,hopefully he wont go gon mode yet
anime,removed,cory in the house
anime,removed,who
anime,removed,k i s s a n i m e
anime,removed,in my heart lelouch is still alive and lives happily married to cc tt also totally agree with nanami especially if you look at the lns ending
anime,removed,yea i mentioned how dislikable reigen was to me but when hes not actively swindling mob and actually giving out advice hes actually okish and from what ive gleamed he gets better so ill be looking forward to that
anime,removed,ive never heard of this character before who is she
anime,removed,i always get salty when that one dude sleeps with the main girl that chops off her mans head cause of love
anime,removed,itt so many fucking embarrassing virgins
anime,removed,i was able to find it on the first anime torrent site and the first streaming site i checked cant mention the names here though
anime,removed,s it bit all of his limbs off when he tried to facefuck it but he was healed right after that so definitely worth it
anime,removed,yea s shigatsu wa kimi no uso
anime,removed,because op is a faggot
anime,removed,i just finished rezero subarus mid season breakdown gave me the same frustrations shinji ikari gave me throughout the respective series thats alone makes it a masterpiece oh and loved rem shes such a sweetheart btw is there a re zero subreddit cant seem to find it
anime,removed,spoiling the plot of fuuka because i dont care s they spend chapters building up a decent romantic relationship with mc and fuuka then a truck kills her thats right truckkun is here this is pretty interesting and the plot is decent going forward as a new girl with the same name appears and mc starts to fall for her instead then chapters later old fuuka comes back complete with all the stuff only old fuuka could have but its not actually her its someone completely different and thats literally all the story they have so far after chapters thats it its like the definition of fan abuse
anime,removed,nagi no asukara complicated love story with a lot od development between the characters it is only a pity the romance does not develop beyond the confession stage
anime,removed,it depends in toradora they make it obvious which girl wins in the first minutes and the op
anime,removed,yeah well if anyones standard for a best girl is well she suffersand hates everybody then yup those are not my standards annoyedkirito

anime,removed,she was a character that made all the other characters more awesome just by existing her scenes with rin were great and showcased rins more human side she added a lot of shading and depth to rider as their relationship had some great chemistry and rider really fits her thematically lastly her development and past helped make matou shinji into less of a onedimensional bully
anime,removed,you forgot fateprisma illya kaleid liner the movie adapts the story of shirou and the fifth holy grail war in the ainsworth world

anime,removed,woah is delsana a popular guy he came as the first suggested link by google he definitely must have an amazing taste s ftfy
anime,removed,this is still nothing compared to whats to come that is if white fox dares to be as faithful as possible
anime,removed,s it is the dog bite i said literally what you said in the last episode thread and the manga readers confirmed it for me
anime,removed,theres no real explanation about it though as far as i can tell even in the manga none of the light novels are translated so no source on that in my opinion its a sentient force or or if this ability was given to him whoever gave it to him also has a hold on him and can prevent things as needed the hand was just a way of the ability saying if you tell you will have heart attack and die right now
anime,removed,i dont know who this guy is but he watched boku no pico so he gets my respect
anime,removed,credits all to umitrospeed and with this dear anime only you caught a glimpse of what rezero is truly about suffering insanity breakdowns death and emotions going wild yes all the metagenresavy commentary that subaru did with his impulsive and obnoxious personality was all to build up to this point the author said „hmm why dont let him have a little bit of fun and let him live out his personality before i truly crush him yes the prior episodes were build up to this and what awaits us now first of all props to white fox for going all out with this show the art and animation quality even increases over the course of the season subarus voice actor did a stellar job i could feel his pain and emotions and whoever draws those gorgeous backgrounds and the characters face expressions deserves a medal and skipping the op and ed sasuga white fox they clearly now that this episode is a key moment early in the story so we see subaru breaking after he put on a happy facade for so long yes he didnt just shrug it off like some people thought he actually was forced to swallow it and move forward and all this now came back at him causing him severe mental pain now some important things to note is that the reason for rem killing subaru wasnt an order and it wasnt jealousy it has to do with subaru being suspected to work together with the witches cult or some faction that is opposed to emilia apparently rem comes to that conclusion because he reeks of the witch an unbearable smell that only a few can perceive beatrice and rem so far this means subaru had and has contact with the witch of jealousy even if he doesnt notice it its also pretty ironical that the blue ogre who was so selfless in the story now acted out of selfishness hatred also its interesting that beatrice only noticed it in this loop so it seems like it gets stronger and stronger with each loop which could cause problems for subaru later what if nearly every person he meets from now on tries to kill him because the immediately recognize that smell then this scene with the hand there you have one drawback to his power he cant tell anyone he completely alone with his fate with these memories and these traumatizing experiences i dont know if anyone has noticed but this hand is in the op and ed both times symbolizing the one force that grabs him away from his loved ones and his happy ending subarus mental issues get apparent through many things he is sleep deprived probably because of the fear of getting killed the manga added some details on that as he cut himself to stay awake if he sleep he has nightmares that haunt him he cant cheer up and most of allhe chases the one person away who is this bright light that gave him the power to struggle through everything so far at this point he is truly broken then beatrice shows that shes actually a genuine being by helping him out of her own free will apparanetly she cant watch someone die in front of her she also seems to be physically and vitally bound to the library then the scene with rems death this basically confirms that someone or something else is doing also some killing this also raises the theory that the curse and the killing through rem are two separated things done by two different beings its also ironical because the blue ogre who was so selfless is now dead oh and when subaru saw emilias dissapointed a bit of my heart broke jesus and at last we see the powerful scene at the end subaru plays with the thought of killing himself i think we cant even imagine how this must feel like your instinct and logical thinking as a human being tells you to not do it but subaru pretty much has to in order to make everything undone i cant even imagine such a conflicted thought process in the end we see him catching on to a new motivation he realizes that those two maids are not truly bad they simply acted according to something he doesnt know so he decides to learn about what he doesnt know and get his and their „happy ending he has such a determination that it ends up being the driving up in his suicide this was the point in the story where i found a whole new level of respect for this poor guy and started to really like him well that was something also for episode there might be some delay or pause according to the official website this may not affect us but theres still the possibility
anime,removed,rapehorse best horse
anime,removed,well i cant answer that anymore because for me the episode already showed that he cant say anything but if you want a more solid answer no he really really cant say anything about it now or ever

anime,not_removed,i was gonna say kirby right back at ya but it doesnt have a school setting or haremromance still though you should watch it its light hearted and the animation is pretty decent
anime,not_removed,clannad and clannad afterstory
anime,not_removed,well my first instinct is to recommend fullmetal alchemistbrotherhood because of the insistence on english dubbing on account of it having one of the best dubs out there but its somewhat light on your other points it does have a fair bit of comedic scenes but it also gets pretty damn heavy too toradora would probably be very good for you i know youve probably heard it at least once before and this is just a suggestion but you should consider getting at least somewhat comfortable with subs the vast majority of voice acting is much better in subs even if you reject that as a good argument it is a simple factual statement that at least being willing to watch subs will open up numerous anime that you wont ever see otherwise and could very well enjoy
anime,not_removed,acchi kocchi yuri yuri luckystar nichijou
anime,not_removed,for the weirdest reason i cant seem to find fullmetal alchemist on you list
anime,not_removed,alright just make sure you dont always stick to dubs for example eraseds dub is pretty good but the japanese voices are amazing clannads dub is horse shit and some shows imo lose a bit of their charm when dubbed like steinsgate
anime,not_removed,well worth it to finish plus when you finish the anime you can watch the movie which is absolutely phenomenal
anime,not_removed,good to know
anime,not_removed,sorry every time i see tetsuo i think of nendou from saiki kusuo no psinan is it weird
anime,not_removed,hes a great character cant wait to see how far he goes in future best guy contests probably not far

anime,not_removed,i know hiyori iki from often copies a move of her favorite wrestler who is also her husbando and her friends make fun of her for it not sure if thats what you were looking for but thats what came to mind first edit misread the post mixed up male and female disregard said comment
anime,not_removed,all i can remember is the movie ip man but thats not anime
anime,not_removed,ip man anime best anime i shall perform my devastating technique lap sau
anime,not_removed,jungle savate ftw
anime,not_removed,its ip man idk why i was thinking it was an anime
anime,not_removed,no worries i havent even seen noragami anyway
anime,not_removed,i just realized before reading this that it is ip man i was thinking of
anime,not_removed,lolol
anime,not_removed,trueyeah its not fate then gah its right there i can almost see the scene but cant remember any of its defining features
anime,not_removed,not an anime its ip man
anime,not_removed,well in that case you should watch noragami
anime,not_removed,wow i was actually about to suggest watching ip man because it had a similar idea guess it worked out
anime,not_removed,i indeed might
anime,not_removed,haha indeed it did i was researching wing chun and then once i saw ip man i made tge connection and voila it did thanks for your reply
anime,not_removed,httpwwwanimefillerlistcomshowsrurounikenshin the correct order would be tokyo arc episodes its an introductory arc to the characters with a miniarc raijuta arc episodes i didnt like that miniarc even in the manga but its canon kyoto arc episodes one of the best arcs jinchuu arc chapters the final arc and probably my favorite theres also these ovas rurouni kenshin tsuiokuhen trust and betrayal ova it adapts the part called remembrance in the manga chapters chapters during the jinchuu arc its like a flashback arc id suggest to read the manga and then watch the ova later but watching the ova could be enough i think the manga version is better but this ova is praised by a lot of people rurouni kenshin seisouhen reflection i wouldnt recommend watching this one it isnt canon the creator wasnt involved and the ending is awful the manga version for the ending is much better
anime,not_removed,thanks for this
anime,not_removed,this time feel like thats higher than we usually get ladies fistbump
anime,not_removed,the top most popular anime yuri on ice nods in approval
anime,not_removed,hmmm the average age around here keeps on creeping up the mode is finally firmly in the college range and the mean is almost able to buy a beer in the states but the age frequency chart makes me wonder i highly doubt there are suddenly a couple of year olds as well as four
anime,not_removed,the redditors of ranime are on average years old although the majority is years old so had to rethink this in my last results post when you think about it majority isnt really the best word to use here mode might not be a popular word but majority isnt really well suited to replace it
anime,not_removed,i kinda expected keijo to be at the top for males was surprised
anime,not_removed,seems like the female percentage increased a bit since the last survey which i like
anime,not_removed,top fm viewership watashi ga motete dousunda guys guys speaking as someone who hates yaoi shows this manga is fucking hilarious and its a parody of the genre please please please give it a try and watch it because its totally worth it
anime,not_removed,the top highest expectations saiki kusuo no psi nan cour it was so underrated and im glad this show finally gets some love woo
anime,not_removed,wow has the nisio isin hype train not left the station or something expected zaregoto to be way higher on its list
anime,not_removed,how interesting theres a small age peak of people on this sub who are years old i wonder why taigasigh
anime,not_removed,more and more this seems to be the season of sequels with a few standout shows on the side got high hopes of occulticnine
anime,not_removed,most people will be watching anime of this season ranime pls you gotta step it up
anime,not_removed,thought people were being overly harsh on bloodivores because the name is awful so i went to watch the pv good god that looks awful the sound is bad the dialog is bad the animation is bad the pv started so promising too
anime,not_removed,a selection of questions you want to ask comments why no watch better shows boobs ass or legs vote sumiya haruhi finish this thought give me moe or give me bannable rezero spoiler joke does soulja boy look like goku how will you deal with the eventual end of jojo kaiki best girl would you watch lawyers on broomsticks what kind of sports from the olympic games in tokyo world you want to get an anime how do oyu clean gajin blood from your katana
anime,not_removed,that male female ratio for keijo though
anime,not_removed,god that ranime age range makes me feel old in my mid twenties
anime,not_removed,so on average ranime isnt old enough to buy a beer makes sense really
anime,not_removed,i am okay with this its what i expected most importantly i need to personally highfivehugfistbump all the others that are hotly anticipating okusama as much as me
anime,not_removed,this may not be the place but this is the first i have heard of an oregairu ova despite being a big fan of the series is it new story material or just fan servicelargely recapbest moments kind of thing
anime,not_removed,keijo is for males fujoshibait is for females how expected
anime,not_removed,wow didnt even know any of the top answers on the popularity list guess im watching more than i thought i would this season
anime,not_removed,so will it be possible to stream hibike on crunchyroll ive looked at their lineup for the fall season and i dont see it mentioned on their site am i missing something
anime,not_removed,those haikyuu expectations hype
anime,not_removed,most people will be watching anime of this season what and here i stand at i think the how do you decide what to watch question should have had an additional answer i watch the first episodes of almost everything first and then i keep watching it anyway also im glad most people would react just like me to having anno peeling an orange in their house
anime,not_removed,im down for animated keijo battles
anime,not_removed,i am always surprised by the percentage of males on here even though i am a guy too most of my friends that are into anime are girls
anime,not_removed,if of the people here are reading manga or at least the people who voted are despite that being an absolute minority of a minority niche in the west regarding the united states media consumption then this sub is extremely misrepresenting the actual population of western media viewers and this sub is made up of western media viewers so thats really confusing this sub needs to have some comparison to the western majority of anime viewers too so we can see how the tastes diverge in a visual way other than knowing they prefer actionstory and fighting style anime plus mecha and they prefer dub and not manga and watch toonami etc
anime,not_removed,the majority doenst even watch more than anime a season what a bunch of casuals
anime,not_removed,blockbuster of the year
anime,not_removed,sports
anime,not_removed,let us end the sausage fest together
anime,not_removed,rengehype
anime,not_removed,yay this makes me so happy ᴗノ remember girls to come check out rxxanime
anime,not_removed,i keep on forgetting to participate in these p but i remembered this time gotta get that percentage up
anime,not_removed,i usually forget to participate in these surveys my eyes usually overlook the top two threads
anime,not_removed,i almost picked male lol
anime,not_removed,nice maybe in a few years this sub will have good taste urbansmile
anime,not_removed,that feeling when you find out your years older then the majority of users
anime,not_removed,the average age around here keeps on creeping up id like to think of it as us growing up with the subreddit
anime,not_removed,as well as four what a weird coincidence right
anime,not_removed,yeah quite a firm bump for college aged users lots of users still in their late massive jump for senior high school students
anime,not_removed,technically the correct word is plurality
anime,not_removed,why isnt mode popular i think everyone here will have covered what that means its like primary school maths
anime,not_removed,yeah that is weird regalia has no fanservice and is not even real yuri which are usually the type of shows that are watched a lot more by males
anime,not_removed,we are the
anime,not_removed,well im convinced mostly because im easily influenced while bored nicoheart
anime,not_removed,im going to watch it but i dont really like parodies of things i dont watch anyway so i dont expect much its only a short anyway though isnt it
anime,not_removed,i looooove the manga its laugh out loud funny
anime,not_removed,thats not actually popularity it just means the people who plan to watch it people who are already watching it expect it to be very good
anime,not_removed,people who watch episodes of something are probably going to expect the next to be good its a bias rather than a congratulatory thing personally i dropped the series nothing against it but the comedy wasnt great and i dont think the concept worked that well with subs
anime,not_removed,i saw the initial website announcement but i didnt even realise it was airing this season it also seems to be just an ova
anime,not_removed,it has been pretty under the radar this season i bet theres a lot of people looking forward to it that didnt even realize it starts next season
anime,not_removed,evilgrin
anime,not_removed,that is genuinely funny
anime,not_removed,im trying ive got to many shows to catch up on
anime,not_removed,i meanhave you read the synopsis first time i thought a show was a clusterfuck before it even aired
anime,not_removed,i need to keep an eye on this
anime,not_removed,why no watch better shows no time gotta study boobs ass or legs legs vote sumiya haruhi no finish this thought give me moe or give me theres an option moe it is bannable rezero spoiler joke hahaha does soulja boy look like goku no how will you deal with the eventual end of jojo lol jojo ends when pigs can fly im only caught up midway through part of the manga still got a long way to go kaiki best girl k would you watch lawyers on broomsticks probably what kind of sports from the olympic games in tokyo world you want to get an anime someone gimme a pentathlon anime how do oyu clean gajin blood from your katana a flick to clear most of it then a small cleaning rag
anime,not_removed,yeah i know that sports anime usually atract more male audience but that ratio is just ridiculous
anime,not_removed,only for those in freedom land the rest of us have been legally drinking for a few years now
anime,not_removed,for drinking is one of the dumber laws in us
anime,not_removed,i cant imagine thats actually a widely respected law underage drinking is common in the uk and our drinking age is i talked to some japanese students i mentored about this and even they said they just found bars that dont id
anime,not_removed,its adapting a side volume and features an actual date tho i wont spoil the contents its not filler the volume is a heavy fan favourite because it features a certain character who just appeared on the front page of ranime
anime,not_removed,fujoshibait its a shoujo romancereverse harem parody comedy
anime,not_removed,the new links usually arent up until only a couple of days before the first airtimes
anime,not_removed,i usually start or so this season its its just weirdly come together that this season is dominated by sports anime anime i havent seen the prerequisettes for or anime i already dropped that being said ill probs end up watching or so first episodes of random series anyway just to top up that number and see if i can find anything good
anime,not_removed,its just the people that use reddit which is primarily male dominated
anime,not_removed,if of the people here are reading manga or at least the people who voted are despite that being an absolute minority of a minority niche in the west regarding the united states media consumption then this sub is extremely misrepresenting the actual population of western media viewers and this sub is made up of western media viewers so thats really confusing i dont understand how that is confusing of people who watch anime read manga theyre extremely related
anime,not_removed,what they are existed and enjoyed anime
anime,not_removed,the anime community as a whole is already majority female its just this subreddit thats maledominated
anime,not_removed,but i like sausages
anime,not_removed,that best girl bracket is extremely different from ranime
anime,not_removed,oh i didnt know about this thanks
anime,not_removed,woah there speedy one step at a time
anime,not_removed,remember one day we will be the classics
anime,not_removed,that feeling when you find out youre years older than the person complaining about being years older than the majority of users
anime,not_removed,that feeling when you find out youre around years younger than the majority of users
anime,not_removed,that feeling when you find out that when you started watching anime people of the average age in this survey were not even born yet
anime,not_removed,although the plurality is years old so is the grammar for that right it sounds weird
anime,not_removed,a lot of people would have forgotten the meaning of the word because outside of the world of maths and related fields you dont really encounter or use it
anime,not_removed,mecha not counted as fanservice infidel nonbeliever
anime,not_removed,its not real yuri and its even low on undertones im honestly surprised by the differences as well as the low expectations probably an effect of the mecha genre happy cakeday
anime,not_removed,well its not that big of a gap between regalia and keijo probably even within the margin of error if there are any stats majors want to work the numbers for it
anime,not_removed,finally broke the doubledigit barrier
anime,not_removed,i believe it is a full anime but it was one of the few manga series that i have legit lold at in a long time granted i read much less manga than i watch anime so take that with a grain of salt give the first episode a try if the manga is anything to go by its a good laugh
anime,not_removed,its only an ova in that its not airing on tv each episode will be airing monthly and will probably be a bit longer as each is adapting an entire volume a la katanagatari theres still plenty reason to be hyped imo
anime,not_removed,and the one episode per month thing is probably a bit of a hype killer too
anime,not_removed,prelenny
anime,not_removed,thats the opposite from what ive seen actually most sports anime seem to attract more females i think its quite obvious why keijo is different though
anime,not_removed,well we still have yaoi on ice to counter that d there is a sports anime for everyone
anime,not_removed,if you can volunteer to get shipped off to war at you should be able to buy a beer then too
anime,not_removed,oh cool thank you do we know how we can watch this ova yet
anime,not_removed,that makes sense so since the new season airs in early october we should see the link soon right
anime,not_removed,because thats not true remember this sub isnt a representation of the offline community its very rare that youll find americans that read manga even comic books have gone out the wayside graphic novels still maintain some popularity but only for a few limited series and even the star wars graphic novels dont really have many since the recanonization keeping in mind that excluding china theses only million people that watch late night anime across the world from what i can tell based on the actual metrics released by the companies themselves this website is on reddit a niche website for those that spend time online reading forums and or posting on them its a niche sub on that website based on this posts statistic which is likely not a proper sample size or statistically accurate measure due to it not being done officially it would infer that of the people read manga but since the majority of this sub is american and americans have a niche interest in such things plus reading in general this creates a large issue in regards to accuracy essentially it means that either the poll was inaccurate which is likely or that the small community found on this sub is so niche that the actual western latenight anime viewers arent actually here in number at least in regards to the majority if thats the case it begs the question where the majoritysimilar americans that watch anime are keeping in mind these are the same people that grew up with or fell into toonami adult swim disney xd abc family anime unleashed and the other few channels that occasionally had anime and more recently due to netflixs popularity the younger generation outside of the millennials is growing up with amazon prime cable ondemand and netflix based anime given all that theres a serious need to know just what this community represents because i had assumed it was the western majority but now that im realizing the type of comments posts and behavior of the sub im left to draw very different conclusions
anime,not_removed,whoa that is pretty surprising could you link the source for that
anime,not_removed,dont worry about it pops we need to band together against the masses of uncultured children
anime,not_removed,youre about years old
anime,not_removed,get off the internet before youre jaded
anime,not_removed,wow somebody must have done some work to get us all the way past the divergence mark
anime,not_removed,actually shaft appears to only be adapting the first volume which ill gladly take over no adaptation might be wrong though its just what someone told me
anime,not_removed,ucapitanspiff was making a joke
anime,not_removed,yes the simulcast time has already been announced wednesdays at et or so
anime,not_removed,it would infer that of the people read manga but since the majority of this sub is american and americans have a niche interest in such things plus reading in general this creates a large issue in regards to accuracy no it wouldnt it would infer that of americans who watch anime read manga id say that of people i know who watch anime read manga in fact if i do a quick count of where i definitely know the names that spring to mind for anime watchers only one doesnt read at least some manga so thats like this is excluding the millions whove seen pokemondbznaruto because of course those who have only seen those kinds of series wouldnt be here they dont watch anime they have seen one or two anime
anime,not_removed,women are a huge part of the anime community perception issues exist because people selfselect into their groups both irl and online but theres no major anime gender gap women dont use reddit nearly as much as men there are lots of good reasons for this if you look at the front page and so if you base very much off of this sub youre getting a very fragmented picture of the englishspeaking community to begin with let alone considering the million other factors that someone would play into how people end up on reddit to call reddit a groupthink is wrong but to call it representative of anything other than what the specific people on this board thinkfeel would be incorrect and im not saying you are this is just a piece of context i like to throw out whenever i can
anime,not_removed,gah it took my forever to find it last time this came up and im busy studying so i dont have the time i know its from a survey on the proportion of malesfemales in various fandoms using con attendance as a metric which is the best metric youll get without large amounts resources being poured in and found that something like of anime fans are female you could probably find it if you spent enough time
anime,not_removed,yeah im years old
anime,not_removed,im sorry but thats not going to happen
anime,not_removed,there are different types of anime viewers but since the people on this sub watch the late night anime they are part of that since they are mostly from the west in the united states due to the makeup of this entire website then they are going to be part of the united states population and thus what i said applies knowing people that watch manga has no basis on statistics thats called an anecdote its unreliable the anime viewers in america largely dont read manga and comic books and such have also fallen out of disfavor manga is a very very niche business in the united states not to mention most manga relates to the back wards reading style which is different than americans are used to most dont have color either which is also different it doesnt fit ignoring that you dont get the ability to define who is and isnt considered a viewer of anime the facts remain the information here isnt reliable for the western majority so exactly who is the makeup here i know its very young people based on previous polls and the statistics of reddit but that should still mean the people who watch anime from those shows and that might pursue it otherwise would be represented here obviously i come from that group and several i know do too even if we have different genre preferences but the people here ive never met anyone that thinks acts or has the behavior of the people here im almost inclined to say that unintentionally ive stumbled onto a bastion of weebos but i think thats too harsh and not entirely accurate in this scenario certainly theres a lot of them based on the constant focus on perversion and the spam with shipping a term ive never heard offline even once but still anecdotes aside itd be interesting to have a proper polling here
anime,not_removed,actually the male to female ratio for reddit is about even edit link here courtesy of ujiecut
anime,not_removed,women are a huge part of the anime community i tell people so many times yes some anime panders to male interests but unlike comics it does know how to pander to women and that is why we get a great gender ratio moeecchi doesnt keep anyone away from anime thats wishful thinking to fit an agenda pushing narrative the statistics tell the truth in fact for some decades women were the ones writing the most porn doujinshis in the big comic fests and were only overtaken recently again by doujinshis targeting men women make up of manga readership to this i would say though it is true when you talk about buying which in the end is what matters though not readership looking at many online platforms on the high sea and what is popular on them is pretty telling that there is a huge male readership that isnt accounted for another important thing is merchandise but i cant find statistics on that edit can someone tell me what i said that was disagreeable or not true to provide sources women are as much into lewd stuff as men are which is great and we should accept each other that way
anime,not_removed,yeah audience mf
anime,not_removed,interesting alexa says it overindexes pretty dramatically on men and theyre using algorithms that are pretty sophisticated to determine gender
anime,not_removed,can someone tell me what i said that was disagreeable or not true id also like to know this i have absolutely no idea why youre being downvoted
anime,not_removed,thanks was too lazy to find the source edited it in my original comment
anime,not_removed,now that is interesting id love to see how they determine such things probably browsing habits and interests
anime,not_removed,hmm i dont think theyre using algorithms for gender theyre using voluntary demographic info from people in their global traffic panel sparked my interest though for looking at alexa demo data heres some random sites httpimgurcomarwwma urengiil
anime,not_removed,most of the season soundtrack is reused from the first season it sounds kinda like but im not sure it might be a mix or a new song try listening through the old soundtracks and see if its there
anime,not_removed,dont they just play the ed
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomfmgracqjpg a fun episode all around im really enjoying tamachans little adventure to improve herself shes a surprising mix of concentrated moe and some very relatable and simple artistic traits
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,i binged this series just yesterday and watched just now i feel a distinct lack of fujikawasan screentime throughout the series its just so rare to have a confident character with no insecurities she has character flaws but not the massive insecurities that need saving its just so refreshing to have a confident happy character that just lives life and enjoys it needs more fujikawa
anime,not_removed,seriously one of the greatest anime eds ever
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomjztllyqpng strawberry and cherry blossom habanero edit cocoa tomato
anime,not_removed,the characters in this show are pretty fun httpsiimgurcomzrjqanqpng httpsiimgurcomkytpzotpng
anime,not_removed,seeing honda get serious with her drawing was great also any episode with any shii focus no matter how small is tops in my book
anime,not_removed,thinking juice is blood classic gag
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomgyemkoqpng httpiimgurcomnxacbajpng httpiimgurcomkeklfpopng
anime,not_removed,i feel you shiichan giving out advice can be heavy
anime,not_removed,i love the details of tama drawing like the smudge of graphite on the side of her hand this show is just so unashamedly moe and its so nice
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomvayceshjpg
anime,not_removed,tamachan is so cute i just want to hug her too bad im outside her strike zone though
anime,not_removed,so this is what death by moe is
anime,not_removed,i was surprisingly able to relate to tamachan this episode like her ive been stuck copying manga and anime stills so much so that trying to develop my own style has been a pain
anime,not_removed,spoken like a true rookie programmer when i did programming i got into slumps all the time i did chatbot ai tho would just sit there wondering how to make the code more efficient or what functions to add and waste time doing nothing
anime,not_removed,yeah i noticed the lack of fujikawa as well she needs more screen time
anime,not_removed,it kind of reminds me of beyond the boundarys ed
anime,not_removed,aaah perhaps thats what me meant by warm drink not actually warm temperature but instead sweet spicy warm or im overanalyzing it for fun unrelated sekisenpai looks completely different without her glasses on looks great though
anime,not_removed,i dont think ive seen smudged hands from pencil drawing in any form of media ever so surprised to see it here
anime,not_removed,no tamachan would hug you she is the dominant one after all
anime,not_removed,can i just point out that the cia database apparently carries information on her three sizes wallbang
anime,not_removed,hey bob we need a name for the new character no prob hand me a keyboard proceeds to smash fist into keyboard several times now we just add some appropriate vowels here and there and we should be good

anime,not_removed,can you explain this what are the numbers referring to
anime,not_removed,hey man dont be so quick to judge maybe its just the size of her average carbohydrate intake per meal

anime,not_removed,if any show this season needed to reboot and start over its orange while regalia wasnt exactly a ufotablequality visual spectacle i didnt really notice any glaring issues like in orange or sousei no onmyouji
anime,not_removed,i think ill give it a shot
anime,not_removed,im actually very excited because i have never witnessed by myself something as episodes thrown away for the sake of getting better production overall cant wait for it o
anime,not_removed,sadly they had already stated that they werent touching the problems i had with the series they werent going to back and rewrite the episodes to improve the flailing plot fill out the flat characters or push the dialogue from execrable to anything close to competence
anime,not_removed,man this orange issue has been a thing wherever i go i think i might pick it back up just to witness it myself
anime,not_removed,yeah the characters were the worst and it was just too many lolis for me and felt weird in a mecha series didnt expect them to fix that anyways

anime,not_removed,unotretower makes a post about hunter x hunter hoping it would be roasted
anime,not_removed,the greed island arc is boring as fuck the chimera ant arc is long the narrator made me want to drop also it keeps adding stronger antagonists without really showing why they are so dangerous the only explanation is hisher aura is so strong but its not like i can sense it so its just lame and repetitive for example i still dont know how strong pitou a major antagonist is because they didnt show her fight with kaito and she got reckt by gon
anime,not_removed,greed island was boring as shit especially when compared to the previous arc
anime,not_removed,what is it a show about going out in the forest and hunting animals i hope im doing this roasting thing right

anime,not_removed,who
anime,not_removed,homura probably shops at hot topic
anime,not_removed,ive always disliked hachiman he may be smart but he is a fanservice protagonist he is asocial but can get the best girls also he says a lot of obvious or dumb bullshit just because he was rejected a few years ago and he hasnt grown up he is a teenager that sounds like a hippy
anime,not_removed,his little sister used his name to insult him dunno if we can roast him any harder than that
anime,not_removed,hachiman is a selfinsert character who just talks about peoples personas starts snoring s does such a shitty job at saving the world her girlfriend has to leave their existanse to clean up what homura couldnt do
anime,not_removed,if he was perfect he wouldnt want something genuine cause hed be able to make it so

anime,not_removed,i know this is a roast but that dub was pretty good
anime,not_removed,chris is my waifu does anyone have the courage to roast her
anime,not_removed,you dont know that
anime,not_removed,the point was to roast it not point out its strengths
anime,not_removed,miiatears
anime,not_removed,what
anime,not_removed,amarti makes a hell of a more interesting character than lawrence ill say that much
anime,not_removed,great now well both have to share waifus
anime,not_removed,do you even season
anime,not_removed,amarti
anime,not_removed,so are we still roasting or are you seriously saying that
anime,not_removed,yes i do have you ever thought that her tsundere tendencies are getting in the way
anime,not_removed,its a character in sw nobody likes him
anime,not_removed,hes a character from spice and wolf
anime,not_removed,real talk now lawrence is really boring and its what makes season significantly worse for me while his interactions with holo are great theyre so because of holo holo carries the show hard amarti is annoying but hes a lot more interesting and if you think about it hes your standard shoujo guy
anime,not_removed,no wonder youre putting him here then
anime,not_removed,is he like the lead
anime,not_removed,i dont understand why people downplay the importance of lawrence that muchholo is a great character and she outshines him but he is just as important to those interactions as holo just try to replace him with anyone and it wont stay the same
anime,not_removed,i believe he leads germany in the early
anime,not_removed,no hes kindaaaa an antagonist that a lot of fans really hate
anime,not_removed,i said as much i just think that alone hes painfully boring while amarti can stand on his own as a character i dont know how holo and amarti would do with their own show and that doesnt matter since holo and lawrence work but in a standalone amarti holds a much higher bar than lawrence
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,and he also did nothing wrong
anime,not_removed,i just think that alone hes painfully boring nbsp i wont say lawrence is boring he is painfully slow and takes time catching on things but thats why he makes the perfect partner for holo nbsp amarti holds a much higher bar than lawrence nbsp i flat out disagree he is just a overconfident selfcentered brat who thinks that he is always right
anime,not_removed,and yet lelouch is currently destroying the best character brackets
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,i am currently in the middle of watching the series i am glad they added this as well
anime,not_removed,have this on vhs when i was a kid this was on constant repeat and a reason that my parents bought a rewinder that would rewind the tapes faster than the vcr the good ole days
anime,not_removed,why
anime,not_removed,hours ago and no comments seems like no one even cares about this show lol even hundred managed better and thats basically the same type of show as this in some ways i feel that this season improves in some aspects but in a lot of others its a bit of downgrade i think flora was the worst of the new additions she tried way too hard to be cute in my opinion and served as little more than a damsel in distress and one that isnt exactly worth saving imo also didnt help that the ending was vague as all hell will there be a season likely not so the open ending is a cocktease as showcased on twitter seems like youre tackling bakuon next and ill definitely be there for that i find that show very relatable but to avoid spoilers here ill save that paragraph or two for the eventual review though theres two components to the series that i know will drag it down for you a lot the fanservice and animationsound
anime,not_removed,oh god the second season wasnt good to begin with but is just worse in almost every aspect would have been interesting if digibro decided to make videos about this season p main reason why the season was worse the tournament it was just boring not fun to watch and of the season was about it this is not how you make a good tournament arc flora chitose morinaga as flora while certainly reaching a high pitch uses a voice that is quite grating often distracting to listen to oh god why do you have to remind me of her i always got a headache while she was talking but it was kinda fun to follow the episode discussion threads when they were always compaining about her
anime,not_removed,hello once again banjo sorry im late i tried to comment the other day when i saw this thread but it didnt end up happening i think youre right on the money by saying that it has too many weaknesses for any of its strengths to support from asterisk had blatantly bitten off more than it could chew the story is much too large scale for it to actually be likely for a finish there are way too many characters and the world is much too big just when you think there is too much going on already they throw some other random shit like flora being kidnapped to make things even worse due to this each episode felt like it was written and directed by different people with no outside knowledge or help other than a brief summary of the prior episode i think you generally covered most of my other problems with this show constant reliance on a handicap outcomes are not exactly powerful needs extra characterization did not make for interesting fights the handicaps were blatant closure if you can call it that was pretty much nothing other than a transition to the next arc characters sucked and got no development specifically all of them and lastly almost every fight other than the twins sucked this is very bad coming from a tournament junkie like myself as for some positives i loved sylvia her appearance was stupid her power was stupid and the lack of her was stupid other than that she was badass really cute in personality and looks and also held as the most interesting encounter for me the sound department was by far the best part of the show other than floras annoying as hell voice everything was great the op and ed carried the show for me is a very nice score for because it didnt particularly do anything stupid enough plot wise make me hate it but it also didnt do anything to make me like it thanks for the write up
anime,not_removed,melon hours ago and no comments truth be told it was sad to see disheartening even believe it or not this review now has the honor of being the first one where i had no commentspeople to respond to before heading to bed theres a first for everything i suppose even hundred managed better and thats basically the same type of show as this truth be told again it may have been due to my timing i posted this one at midnight which isnt the best time to have people read almost words of critique she tried way too hard to be cute in my opinion and served as little more than a damsel in distress and one that isnt exactly worth saving imo good point in a show where saya and kirin already exist her spearheading cuteness is basically unnecessary and youre right her connection is nothing more than being someone that looks after julis a strong relationship didnt exist between the two so her kidnapping was not as diredramatic as the show made it out to be will there be a season likely not so the open ending is a cocktease and given the setting there are apparently four other tournaments it would probably take nothing less than four more cours to complete as showcased on twitter seems like youre tackling bakuon next yep d i find that show very relatable hrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i too will save my thoughts for the review though theres two components to the series that i know will drag it down for you a lot the fanservice and animationsound maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe thanks for the comment melon you officially made this thread a success
anime,not_removed,wicked but is just worse in almost every aspect its a shame to see really from what i remember was sort of trying to make this one a popular series for people to latch onto but it didnt reel in many people at all the tournament it was just boring not fun to watch and of the season was about it the opponents who didnt matter to ayatojulis some of the battles lacking anything in terms of interest eg the knight duo was incredibly underwhelming and the side conflict with floraayatos weapon just got in the way there could be some fun scenes like that one twin being punched in the face hardcore or sylvia beatin the crap out of that one lizardlike dude but yea the fights were mostly subpar but it was kinda fun to follow the episode discussion threads when they were always compaining about her ill have to go back and read those threads for i feel their pain p thanks for the comment wicked d

anime,not_removed,holy shit there are more people than me who thought it was good
anime,not_removed,you get it thank you internet stranger
anime,not_removed,so i got a question for you do you consider it all anime or do you rate them separately
anime,not_removed,i like how you write this on caps lol so much hype on ttgl
anime,not_removed,preach

anime,not_removed,this guy
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,haha well aye it was intended to lure out the above all p
anime,not_removed,i guess ill join on this one
anime,not_removed,its extremely difficult this will probably keep me from sleeping tonight wait its already am fuck
anime,not_removed,but you did not tell us your favourites
anime,not_removed,wait seriously
anime,not_removed,i try to keep it a secret but sometimes it just comes out you know
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomfvwxpgif
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcompceqwaegifv
anime,not_removed,each on definitely deserves its own rating the tone and overall feeling of the series changes from arc to arc some people dislike owaris creepy tone and plotlines based on mysteries some people hate nises over the top fan service while others consider it the highlight of the series for example i rate the series as a whole a but id give hanamonogatari and tsukimonogatari a on their own i do however consider it to be just one anime in the exact same way that youd consider any other anime with multiple seasons to be the same anime the seasons needs to be watched in a specific order so you cant exactly count them as their own shows
anime,not_removed,hell man even that question took days of deadlocked arguments between cowboy bebop and legend of the galactic heroes which had to be settled with a coin flip before i could made a decision
anime,not_removed,im not sure which part youre surprised about but yes
anime,not_removed,just out of curiosity which did you prefer dub or sub
anime,not_removed,p
anime,not_removed,my bad i thought you meant you were about to watch ping ping for the time harunaehhh
anime,not_removed,i havent been able to see the official toonami dub for it yet though the clips of it are quite entertaining
anime,not_removed,its also my favourite and i prefer the dub its really good
anime,not_removed,just to give an example darker than black is an amazing anime in y opinion fantastic plot story characters etc easily a and then you reach season and its such a terrible piece of work that giving it a would be generous again in my opinion this isnt a problem unique to dtb either aldnoahzero sword art online log horizon death note gate psycho pass there are a ton of shows out there that have a massive drop in their quality or enjoyability between seasons im not going to give dtb a overall because i loved one season and hated the other because that doesnt do the show the justice it deserves also monogatari did change directors a couple times im pretty sure could be wrong though
anime,not_removed,ah ok because i started rewatching it in dub and i think its pretty solid just wanted anothers opinion
anime,not_removed,which is a perfect example of a reason to rate seasons separately as you can have such differing opinions you can just have a secondary overall rating if you really want
anime,not_removed,an individual chapter would be the equivalent of an episode each separate season is like a different book
anime,not_removed,yes its coming to australia

anime,not_removed,this isnt danganronpa im sure of it how do i know this in danganronpa waifus die theyre not supposed to get revived
anime,not_removed,i laughed so fucking hard when nagito showed up and ultimate bullshitd those rocks to fall down seeing imposter as munakata was pretty hilarious as well
anime,not_removed,shit ended way too happy this can only mean that is going to be brutal should we start a pray circle to save kaede and twintails
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcommzegkfcjpg im so happy that kyoko is alive danganronpa had many flaws but it was a fun ride its nice to see makoto kyoko and the rest of our favorite characters get the happy ending they deserve
anime,not_removed,even tho this episode wasnt really well written i will say this is a great sendoff of the dr and characters this will be the last we will see of them for quite some time probably and its nice to finally have a happy ending for them despair and future arcs were wild rides and i do not regret watching them one bit
anime,not_removed,so was nagito the only one of the despairs who mutilated his body i thought most of them recycled parts of junkos body but we dont see that with anyone else it seems they still have their memories from the island since kazuichi built many mecha nidais but do they all have their memories from when they were in despair mode at least the survivers from killing game should they seem really happy considering what they did seems like a very short time to come over the fact that you murdered your family mutilated your body and helped destroy the world and most of the people you know are probably dead because of you anyway im glad so many survived though i guess it could reduce the replay value of for some since it takes some of the suspense away knowing everyone will survive except for the single one charachter in the game i can not accept dying why couldnt they somehow magically revive chiaki at least her ai at this point i wouldnt even have cared had she just not disappeared at the end with absolutely no explanation but reviving two best girls in the same episode would probably have been overkill pun intended
anime,not_removed,shameless fanservice pretty much what i expected when they announced a hope episode but id be lying if i said i didnt want my happy ending
anime,not_removed,we got her boys we got ibuki shes singing the song a great time to live when our waifus can live
anime,not_removed,so was this anime flawed hell yes was it the worst thing ever not really for the most part i enjoyed and at the end of the day im just glad that after going through so much shit the characters ive grown to love finally got the happy ending they deserved
anime,not_removed,i honestly feel that this is the ending that i wanted not the ending that i deserve and i feel kind of weird because of that it is almost as though i am a masochist of sorts
anime,not_removed,so who is division head we will never know

anime,not_removed,when i read the title for kibouhen a bit ago i immediately got goosebumps despair and future reached such a level of bleakness that i thought it would give us one final twist that would plunge the series down in a way that fits its thematic struggle however with concluding with a lingering despair concluding with an uncertain hope and udg concluding with neither wouldnt make sense offering us anything other than the final niche and thats a world with a balance between the two with mirai and zetsubou both pressing the issue of faith and trust at different ends making it evident that the brightest lights cause the deepest shadows both series concluding with such extreme notions of hope and despair allowed the bittersweetness of kibouhen to actually produce the most cathartic result possible had to assume their previous positions and the had to revive the institution that ruined the world because without the balance between the two images and what they represent then this would happen all over again beyond the whole wholedespair debacle the central theme of danganronpa was the issue of trust as seen with munakatas love triangle seikoandou kirigiris forbidden action etc both mirai and zetsubou continuously used misdirection red herrings and betrayals to confuse both the characters and the viewers into assuming fake truths and to pan over the biggest clues in favor of looking out for the established danganronpa shock ending ive heard all sorts of crazy but compelling theories positing a turn of events that certainly wouldve been quite the surprise my favorite of which was that so when the time came for tengan to be revealed as the big bad and mitarai the end game it came off as too easy in that sense the untwist came at the expense of us trusting kodaka with him coming out and delivering what he promised a true end to the series rather than what we expected and thats the big mystery we came to expect was always about tying loose ends and wrapping up the world so for it to finish with a conversation between hinata and mitarai may be one of the more boring ways to do so but it accomplishes what it was trying to do in a worthwhile way in that sense i feel like i appreciate what this show ended up doing and love it eitherway even if there were plenty of things i felt a bit uncomfortable with was mirais final plot was too contrived and unnecessarily macabre probably was zetsubous focus was a bit too messy and did some parts feel stretched thin to make room for the miraihen tieins probably but at the end of the day both delivered on what made me fall in love with this series in the first place intelligent character writing strong themes a quirky sense of humor an underlying sense of sheer terror and a uniquely danganronpa way of doing everything while flawed to me excelled in ways i hadnt expected and routinely gripped me in a way only danganronpa can it was a bold experiment in storytelling im sure well look back at for years as one of the more clever uses of the medium weve had and it left me with a warm feeling in my heart what a journey this was from reading those textbased lets plays being published periodically years ago to watching this while talking about it with fans ive met over the years and even a few friends i introduced personally to the franchise this was great and i cant wait for toradorasalute
anime,not_removed,was sorta a meh ending but i guess im satisfied enough that scene with nagito and naegi was hilarious though yeah picture of nagito and hinata standing together ill take anything i can get still salty we only really saw the together once so the pill bottle really was important im sad now i dont wanna say bye to these kids
anime,not_removed,i totally get why some people might find it disappointing and id probably even agree with most of their points but i gotta say i really just loved almost this entire season it might be a case of coming in with somewhat low expectations but it ended up being so much better than i thought itd be and elements that kind of got the short end of things i wasnt even expecting to appear at all so that too was often more of a pleasant surprise than disappointment all in all i thought it was a great send off to the series
anime,not_removed,well this episode felt like fanservice to me not that i have a problem with that since i love the cast kirigiri being alive was already forshadowed and i held onto hope until the very end but did anybody kind of wish for a twist ending somehow tying into danganronpa i was expecting something so this super happy end that we got was bit dissapointing overall i thought zetsubouhen was better than miraihen miraihen didnt even a big twist or anything not that thats mandatory for a great story
anime,not_removed,honestly kirigiri surviving is pretty bullshit but i wont lie im happy that we got a happy ending like that after all the despair we had to go through what a ride when this sequels were announced i was pretty worried that they could end up being pretty terrible but im actually really satified with what we got now time to wait for danganronpa
anime,not_removed,even though i love the cast i think bringing them all back was very cheap and it sort of ruined the emotional impact of the decision the characters had to make in the ending of
anime,not_removed,i love the series and especially this ending im glad kirigiri is alive and well but seeing everyone but the real chiaki still left me in despair i was really hoping hinata would pull some crazy talent and bring chiaki back oh well i guess its ok this way rip best girl torrentialdownpour
anime,not_removed,ok ending it was awesome seeing class return nice to see that they got their happy ending even though chiaki is still gone sob rip all division head theories
anime,not_removed,komaeda and hinata are alive and happy this is all i need but seriously some things didnt make much sense it wasnt explained exactly how hinata managed to get everyone else to wake up do the others have their memories from the island i dunno maybe i fell asleep last episode but who were the people that the cast were fighting some future foundation army eh oh well how did naegi rebuild kibogamine in only a few months eh who cares good scenes hinata being revealed to have heterochromia and still have his memories as izuru as many predicted the logo having naegi and hinata so cool i screamed a lot when komaeda turned up using his good luck for evil good i see that moment where the ultimate imposter is dressed as munakata adorable komaeda getting carried away after starting to creep naegi out togami close your smelly mouth with hagakure proceeding to cover it for the rest of the scene chiaki somehow appearing and explaining how she ended up being the overseer in the new world program i guess it makes sense especially after the despair side episodes kirigiri being resurrected from the dead by the deus ex machina medicine left behind by the pharmacist girl thanks mikan for once but seriously they could have left her dead otherwise she died for no reason other than shock value ehh i guess its not the first time dangan ronpa has dumb writing like that asahina calling komaru potty unless i misheard that heh happy end i guess
anime,not_removed,i cant help but feel this invalidates all the events of future arc was about survival was about redemptionrenewal just feels like it had no overreaching theme to me just despair bad hope good and making senseless murder even more senseless no real bonds formed with the characters and the deaths were even pretty lame and tame so takes something that felt pretty shallow to begin with and makes it even more shallow as the whole point of the actions driving the show are never really achieved just my meandering thoughts it really was good to see the remnants again put a big ol smile on my face even if it ended with a lame talk no jutsu conclusion
anime,not_removed,anime was a mistake
anime,not_removed,man that finale certainly knows how to play with my feelings a good chunk of it was shameless fanservice which i cant deny put the biggest grins on my face but at the same time it was full of bullshit and compared to and resolutions it was nowhere near as satisfying nor cathartic theres not really much to talk about considering how straightforward the finale was but i guess ill mention the things that disappointed me the most how the cast was used for the finale sure they had their massive share of screen time in zetsubouhen i always assumed that they would be playing a much bigger role in miraihen considering how hyped they were from and of course zetsubouhen instead theyre just some deus ex machina only meant to be used for the finale and fanservice i should also toss in monaca considering how much she was hyped at the ending of udg turns out to be meh i accepted it at the time because i assumed that the true mastermind would be even better but lo and behold we get tengans silly plan and mitarai as our final boss thats just really disappointing how the whole resolution panned out the exremnants of despair come in and swoop into mitarai and to stop him they just talk it out just compare it to the awesome and unique ways and did their resolutions finale was one of the most cathartic experiences ive had the pleasure of having so im just really disappointed that ended in the way it did they couldve at least made the talk excitingdynamic or some shit kirigiri surviving really dr this was probably the most unforgivable bullshit they pulled out in this finale that was the lamest copout ever and it just undermined her supposed sacrifice and the resulting motivation it gave naegi like if you were planning on keeping her alive anyway i dont think there was really any need for this kind of asspull in a vacuum i am really happy kirigiri is alive but in the context of how things panned out in miraihen she should have stayed dead or should have never been killed in the first place the best thing from the finale for me was how naegi went on to become the new headmaster of the rebuilt hopes peak academy it was a really good conclusion to naegis journey and was certainly a very happy ending i just wish that the journey there couldve been a lot better in the end im probably gonna give this finale a considering how i still enjoyed the fanservice but i just cannot ignore all the things they could have done better for the entirety of miraihen
anime,not_removed,ujcshaft really is the ultimate hope
anime,not_removed,in hope triumph despair in looks at future rather than dwelling in the past what was im supposed to take in danganronpa
anime,not_removed,screw all the asspulls that happened here im just happy we got a happy ending we deserved it
anime,not_removed,i really liked how they separated it into each segment while the remnants of despair video seems unnecessarily simplistic and the mitarai scene was a bit cheesy i liked the episode as a whole it starts off with badass scenes of chars just being amazing and accentuates their overall characters it was fun to watch gundham tanaka bring out so many dark divas of destruction munakata fighting alongside and nagito pull his immense luck it feels like the mitarai scene shouldve been done by the closest person to him mitarai it feels out of place to have him in the background when hes the guy who knows mitarai the best by far also the countdown was really cheesy the wrapup was sweet and we have closure with every character sometimes the closure brings feelings of sadness but it builds on the hope that each character will move forward it feels like the plot flaws of this episode were flaws that came from previous episodes i doubt this anime will mean a lot to people who have not played but maybe im wrong all in all this was a solid episode that gave a lot to fans of
anime,not_removed,let me cry a little okay chiaki lives in our hearts
anime,not_removed,happy end except maybe for class but they clearly dont mind makoto having the super high school level bullshit all throughout the epiode i was like bullshit and then he does nothing im like okay and then kirigiri revives im like bullshit bullshit bullshit whilst smiling retardedly over her glorious magnificent survival thanks to tsumiki
anime,not_removed,super high school level haircut super high school level smog clearing
anime,not_removed,chiakiiiiiiiiii nooooooo at least one couple survived
anime,not_removed,he writed off as bad end the one in that got kirigiri dead everyone who thought he would kill his waifu was an idiot
anime,not_removed,class sure recovered quickly from the mental anguish of you know killing each other when they thought they were regular classmates no bad feelings right
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,thats bs why does kyouko get to live while best girl waifu chiaki remains dead this is unfair guess a part of me will never be healed but knowing that ai chiaki lives on fills me with hope all in all both anime are a great sendoff to the hopes peak story might be a bit fanservicey but im glad it got a good ending and didnt fall apart
anime,not_removed,one best girl made it out okay so for that i am grateful i enjoyed this season and all the new characters i thought it was balanced well for the fuckton of characters they added even though it had its flaws im generally happy with how it turned out what i definitely missed from the first season is the execution animations upupupu rip in peace all those characters that didnt live till the season finale
anime,not_removed,i love love love dangan ronpa but i was a bit iffy on this episode kirgiris revival was foreshadowed i suppose but after the scene with naegi manning up i really didnt want her to come back as it made it more powerful while i thought theyd have the balls to actually kill one of the cast off nope guess not we got weak fakeouts in a row with aois being the very worst poor munakata gets to lose everything but i guess he isnt important enough to matter tengans plan was horrendously stupid and im left with lots of lingering questions for both the killing game in and i love class so it was nice to see them again but in the nicest way possible this ending felt like a fan fiction and unadulterated pandering literally every single consequence of dangan ronpa has been absolved and it just feels really wrong i loved how bittersweet and ambiguous ended and kodaka himself always admitted he didnt want to reveal their fates but i suppose this was his way of saying here now leave me alone and let me work on after fans whined and complained for years i did very much enjoy the show overall it was just this ending im a bit iffy on still very excited for edit just rewatched the episode again and i liked it a lot more i think the part of my brain that wants to see the entire class okay is overpowering my logical thinking
anime,not_removed,yessssss shes alive
anime,not_removed,i havent been following whats the difference between this and the series that ended a few days ago
anime,not_removed,impostor and mitarais reunion moved me a little too much that hug komaeda meeting naegi had me in stitches a lot of scenes were pretty fun i guess dont know what i expected of a last episode but it was alright
anime,not_removed,so thats it for this season of danganrompa right
anime,not_removed,how did all of the cast live am i remembering wrong or didnt only a few survive the finale of
anime,not_removed,personally i really liked the series and they didnt bring back juzo and chisa and it seems to make munakata want his brighter horizon even more so i think if danganronpa taught us anything as cheesy as it may its that though people leave us we can always remember them as they were and what they meant to us in that way it feels like no one really even left
anime,not_removed,wasnt there hints that she didnt really die though
anime,not_removed,so everyone is mad at kyoko being alive but nobody flinches a finger about the rest of the being alive with no explanation whatsoeversigh i give this whole series a because of how fun was seeing all of the characters being animated even though some of them barely did something to do now for the wait of the game
anime,not_removed,so we are not getting an adaptation of the s killing school trip heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyeeeeeeeell yeeeeeeeeeeah kyoko is alive
anime,not_removed,my soul has been healed im pretty happy seeing them all alive and well and komaeda having a cool robohand lol sure the show had many flaws and left some unanswered questions but i still enjoyed it till the very end i think this is a nice send off for our cast
anime,not_removed,honestly how i see it the anime was a great ride whilst i think that endings really didnt need a sequel to wrap everything up im happy we got a look at what happened after this was entertaining to say the least
anime,not_removed,since were in spoilers thread and discussion id like someone to recap me something because im pretty lost i tought that in game the ones that died in the game got their real bodies fried or killed outside the game worldwhile the rest ofcourse survives bit of a shame that too much text was too much at that ending i just wished for the game to end how did everyone from got back to know shown the rod attacking everyone and somehow naegi brought em togheter for himself maybe to bring em hope again with a new brainwash or something and we saw in that they got brainwashed then put into the game while crew hid themselves at hpa yes i do remember chiaki died and junko made an ai out of her to troll the cast of thats for sure could someone please explain me
anime,not_removed,i feelsohappy i meana danganronpa ending happily thats ridiculous but then again when you think about it weve had to wait games light novels and anime episodes plus more if we count the first game adaptation full of despair to finally get to this point i would call this earned your happy ending
anime,not_removed,wait my biggest question the whole time watching this i had thought the third game came out but apparently is the third game and isnt out yet so is this cannon side cannon an ending to our current characters and then different ones in the game
anime,not_removed,will danganronpa get a next generation of anime featuring naegis children
anime,not_removed,im pretty upset this episode felt like one huge backpedal bringing back everyone they conceivably could all alive and very much well and making so many great emotional bittersweet moments from earlier in the anime and the second game feel totally meaningless i was super upset by the death of kirigiri but thats a good thing it was an emotional moment in the series people cried real tears at that and i came damn close to being one of them i laughed at the cure w theory saw it as typical first stage of grief behavior and goddamn it actually came true and at the absolute last minute they shouldve called the medicine deus em instead for how much of i cant wait for the extended cut of the series where they revive all of class somehow rehabilitate junko to be good despair hating person put the chiaki ai in a robot so she can enjoy life with all her friends again and all go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes because god forbid a series about children murdering each other while the apocalypse is happening around them ends in anyway that isnt afterschoolspecial approved happy ending s just fuck im gonna get flak for this but i feel this was the worst possible way the series could have gone out the first two thirds of the anime were great but the last third of it just felt like fanfiction written by someone who just cant handle anything other than happily ever after edit it absolutely blows my mind that people are perfectly ok with the fact that a character took a magic makes me seem dead but am actually in a near dead state potion and showed up at the end at the last second that is soap opera tier writting but people are fine with it because muh waifu has to live like holy shit people are actually acknowledging that it was a poorly written moment in the series and that they dont care as long as that status bar for kyoko kirigiri on the dr wiki says alive once this is all over and done with i feel like the only sane man right now i saw one of the best moments in the series as a whole die today and everyone is celebrating
anime,not_removed,sigh this ending has definitely dampened my excitement for
anime,not_removed,good thing that almost everyone lived even if lots of things didnt make sense rip nanami now for danganronpa
anime,not_removed,that kirigiri shit was cheap i hate it when anime bring a character back who we thought was dead in the last seconds
anime,not_removed,juzo died
anime,not_removed,seiko is still dead
anime,not_removed,heterochromia loli is still dead
anime,not_removed,great gozu is still dead
anime,not_removed,chisa is still dead
anime,not_removed,junko is still dead
anime,not_removed,bandai is still dead
anime,not_removed,chihiro is still dead
anime,not_removed,ultimate luck
anime,not_removed,saionji is unfortunately still alive
anime,not_removed,the moment i saw the cheesy rocks tumble scene i knew it had to be shsl bullshit behind it oh i love nagito
anime,not_removed,i didnt even know nagitos luck could work like that
anime,not_removed,just think about how tragic irl chiakis death was didnt want to die wanted to be more with everyone wanted to play more with hinata all while seeing that hinata was erased and that all her friends are being turned into despairs i think thats enough of despair for us
anime,not_removed,i know the entomologist is not going to survive because of the bara curse rip sweet prince but i still have my hopes up for lil hitler to be on the final
anime,not_removed,its fine if anyone dies in theyll just make an anime sequel where everyone comes back to life
anime,not_removed,i just want hopebot to survive hopebot a cutie
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,that mustve been interesting to voiceact that scene given that they are both voiced by the same woman bonus points for nagitos name being an anagram for makoto naegi dai am naegi makoto
anime,not_removed,kirigiri for life
anime,not_removed,wait what what are those screenshots from i watched the whole thing and never saw these
anime,not_removed,i stopped the despair arc right after s chiaki met despairafied chisa i dont have the heart to watch all the bad stuff happen past that point
anime,not_removed,i do wonder how long it will be until we can see them again i dont think they are going to build these characters up and then simply abandon them
anime,not_removed,kuzuryu gouged out his own eyeball to put in junkos eyeball we can see several scenes in despairarc and futurearc where theyre battling with an eyepatchd kuzuryu so we put and together he never lost his eye during despairarc junko died he was seen with an eyepatch fighting future foundation naegi told the group in final case that one them put junkos eyeball into their socket and we finally see kuzuryu still having an injured eye in hopes arc
anime,not_removed,i could be totally wrong and the wiki doesnt seem to mention this but didnt mikan replace her reproductive organs so she could get pregnant and have a babby junko
anime,not_removed,fuyuhiko definitely took her eye probably took it out though
anime,not_removed,hell yeah it is
anime,not_removed,i honestly expected this to be a trainwreck when this was advertized as fanservice for fans and knowing they were also working in the next game but i ended up enjoying it a lot even if it was not as solid as and i much prefer something like this than just another anime adaptation of the game
anime,not_removed,it had a very satisfying sense of closure thats much more than most series can ask for its a surreal experience knowing this storyline has come to an end
anime,not_removed,overall it was really good in a lot of ways the last couple episode were rather weak though
anime,not_removed,i didnt start playing until after id already started zetsubohen it helped me get attached to all the characters now that i know their backstories and now i know they will all be okay i feel better going through the game
anime,not_removed,danganronpa has made us into people who want to feel despair what does this mean does that mean that the despair video was the entirety of danganronpa
anime,not_removed,shl no screentime
anime,not_removed,probably revealed in killer killer
anime,not_removed,best girl pulls through i dont even care if it was an asspull
anime,not_removed,i never gave up hope i knew she would come back best girl lives on
anime,not_removed,he replaced his arm with junkos sometime between danganronpa and danganronpa although i wonder how that arm even survived being crushed burned turned to butter hit by baseballs and hit by a wrecking ball either way when hajime woke him up he probably realized that was a stupid idea removed the arm and probably had kazuichi make himself a new one
anime,not_removed,only sugita could make taht scene as great as it was
anime,not_removed,i guess lerche finally got the permission to use his name
anime,not_removed,lol did anyone recognize the gundam newtype noise during tanakas introduction
anime,not_removed,from reading those textbased lets plays being published periodically years ago to watching this while talking about it with fans im still finding it crazy that the psp fan translated game i kept thinking was too weird to ever get an english release has blown up so big here i still have great memories of struggling with the android ppsspp builds mostly but not quite there support for it at the time
anime,not_removed,goodbye kibougamine im going to miss this high school yuitears
anime,not_removed,and rezero
anime,not_removed,halfway through the episode when they got that video from class playing up the we are the remnants of despair angle i was like oh my god no way then they were all oh theyre totally just pretending for the sake of appearances and then i was like oh nevermind
anime,not_removed,totally feel you on that second one especially since people are saying the previews for are alluding to descendants i seriously hope so and i hope theyll tell us who got together with have who i bet monica orchestrates the killing game though older cast members would be cool too
anime,not_removed,the finale was somewhat uneventful it wasnt bad it wasnt also good i was just expecting more especially from cours worth of anime
anime,not_removed,i mean if you go back to the scene where she dies you can see the cure next to her
anime,not_removed,i actually found their return enjoyable it was closure for hajimeizurus character development
anime,not_removed,people are angry enough for kirgiris revival bringing back chiaki will make people riot
anime,not_removed,maybe i fell asleep last episode but who were the people that the cast were fighting some future foundation army eh oh well i thought they were ff members and they were actually ultimates ff had saved you can see a lot of guys being somewhat special like one fighting with shogi pieces
anime,not_removed,it wasnt explained exactly how hinata managed to get everyone else to wake up do the others have their memories from the island i dunno hes ultimate everything plus he had soda and possibly mikan and nagito to help maybe i fell asleep last episode but who were the people that the cast were fighting some future foundation army eh oh well they httpiimgurcomlsbrcywpng in at the beginning how did naegi rebuild kibogamine in only a few months its not impossible theres still a lot of ultimates left
anime,not_removed,komaeda getting carried away after starting to get carried away with naegi out ftfy
anime,not_removed,it wasnt explained exactly how hinata managed to get everyone else to wake up well given the nature of what hinata is if anybody in the world could have done it it would have been him this was actually the thought i had leaving as well that if they were left to their own devices hinata would spend that seclusion trying to save them how did naegi rebuild kibogamine in only a few months well the future foundation wasnt exactly destroyed or anything still lots of talented people like munakata otherwise she died for no reason other than shock value and you know to further the plot and really allow naegi and munakata to understand one another and come to terms to fix everything that happened instead of having to kill one another apparently its easy to forget that that shared experience they had even temporarily was basically the basis for that
anime,not_removed,there is probably going to be an ova or something where it shows how izuru saves everyone from despair
anime,not_removed,i accepted it at the time because i assumed that the true mastermind would be even better but lo and behold we get tengans silly plan and mitarai as our final boss thats just really disappointing while i felt pretty iffy about tengans plan last episode after digesting it for a bit it kinda makes sense to me what he was trying to do the most important part about tengan is that he was really old and dying soon and that due to chisas influence he was convinced that munakata is just going to fuck the world even more with his kill everyone philosophy and he was completely opposed to him he had alreadly lost control of most of the organization to young powerhungry munakata and when he finally kicked the bucket the whole world would be basically in control of munakata and his despair waifu i think the point was that tengan was completely desperate due to lack of time and thought mitarais hypnosis was the only way to reverse the damage to the world at this point like naegi says its not just about the video itself he entrusted his hopes to mitarai which i guess he meant that tengan really wanted a successor of sorts to rule the new world order in his place since he was dying soon entrusting his hopes to the new generation and all that however mitarai himself wasnt sure about the hope video thing so he had to be forced into action with some real trauma that hit mitarai hard he made the game that way specifically to convince mitarai that someone like junko herself had once again used his work to kill a bunch of people to make his guilt go into overdrive and force his hand he had to hastily include him into the game because if he was absent everyone would assume he was the culprit cooperate together and the whole purpose would be ruined from his point of view a lot of people keep dying and a lot more people are going to die if munakata and chisa get to power so maybe he thought the lifes of executives or so was an acceptable tradeoff or something what really kills tengan is his total dearth of screentime especially when you compare him to munakata and mitarai we really should have seen more of how chisa slowly drove him insane over time pushed him into a corner and pit him and munakata against each other like junko alludes to in future so we could better understand his mentality and desperation maybe they thought the mastermind would be too obvious if they gave too much screentime to a guy that dies in episode but that excuse is pretty terrible considering even characters like fucking ruruka got more screentime than him and if they cant give us more screentime about him at the very least give us a better explanation than naegis guesses in one half of the episode and junkos quick recap in the other half motives for killing games in dr have always felt lackluster to me so maybe thats why i am so lenient about this at the very least we got a motive for kamukura being the mastermind in that was somewhat better than i just wanted to fuck around with junko for a bit
anime,not_removed,your points are pretty much how i feel about things monaca and the use of udg was fucking weird because they could have gone without it instead they basically gave a super brief nod to it but in the end it didnt matter at all considering who the final antagonist was they could have integrated udg in a much better manner such as by bringing up the old towa city conspiracy theories about how ff was corrupt there were some hints that kirigiri wasnt dead people guessed it ahead of time but it just felt unnecessary they didnt really do anything with it
anime,not_removed,its okay that you dont like the fact that kyoko lived but it wasnt an asspull the fact that she could still be somewhat alive was referenced back in episode she needed to be killed story wise for naegi to prove to munakata that he can keep up his resolve and platitudes even after going through a traumatic event which is something munakata couldnt do instead theyre just some deus ex machina you should have seen that coming when izuru was literary called that in the despair arc the guy is a super human
anime,not_removed,instead theyre just some deus ex machina i dont think you know what that means there was a ton of foreshadowing that the cast would come back and help just because they only played a major role in the end doesnt make it a deus ex machina deus ex machina ˌdāəs eks ˈmäkənəˌdāəs eks ˈmakənə noun an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation especially as a contrived plot device in a play or novel
anime,not_removed,that was the lamest copout ever and it just undermined her supposed sacrifice and the resulting motivation it gave naegi sore wa chigau yo her surviving was clearly forshadowed in the episode where she was found dead people picked up on the bottle and immediately suspected it was a cure it wasnt an asspull at all and as an added bonus the remnants moving into the building including the ultimate nurse makes it more believable
anime,not_removed,too much hope is bad
anime,not_removed,this is the finale to miraifuture arc
anime,not_removed,technically none of the deaths in actually happened edit elaborating a bit its because basically took place in a simulation and the people who died were really just put into a stasis
anime,not_removed,dying in the simulation didnt mean you died your brain just thought you did the game ends with the hope that all of the students could be awoken again especially nagito and mikan who died knowing they were just in a simulation so izuru figured out how to help everyone out their comatose state since hes the ultimate everything
anime,not_removed,the word you want is canon and danganronpa is the upcoming game which is a completely different school in the same universe theres already a synopsis and details of the characters released
anime,not_removed,it absolutely blows my mind that people are perfectly ok with the fact that a character took a magic makes me seem dead but am actually in a near dead state potion and showed up at the end at the last second that is soap opera tier writting but people are fine with it because muh waifu has to live httpsenwikipediaorgwikiantagonismchemistry in chemistry antagonism is a phenomenon wherein two or more agents in combination have an overall effect that is less than the sum of their individual effects the word is most commonly used in this context in biochemistry and toxicology interference in the physiological action of a chemical substance by another having a similar structure for instance a receptor antagonist is an agent that reduces the response that a ligand produces when the receptor antagonist binds to a receptor on a cell an example of this is the receptor antagonist the opposite of antagonism is synergy it is a negative type of synergism tldr its not magic its science dont know how you can think it was poorly writing when it was foreshadowed since episode
anime,not_removed,bringing back everyone they conceivably could chiaki and chisa are still dead all the future foundation members that died are still dead the only person they brought back was kirigiri and it was foreshadowed
anime,not_removed,i dont think the kirigiri thing is badly written at all the whole series is clicheedrenched so i dont see what the commotion is much worse is the adhoc introduction of the people the cast has to fight among other things
anime,not_removed,to be fair the flask was there as some kind of foreshadowing and also the happy ending was to be expected
anime,not_removed,you havent seen the previous reddit threads have you lots of people had faith that kirigiri was alive lol
anime,not_removed,the little medicine container was next to her when she died
anime,not_removed,i can agree with that i really did not want her dead but the reveal was a bitlackluster i found a dead person but then i revived her sweet i would have preferred kirigiri and mikan stumbling out at some point near the ruins and have everyone lose their shit that she was okay
anime,not_removed,oh fuck why did you remind me of this again
anime,not_removed,hey at least we have heterochromia shota now
anime,not_removed,heterchromia loli best girl
anime,not_removed,who
anime,not_removed,yeah they really didnt save irl chiaki rest in peace though her death wasnt peaceful at all at least they confirmed that ai chiaki made it but its still sad
anime,not_removed,she deserved it for murdering mukuro who is also still dead
anime,not_removed,thank god
anime,not_removed,so where my cast being revived
anime,not_removed,bless whoever made that
anime,not_removed,what did you link the video has been removed
anime,not_removed,did you watch the right thing these are from the hope finale so theyre not included in the despair or future episodes
anime,not_removed,dont be a mitarai dont run away anymore
anime,not_removed,i dont fault you its all straight downhill after that an episode or two after that is one of the most sadistic episodes ive ever seen
anime,not_removed,but theres the best episodes waiting for you i mean they are awful to watch but just because they are so emotionally hurtful not because they are bad
anime,not_removed,they havent built anything up they were pretty much just delivering backstory with despair arc and they just provided us with a conclusion to the question of what happened after
anime,not_removed,the creator already said we wont be seeing anyone again its the end of naegis story
anime,not_removed,i thought this too but why would he have a vertical scar across his eye its the only thing that doesnt match up
anime,not_removed,nice i didnt catch that
anime,not_removed,i dont remember this from the game but it sounds like something despair mikan would do
anime,not_removed,yup she does so either she has a robouterus or nothing at all now
anime,not_removed,they never said who took her reproductive organs
anime,not_removed,at this point an asspull was the best we could hope for
anime,not_removed,how was that an asspull that was pretty much the most obvious thing and makes perfect sense within the realm of danganronpa it would have been an asspull if chiaki was somehow alive
anime,not_removed,it wasnt even that it was foreshadowed back in episode
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,komaeda acquired junkos hand after danganronpa and shortly before ultra despair girls the robot hand was probably attached after the end of danganronpa maybe during the events of future arc as part of the recovery process after leaving the new world program
anime,not_removed,hmm nagito has junkos hands kuzuryuu her eye and mikan her uterus put them together summon forbidden exodia
anime,not_removed,oh thats why i dont remember havent played the game since it came out
anime,not_removed,i read somewhere that it is actually mukuros hand because they cant find junkos intact body and cant tell the difference for mukuros body
anime,not_removed,what about it
anime,not_removed,one popular theory now is that the gifted inmates prison high school from is actually hopes peak in the far far future i wouldnt be surprised at all if takes place like years in the future and some of those kids are descendants of the hopes peak cast
anime,not_removed,also half her body isnt purple and her eye isnt bleeding
anime,not_removed,the foreshadowing was there for sure that doesnt mean it wasnt added in right at the very end of production to make people less upset
anime,not_removed,im not sure whether chiakis revival will cause more hope or despair
anime,not_removed,id rather kyoko be dead and chiaki asspull her revival really i mean she has talent jesus and hopeman on her class
anime,not_removed,kirgiris revival is one thing because shes resourceful and smart enough to have at least tried to have figured out a way to survive the bullshit ng code which she obviously did bringing chiaki back would have been cop out bullshit
anime,not_removed,well given the nature of what hinata is if anybody in the world could have done it it would have been him plus the reveal of him being pretty much on the fence between hope and despair drastically changes things i dont think itd be too shocking for him to have set up something to back up their ingame memories outside of ai junkos view or the like
anime,not_removed,danganronpa which comes with is supposed to be exactly this ive heard
anime,not_removed,i agree with this
anime,not_removed,because they could have gone without it finishing the hpa story arc without addressing what monaca was doing would be just another plot hole
anime,not_removed,she needed to be killed story wise for naegi to prove to munakata that he can keep up his resolve and platitudes even after going through a traumatic event which is something munakata couldnt do yes her death proved to be important to the story and how its events panned out but the fact that they still make her live undermines that so much you should have seen that coming when izuru was literary called that in the despair arc the guy is a super human my problem is the cast being used only as a deus ex machina
anime,not_removed,are you sure i thought it was anime was a mistake
anime,not_removed,but i believe they mention in the game that if they died in the game their minds believed that they died so they actually died
anime,not_removed,ah and with the help of naegi they cleaned up their brains hence the op of or something well that clears things up thanks
anime,not_removed,fbr radical
anime,not_removed,and if he was also referring to the characters that died even with the uncertain future ending it was clear we would see everyone again
anime,not_removed,c u r e w u r e w
anime,not_removed,my problem isnt that she survived its that the reveal was so rushed and happened in the last minute of the episode
anime,not_removed,she was in a coma and the ultimate nurse helped her of course that makes sense i dont like her and would have been fine with her staying dead but it really is not an asspull
anime,not_removed,no saying man this shit was awful is not adding anything to a discussion at least say why you didnt like it
anime,not_removed,girl from despair arc one of the ones from the student council murder game
anime,not_removed,hey man hajimes a walking miracle worker now dude can probably just build a time travel machine and save her headcanondreams
anime,not_removed,mukuro best
anime,not_removed,the killing game in that is just so they can test the new version of cure w cure w version
anime,not_removed,retconning a ton of deaths is not welcome in a school environment
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,oh there is a hope didnt know that
anime,not_removed,i think you were just brainwashed into despair
anime,not_removed,maybe he cut it out when he woke up
anime,not_removed,the translation was something like someone tried to have sex with her corpse ops comment mentions what happened originally and was wrongfully translated
anime,not_removed,you can kinda get an idea by using your powers of deduction
anime,not_removed,i dont even care that this was the second lol one of most beloved character wasnt really dead we just wanted to crush you and force you into despair for a few daysweeks wasnt it better the second time i need to calm down
anime,not_removed,i actually thought they were gonna pull what the writer in ztd did with jamming something into the wristband to break off the needle when it tried to inject them with the poison
anime,not_removed,what her uterus
anime,not_removed,but mukuros entire body except for one arm was burned up as well which was her right hand with the fenrir tattoo on it nagitos junkos arm was a left arm with no tattoos
anime,not_removed,holy shit i hope so id love to see this and is going to be a day purchase for me
anime,not_removed,honestly its still an unfinished plot thread not a plot hole just an abandoned piece what happened to the other kids exactly heck even monaca shes just uh flying around space
anime,not_removed,yes her death proved to be important to the story and how its events panned out but the fact that they still make her live undermines that so much it doesnt really if anything it makes sense for kyokos character to not simply give up and let herself die even though it was a gamble and when you notice that the fact that she could live was hinted in epiode there is simply no way you can call that an asspull my problem is the cast being used only as a deus ex machina but they werent only used as that i mean we already got their development and story in and in the despair arc them saving the ff now in a way to atone for what they did yet also not being dragged down by their past mistakes like mitarai fit quite nicely with their character arcs
anime,not_removed,anime is a mistake and people that love anime will be the leading cause of the worlds ruin
anime,not_removed,mmhm but remember at the very end he said he would find a way to bring them back basically he did although we dont know his probably because its not very important how in the grand scheme of things
anime,not_removed,they also mention there was a chance for all of them to wake up
anime,not_removed,its been a while but i think ai junko was just playing with their emotions at that point either to get some fun out of raising up their hope and then destroying it or as a prelude to her fakes jumping in to push them to choose graduation
anime,not_removed,c o m p l e x m o t i v e s
anime,not_removed,best class really i dun like half of class but love all of
anime,not_removed,no it wasnt the how it was that it all happened in seconds i would have wanted it to have more of an impact
anime,not_removed,this is not the orange thread
anime,not_removed,so a new cure w that can revive people even after being made into butter
anime,not_removed,odd way to remove an eye
anime,not_removed,i know but since the game doesnt said it we never know
anime,not_removed,one of the ultimate despairsremnants took junkos reproductive organs and had them implanted the official translation phrases it as trying to have children with junkos body it being mikan specifically is basically just a theory
anime,not_removed,munakata is raiden though
anime,not_removed,sore wa chigau yo﻿ p mukuro has a fenrir tattoo on her right hand after junko was executed nagito cut off his left hand and put hers in its place
anime,not_removed,monaca gave up on hope and despair like her brother and became a neet simply put she was never fit to become junko we saw the other kids they were still alive and holding their own in towa it isnt unreasonable that they might get drafted into the new hopes peak
anime,not_removed,correction shes floating in space and brainwashed
anime,not_removed,and when you notice that the fact that she could live was hinted in epiode there is simply no way you can call that an asspull ill concede the fact that it was hinted at but it doesnt mean it wasnt awful writing but they werent only used as that i mean we already got their development and story in and in the despair arc them saving the ff now in a way to atone for what they did yet also not being dragged down by their past mistakes like mitarai fit quite nicely with their character arcs you just mentioned why they were deus ex machinas in this episode lol they could have played a bigger part in the events of miraihen but that was not the case as they only literally appeared at the finale
anime,not_removed,theres a bonus episode coming bundled with new danganronpa that will show all this what they saw when they died how they came back and how they ended up going to the ff from nagitos perspective
anime,not_removed,youre confused class is the cast of class cast of we dont know class
anime,not_removed,we dont care about your opinion so we downvote you its quite simple you do not deserve respect there are many interesting reasons that people can explain why they think that this ending was terrible or vice versa unfortunately your comment was much too stupid to express any of them heres how to improve explain what you liked and did not like accept that youre frustrated give us a reason to like your opinion why so you can have people see where you come from and by doing so you gain validation from others you cant gain respect without respecting the people who read your comment
anime,not_removed,sorry man reference flew right by me whats orange
anime,not_removed,hey if monokuma can turn someone into a robot why cant medicine turn mondo into a butter golem
anime,not_removed,yeah should be like an uchiha and pluck it out
anime,not_removed,do we know who tried to fuck her dead body because that part threw me through a loop in
anime,not_removed,mukuros left hand was burned up so nagito couldnt have done that
anime,not_removed,yeah i was worried they were dead
anime,not_removed,but it doesnt mean it wasnt awful writing i could see your point if it was an asspull but it wasnt not only it makes sense for kyokos character to not simply give up and wait for her death but it also posthumously completes seikos character arc very well while giving mikan time to shine just a reminder fan pandering bad writing you just mentioned why they were deus ex machinas in this episode lol more like izuru was the class was only there because of him after all its kind of funny since he is called that in the despair arc anyway my point was that they werent only that for the series they could have played a bigger part in the events of miraihen mirai hen just wasnt about them though we at least got hints that they were coming so it wasnt from nowhere but that was not the case as they only literally appeared at the finale a couple of episodes of miraihen hint that they were on the move so youre wrong on that
anime,not_removed,if its just minutes of monologuing about hope and friendship in a wonky evangelionlike bullshit of abstractness im going to be seriously pissed
anime,not_removed,the anime drama in which people invent a time machine to save an old friend
anime,not_removed,to be fair that was inside of a game
anime,not_removed,i would guess teruteru just a hunch
anime,not_removed,no both versions of that line specifically dont mention anyone in particular technically we dont even know fuyuhikos the one who took her eye
anime,not_removed,ah thanks man is it any good
anime,not_removed,i mean you could do thatbut the timeline would change to the beta timeline and youd have to get back into the alpha timeline cause beta timeline is fucked el psy congroo ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
anime,not_removed,if you can buy into the premise it is not bad it is based on one of the highest rated manga but if you dont like ep it doesnt change in tone
anime,not_removed,no by game i meant the new world program being a virtual world it allows monokuma to easily do impossible stuff like turning a student into a cyborg or making some giant robot beasts or even the obnoxiouslooking fun house
anime,not_removed,i am mad scientist

anime,not_removed,nobody has seen this show which is good because its trash but if someone could defend id love to hear it the characters were bad even by harem standards the most boring directing and background art i have ever seen actors are below average heavily dated episodic story is terrible for a slice of life one decent song and for an ecchi show the actual fanservice was mild at best and severely lacking in creativity its undefendable

anime,not_removed,k honestly it was just an eyecandy mess for me
anime,not_removed,hibike euphonium
anime,not_removed,time for some satire the second coming of jesus is a misinterpretation of revelation it in fact refers to the of revelation occurs in the past greece is hellas satan has his throne in pergamum lydia apollyon the destroyer etc and the references to persian kings from the east cyrus ii defeated croesus of lydia and cyrus is dream about cambysses i the new heaven and earth and judgement of the dead simply refer to the end of wars there will be no more death the old things have disappeared and those who took part being judged according to their actions its really an allegory about the repetitive nature of history warfare bloodshed etc beasts are actually kingsrulerstyrants not mythical creatures as evidenced in they are also kings

anime,not_removed,toaru kagaku no railgun
anime,not_removed,kill la kill little witch academia
anime,not_removed,sao money probably made your lie in april possible
anime,not_removed,its success validated idea of making shitty adaptations of lns thus we eventually got mahouka so its not necessarily second coming of jesus but rather second john the baptist
anime,not_removed,its awesome as hell and asuna is a top tier waifu i personally think the fight in episode of sao will be remembered for a long time its easily the defining moment of the entire show for me and i think that if you asked a person what the most iconic scenes of the were they would put that on there
anime,not_removed,theres a reason why a ton of people watch it and it gets talked about a lot its not good and covers every cliche but its sort of like the trash pop music that plays on the radio its universally catchy and that in itself has value a lot of people have seen it and a lot of people have finished it it also has a top tier ost and a ton of production value its generic pop trash and probably the best anime at being so
anime,not_removed,because of its success log horizon and konosuba were possible
anime,not_removed,it singlehandedly revitalized the market for english translations of light novels in fact i would even go so far as to say that a nonln series the legend of galactic heroes novels is being brought over because of sao paving the way
anime,not_removed,they perfectly well knew what they were doing when they created the concept and collected their basic ideas they made something befitting its time it was just one step tomorrow but something that felt like it was graspable for viewers and it was very accessible there was no heavy thinking or philosophy involved it was something to lean back and enjoy mindlessly and it had a concept that albeit sort of done before but not so much many viewers were looking for it has a general setup that makes for an interesting story and a lot of the production while made rather by format than by originality and creativity made it more accessible too was quite good stuff like animation didnt come with giraffe necks and other typical errors the character designs werent bad either etc in other words they tried to make something of good production quality with an easy story that would be watchable to everyone tldr has mass appeal and could have been good if kirito wasnt such an awful mary sue
anime,not_removed,sao made me feel more comfortable to tell people about my incestuous acts with my brother
anime,not_removed,without sao there will not be saoa
anime,not_removed,there are so many reasons why this show is a blessing a it actually centers around adults with realistic fears and desires b it portrays a romance that doesnt rely on tropes or bl conventions to happen and the two characters actually have chemistry and tension c its a sports anime made by people who actually seem to be in love with the sport they are portraying d it constantly twists the audiences expectations by masterfully playing with what people expect from fujoaimed anime especially in regards to the characters this is especially a godsend when so many other anime seem to be just following the leaders in their designated genres instead yoi paves its own path that will probably affect a lot of shows in the future and finally e it has a great plot twist that completely defied how people saw the show up to that point so basically the second coming of jesus especially with it selling so well like jesus i hope it does indeed affect the future
anime,not_removed,along with everything that rarietty said its also pretty darn funny especially during the first few episodes but there were also a bunch of scenes after that that made me giggle im a pork cutlet bowl fatale that enthralls men will never stop being funny and the skating routine music is great
anime,not_removed,heres what i wrote when i first got back into anime personally i hope it will encourage more similar shows since theres a massive lack of naturalfeeling gay relationships in anime
anime,not_removed,thanks to its success studios will continue to produce fujobait shows like rakugo and acca without the goddamned harem cast structure
anime,not_removed,the german dub is hillarious when i watched bible black with a bunch of friends we had to stop multiple times because two guys actually started to tear up from laughter the dub featured not only clunky translation but shit like a voice actor literally phoning it in the voice actress of a girl from one episode to the next getting swapped out ith a male va and people misprouncing names sometimes it was a good laugh
anime,not_removed,bible black is the second cumming of jesus
anime,not_removed,but it made people appreciate ghost in the shell even more now by comparison
anime,not_removed,they had really cool guns
anime,not_removed,why dont you like it
anime,not_removed,it created a setting without going into areas that were too over the top and opened questions but let the viewers answer them it never gave a definite answer to the question whether this kind of security was good or bad it presented both sides so to start a discussion instead of a lesson about something we already know however it did deliver quite the impactful warning not to rely too much on what we think we have but always remember to think on our own and develop what we have instead of believing we will forever be safe with what we have
anime,not_removed,its a kids show in a post apocalyptic setting geez and even more it also shows a bit of pragmatic thinking for kids even if its kinda bullshit
anime,not_removed,the op is way better than it has any right to be
anime,not_removed,its a nice comfy relaxing show the characters are likeable enough and its just an enjoyable ride and yet even with how nice and lighthearted it is there are still darker ideas on the horizon ones that dont overpower the show and allow it to fulfill its own little niche
anime,not_removed,no one does but we all love it your supposed to feel as confused as shinji intially is and you wont understand it until youve written a couple of university thesis about it
anime,not_removed,thank you for admitting that you dont understand it rather than convincing yourself that your lack of understanding means its impossible to understand or is actually nonsense
anime,not_removed,eva is nowhere near as hard to understand as people claim and gets carried even through poor production at times by excellent characterization everyone in the show who gets any focus is a distinctly human character each with their own different faults goals and emotional baggage no matter who it is in the show you know where they are coming from and why they are who they are further the sense of dread and mystery behind nerv and its true purpose is masterfully built up through subtle suggestion really clever show but it takes some work
anime,not_removed,piloting a decepticon mech fight his way through space zerg when idol music playing in the background if jesus will ever return to us at all this is how he gonna show up
anime,not_removed,gave birth to lion which is one of the most iconic anime song here in japan at least
anime,not_removed,the music is god damned immaculate klanklan best girl and it had some of the most seamless wellexecuted for its time too bad the main characters are complete garbage especially ranka
anime,not_removed,multiple cool looking gundams fantastic ops light on the deaths that matter shared spotlight on main characters and best of all ships
anime,not_removed,the mc bedded both of the main heroines and got one pregnant i watched the anime and later read the manga of this absolute shitfest and thats the only good thing about it
anime,not_removed,i keep on trying to watch it but never get anywhere into it im not sure why tbh
anime,not_removed,it has the greatest plot twist ending since doom repercussions of evil
anime,not_removed,it made me realize that deep down there are worse things than fatestay night exponentially increasing my enjoyment of the fate series
anime,not_removed,it is a superblywritten show that handles its characters themes and pacing flawlessly despite the relatively short runtime the art style is also perfect for the realistic story its telling and the overthetop action its conveying in a medium that is typically packed with knockoffs and cliches its a saving grace you were talking about this right just double checking because that was the last show i was expecting to show up in this thread its incredibly easy to call it the second coming of christ in terms of anime because i dont think there has been a show released since ping pong that has reached ping pongs heights
anime,not_removed,millennium actress the show tells the story of the main character while paying homage to the japanese cinema smartly theres always a parallel between the movies that the mc plays in and her personal feelings the ending is topnotch and will make everyone cry
anime,not_removed,lovely complex a neat look at the life of a very tall girl versus a shortish boy also one of the few times in a romance anime where the character has a kansaiben osaka accents
anime,not_removed,well im no expert of anime but i love me a good romcom and lovely complex handles its characters superbly by my count also the blond boy made me cry from laughter
anime,not_removed,lovely complex i havent watched many romcom but i absolutely loved this show it has great character interactions decent comedy an amazing op and a great va that only played one character in this show and some kids show and never appeared again
anime,not_removed,millennium actress ima dissapointed son jk but seriously millenium actress sets itself in a unique category i really cant see any movie or tv series that focuses on female endeavor in classic japan in pursuit for her beloved stranger not even ghibli heroines get this sense of acomplishment troughout their stories not to mention that this is probably the only animated movie that has provided a new sense of story immersion for us the viewers i think only one episode of the latest shouwa genroku rakugo shinjuu has come close to what satoshi kon did with millenium actress years ago
anime,not_removed,a finished series with s an actual harem ending and a sexually active main character its everything ranime years for
anime,not_removed,its ost
anime,not_removed,its literally the second coming of jesus
anime,not_removed,regular content for ranimeirl
anime,not_removed,allowed the creation of my favourite
anime,not_removed,kouko is a wonderful character to look at over the course of the series she starts off being insufferable and rather insane and over the series she actively forces herself to try and be a better girlfriend because she understands that her behavior will push away anyone she cares about but fuck ghost banri
anime,not_removed,its like a roller coaster that starts at mph and doubles in speed every episode not very exciting at first but its a crazy ride when youre going mph
anime,not_removed,erased has a unique level of story telling that i have never seen in anime you always thought something was going to happen then have that thought be nullified only to have it happen when you least expected it i have never sat through an anime that had me yelling at my tv as much as erased accomplished although the ending was terribly rushed
anime,not_removed,it told quite the suspenseful story and touched some very real and dark topics without degrading them to edgy stuff like other anime do that just want to be dark
anime,not_removed,people go on about how obvious the ending was yes it was a bit rushed but the show is not about us working out who the killer is its about the mc doing it they make it pretty clear with all the obvious hints they throw at us right from the start getting more and more obvious as we get closer to the end
anime,not_removed,they seem really cool and are a blast to watch if youre fourteen
anime,not_removed,attack on titan changed something in the way i look at fiction i realized there is no adventure happy time and that there is trauma and how intriguing it can be once trauma is considered by the writers and it was full of trauma but none of it felt fake it did a really good job at transporting the darkness the characters feel to the viewer how hopeless of a situation it is and how you cant always take the right way
anime,not_removed,looks beautiful had a decent story
anime,not_removed,ok now you triggered me spoilers duh k is my object of worship and my preferred pronoun it is a story about the old word and its endless need for power vs the new world values of friends being the most important thing s it shows a bourgeoise who has his memory wiped out and finds out that the old values arent as important even though he founded them he is trying to keep peace in the upper levels of society while sacrificing himself that makes it literally the second coming of jesus the graphics are made with extreme precision and thoughtfulness mostly the oppai shows extreme enthusiasm and excitement to tell the story of oppressed and of redemption and rebirth as saviour so once again it is the coming of christ and done anyway i just thought it was pretty above average anime if you care to watch it again with stunning visuals and interesting story
anime,not_removed,kyoto animation
anime,not_removed,with a couple exceptions the character interactions are really natural due to the writing voice acting and use of silence it has an overarching story of growth as a group through musical performance and pursuit of a goal that mirrors the individual students comingofage subplots looks amazing but you knew that already
anime,not_removed,unlike most anime the characters feel real and not cardboard cutouts of different tropes
anime,not_removed,oi who doesnt like yuribait and blue balls
anime,not_removed,but why call it revelation then if it wasnt anything new
anime,not_removed,bruh
anime,not_removed,asuna is okay i guess
anime,not_removed,the scene where the girl forgot her name lol basically races against the camera is great filmmaking
anime,not_removed,its a very comfortable growing up movie
anime,not_removed,legs
anime,not_removed,amen
anime,not_removed,symphogear is hype the action is just a blast to watch the music is phenomenal nana mizuki is a gem the characters are fun and all have great chemistry together seriously though i love the way the characters just pull out big weapons out of nowhere it makes all the combat so dynamic and over the top and i appriciate the show for not getting bogged down with too much fanservice romance or being too moe it understands its an action show first
anime,not_removed,i didnt love it but i can say some things i thought were neat about it shinkai and his wife voice acted the two leads making it a pretty romantic story on a deeper level especially when combined with shinkai basically doing all the art writing song writing cgi etc by himself i also liked the way it played with concepts of lightspeed travel effect on humans even if it wasnt the first thing to do it
anime,not_removed,looks gorgeous nice ost and tells an unconventional romance with a little twist and some scenes that carry some weight in under mins
anime,not_removed,it creates jobs for some people
anime,not_removed,its something ranime can make fun of without anyone getting salty about it
anime,not_removed,it is an aggressively mediocre series that gave birth to railgun which is a much better series also the railgun and accelerator mangas are awesome
anime,not_removed,we can all praise the sun together when season comes out
anime,not_removed,our lives would be different without the onoderas
anime,not_removed,the cutest character designs
anime,not_removed,oh that was really good in the beginning but yeah the ending sort of just happened i think it was a really awesome and diffrent tournament style anime
anime,not_removed,the fan service aint bad specially when its from the blond girl
anime,not_removed,cute lolis and explosions
anime,not_removed,fanservice
anime,not_removed,my little witch academia mixing series together now
anime,not_removed,so far it feels a bit like a growing process akko isnt just a standard moe or genki girl shes a child and she acts like one too and by that i mean she can be really rash and childish in ways that arent good and she is confronted with the consequences too which finally leads to her learning and maturing but in a much slower much more subtle way if it keeps going like this the series is going to end with an akko who can deal with things properly and has the power to fulfill her dream instead of just running against a wall repeatedly and all of that through a development process that seems perfectly natural
anime,not_removed,amazing animation and music so pretty to look at if nothing else
anime,not_removed,the nature of the apocalypse virus was really intriguing by the time you reach the end i realized its what you would get if you combined httpmetroidwikiacomwikiphazon and tiberium from command conquer httpcncwikiacomwikitiberium
anime,not_removed,one word egoist
anime,not_removed,its really something i cant say why i enjoyed it so much i just did
anime,not_removed,great romance focused on the insecurities of all the cast with an onpoint soundtrack that provides the right mood every time and it doesnt require episodes for the couple to actually hold hands not to mention it uses great analogies between humans and cats
anime,not_removed,well first of all the series changes a lot in tone more emotions and stuff thought id let you know angel beats started weird ill admit that for a big amount of time it was insanely funny and for a big amount of time it was insanely sad and there wasnt really much inbetween there are some characters and stories that really hit home and while it has flaws its those moments when it really hits your soul that make this series worthwhile because all the same you dont only cry with these characters you laugh with them and thats how you start feeling closer
anime,not_removed,ignoring the first anime since ive been told by countless people to skip it myself the more recent book of circus anime which requires no real knowledge of the previous series to jump into beyond basic familiarity with some characters since it follows the manga is an amazing dark and twisted story that leaves you wondering whether the protagonist is really the one you should be rooting for or not all of the characters are complex and sympathetic in their own rights and the animation and character designs are flatout gorgeous it covers one of the better arcs in the manga which is also an amazing ride if you enjoy manga the fandom gives the impression that the series is nothing but shouta fanservice which put me off of reading it for a long time but that couldnt be further from the truth
anime,not_removed,i loved how mirai nikki used the yandere trope to such an extreme come on thats why people watch mirai nikki but really it wasnt just oh shes super psycho there was more thought behind it than most people seem to realize there was what i like to call a pull and push first a pull the dere something to lure the viewer in or give him a feeling of safety then shock them with something that really pushes them away which is to say the yan part this scheme worked pretty well in my opinion making yuno as lovable and shocking at the same time what with all the yuno is my waifu people and also all the what the fuck moments in the anime generallythe anime is somewhere beyond good and evil for me beyond quality and flawed it doesnt just cross the line it exists only past the line in a way a story like that is fascinating but only for some it seems which is what i think is the reason for this entire hate it or love it deal with mirai nikki
anime,not_removed,ok this is a response i wrote in another thread explaining why i think mika wouldve been a better main character than yuu but it also addresses what i like the show as a whole in addition to the that point the art style is stunning obviously this is going to be subjective but the cast has some of my favorite character designs and art whenever i look for shows i basically look for shows that look like seraph of the end bright colors stunning eyes dark lines high contrast with beautiful painted backgrounds stunning fluid action sequences the openings and endings are some of my favorite period
anime,not_removed,code geass one of the most iconic anime characters ever made lelouch is filled to the brim with style and charisma and he is what gives code geass its life force the plot of the series is over the top and it flows amazingly well with lelouchs over the top character pair this with a few really done moments and a lot of emotion and youve got a classic basically lelouch and the energy and emotion that code geass have takes it a huge step above most shows
anime,not_removed,code geass its fun to see op guy failing at everything due to his overconfidence also this kind of mc who just wants to make a spectacle out of his every move is something that should be more common because its just freaking fun steinsgate movie kurisu is cute
anime,not_removed,haikyuu season tsukki
anime,not_removed,hiroyuki imaishi is a god damn god and is direction style is second to none in my opinion the art style of all of his shows and the way the animation flows in them is charming to no end praise be to imaishi praise be
anime,not_removed,its very thematically sound it has great animation and it has a great soundtrack hiroyuki imaishi is a great director in general really ryuuko and satsuki are both interesting characters senketsu is a really cool idea to me and i think that a lot of the comedy moments are really funny basically it combines a really well written story with a fucking awesome hype story
anime,not_removed,you stated all the characters other than ryuko werent interesting in the slightest the story was more or less of an excuse plot it couldnt seem to settle on a particular theme the animation just felt choppy and poor it really seems like trigger ran out of money while making this but mfw the anime actually has compelling characters mfw the story was actually fun at times and had a consistent theme mfw it is literaly has some of the most inventive and creative animation in any anime ever mfw i read your comment
anime,not_removed,if any of you were to look through my previous posts you could see that i hate this anime with a passion httpsiimgurcomqzpwsrbpng do you uhh want to talk about your problems or
anime,not_removed,it overlewed to the point where by the end the lewdness didnt even effect me anymore which was a really cool theme the show had been working on the entire time also kick ass soundtrack and character design
anime,not_removed,the action scenes are usually pretty good off the top of my head at least
anime,not_removed,characters are interesting have dedicated semiintricate back stories the first meeting between meliodas and ban is goddamned hilarious perfect mix between action and comedy well animated and it has one of the most useful mascot characters ive ever seen but i suppose you people would prefer terrible absolutely shit tier shounen like one piece
anime,not_removed,thankk you for pointing out that its actually bad cant understand how it has in mal
anime,not_removed,mabo tofu
anime,not_removed,a tenshi named kanade announcing the arrival of our lord and saviour otonashi yuzuru
anime,not_removed,its the first story ive seen to make me feel afraid of the supernatural and made a proper vampire intimidating sure he has all sorts of insane zombie surgery and ice powers but hes also mysterious alluring powerful and charismatic he actually feels like an inhuman creature trying to transcend humanity its a perfect gothic vampire story with johnathan as the good and humble protagonist up against forces he cannot understand i like that the story begins in childhood and its the execution that makes it so intense then it turns into a mystery eventually building up into this epic journey to kill dio johnathan didnt bother me like a lot of other idealist characters because he had the resolve to kill dio rather than bitch and moan about it or hesitate in what he needed to do he didnt feel hypocritical even if he was stupidly forgiving of random thugs assaulting him in the middle of the street and it did turn out to be his downfall when it came to dio in the end i think dio is better in phantom blood than dio in stardust crusaders because his motivations are clearer and hes a much more active antagonist i dislike when people just think of this as only being good because it brought better things along later its my second favourite part battle tendency is my number one because its an old school style shounen battle system of supernatural martial arts that always brought unexpected and insane opponents to fight later parts with stands felt more formulaic and arcs were just based on setting up situations where assassins come after the heroes as they traveled and stand powers are always so weirdly specific in how they work but phantom blood really built up dio from his childhood to be a villain
anime,not_removed,johnathan is a good and likeable character but worst jojo dio is a good villain but pales in comparison to kira and the main villains of part and i like the dracula meets fist of the north star setup and its also where the whole jojo saga started years ago
anime,not_removed,railgun s it gave us the sisters arc from misakas perspective which made it one of the most impactful arcs in any anime ive watched railgun if kuroko is your girl this season was good if you didnt like herher voice then im not sure i can convince you otherwise i liked her dynamic with misaka when she wasnt all over her metaphorical dick and even when she was she wasnt that unbearable i like dumb gags sometimes you know
anime,not_removed,even more reason to hate jk i think shigatsu was good but it is stupidly overrated at deserves a lower score but still good
anime,not_removed,it made it possible for me to get english translated lns so i feel indebted to them
anime,not_removed,its success validated idea of making shitty adaptations of lns thus we eventually got mahouka so wheres the good part
anime,not_removed,except you know adaptations of lns was relatively popular thing even before sao
anime,not_removed,its success validated idea of making shitty adaptations of lns thus we eventually got mahouka john the baptist are you saying tatsuya shiba is jesus kaniedisgust
anime,not_removed,what fight was that again
anime,not_removed,top tier my ass she barely did anything and had next to no characterization aside from her fall to be a useless damsel in distress
anime,not_removed,really i felt yuri on ice relied heavily on a lot of yaoi tropes albeit a little calmer lol
anime,not_removed,here are some more his plan didnt work and that wouldve made everything make sense
anime,not_removed,i get what you mean its popularity allowed alot of people entry into the medium but honestly i thought the show wasnt anywhere near the hype there are much better sports anime if thats what you are interested in and also much better romance anime including malemale relationships a recent example from this year being doukyuusei
anime,not_removed,how is acca fujobait
anime,not_removed,why were you watching bible black with your mates
anime,not_removed,i found it to be a very shallow show despite on how it presents itself ie it makes sure that you know that what the characters quote is deep and that the one who said it was smart it speaks big words and throws concepts like transhumanism with that cyborg dude just to barely touch on them or presenting them as cool characters like sniper girl added nothing to the plot but theres a whole episode dedicated to her and to set up an arc that never gets touched upon again and apart from ginoza and his dad i didnt find any of them to be memorable sybil has no inworld reason to exist the show tells you that it needed to be implemented to preserve order but then it shows you that its literally hell on earth and flawed from the start but everyone just accepts it ironically the one that wants to take it down isnt affected by it but wants to kill thousands for his goals hypocritical much theres not even an explanation on how the world transitioned to that system s hell even after the big reveal where its obvious that sybil should be akane does nothing to change it the sequel hook also left a sour taste in my mouth
anime,not_removed,how did it present both sides whats the silver lining of its system i thought sybil was just terrible all around
anime,not_removed,did you name your thesis a cruel angels thesis
anime,not_removed,its hard to understand but its not impossible i bought the guidebook and that cleans up everything evangelion is not nonsense its actually amazing how when you dig down its actually masterfully made evangelion tries to confuse you and you will amazing time while trying to understand it i admit i dont understand it but im not really confused anymore and can understand the story to its full potential and god damn its good
anime,not_removed,macross frontier live concerts are some of the best anime concerts ever recorded
anime,not_removed,you forgot best girl
anime,not_removed,lmao
anime,not_removed,yes it remains as my lowest completed anime for now
anime,not_removed,very tall shortish the girls on the upper band of average and the guys a complete dwarf
anime,not_removed,good point you can even go a step above by pointing out s it has siscon elements and he bangs her in the op
anime,not_removed,greatest inappropriatelyplaced jazz music ever
anime,not_removed,jesus more like the arrival of shiva i get the point though
anime,not_removed,eh kaniedisgust
anime,not_removed,even though i havent seen it i know what happens by watching it frame by frame through ranimeirl
anime,not_removed,dude you like ice cream
anime,not_removed,but its a crazy ride when youre going mph
anime,not_removed,i love battle shounen though i enjoy naruto and even fucking bleach but those two and shounen are a years target in general
anime,not_removed,like every second anime is a drama about some trauma i dont see how aot is special
anime,not_removed,and neko dont forget neko
anime,not_removed,apokalypsos revealing there is a secret within that book to be revealed but its a long story it takes hours to explain armageddon refers to the conflict between cyrus ii and the greek states
anime,not_removed,sao abridged is a gem though
anime,not_removed,id like some reasoning on this myself
anime,not_removed,someone link that scene from here please
anime,not_removed,and i was just trying to disagree with you about lovely complex have an upvote dammit
anime,not_removed,nice way to spell chitoge
anime,not_removed,oops thanks
anime,not_removed,okay yeah its pretty but feels so edgy preteeny and edgy but yeah those aspects are good
anime,not_removed,the art and animation are great ill give you that studio wit doing its job welland i like the character designs too especially krul also i got sheet music for the opening however all that you wrote doesnt really do anything for the problem i had with the anime that you even seem to agree on at least to an extent yuu is such an awful character hes just oh so awesome and everyone loves him i remember seeing episode and then thinking s so this was an episode about everyone indirectly confessing their love to yuu and being too dumb to turn on the fucking light mika is the only character that ever showed potential and im afraid he can never live up to it if hes surrounded by flat characters that are defined by one character trait
anime,not_removed,drunk kurisu is best
anime,not_removed,hiroyuki imaishi is a god damn god in the name of our lord and savior amen
anime,not_removed,direction style is second to none
anime,not_removed,well its cool as hell but i wouldnt go so far as to say its got the most creative and original animation ever its not something like ping pong the animation where its a style thats never existed its definitely a style that imaishi pioneered but hes used it across like or works now plus i definitely think he picked up the style when he worked on flcl i will admit that kill la kill is where he kinda perfected it if you dont consider that gurren lagann
anime,not_removed,it couldnt seem to settle on a particular theme the major theme was duality and not being idealogically rigid which is why it jumped back and forth between opposing themes in pairs of episodes
anime,not_removed,ryuko coming into terms with her stripperific battle gear cleverly parallels how you as a viewer are first baffled by the amount of skin shown and a few episodes later you wont even notice it because of how awesome all the action is kill la kill is one of the rare shows where the fanservice if you wish to call it that is there to compliment the other aspects instead of the generic fanservice pile shows where other aspects of anime exist just as a vessel for the fanservice
anime,not_removed,dont lose your wayyyyyyy
anime,not_removed,one pieces characters are more interesting than nanatsus their backstories are much better and more developed than nanatsus the comedy in one piece is wayyyyy better than anything in nanatsu ok you win the animation part chopper is much better than hawk and a lot more useful although im not sure if you would call chopper a mascot also calling one piece terrible absolutely shit tier shounen means that you claim that its the worst shounen worse than yuyuhakusho naruto bleach and even fairy tail which is simply laughable
anime,not_removed,good characters very over the top action and its funny i think its a great starter anime for people to find out what they like and dont like
anime,not_removed,i guess the expanded sisters arc was good but its probably the only arc of railgun i liked the animeoriginal filler was boring and i didnt really like the adapted manga arcs either kuroko is basically railguns index and uiharu was way more forgettable than a character like her should be imo
anime,not_removed,stupidly overrated highly disagree to that
anime,not_removed,yeah it is overrated still good though
anime,not_removed,the good part is in that mahouka was quite good animey and it made me read lns which are like opm but actually good and full of technobabble the joke part is in that mahouka is about second coming of jesus hence the baptist thing
anime,not_removed,yes yes i do tho i guess its not entirely true hes nicknamed after some hinduism deity
anime,not_removed,first time kirito uses his other sword
anime,not_removed,character quality doesnt matter if youre cute
anime,not_removed,doukyuusei is the only other example and its recent i recently posted on both ranime and ranimesuggest asking for shows like this and literally the only response was doukyuusei if you think theres a lot more out there id love to hear it
anime,not_removed,oh i felt like they really presented it being an incredible safety standard sybil wasnt terrible all around it helped prevent a lot of crime to the point where people could just leave their doors unlocked without worry it most certainly reduced the crime rate to a minimum
anime,not_removed,maybe
anime,not_removed,whew im glad im not alone in my opinion that ping pong was only meh
anime,not_removed,in japan the boy would be around average girl height and the girl would be at around average boy height
anime,not_removed,in the op more like in the actual show
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomyyeonfsjpg
anime,not_removed,far from the most egregious character in that show tho
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,i cant say im a fan of shitoge
anime,not_removed,naoko yamada i love yamada along with kyoanis other usual suspects takemoto and ishihara as much as the next person but its not even close for me
anime,not_removed,it is absolutely worse than all of those you listed hell the art alone is bad enough to make it practically unwatchable and thats before its completely retarded story lines and terrible characters its the most formulaic poorly developed shounen ever even when put up against the other pieces of shit you listed
anime,not_removed,it looks and sounds good but come on the writing is atrocious
anime,not_removed,i mean if the show has a reason to be overrated and that show has many reasons
anime,not_removed,the anime was bull for me the mc came off as a total show off and the girls really would just get theirs wet just breathing the same air as him
anime,not_removed,peasants
anime,not_removed,ah that fight it was a big asspull imo i think that if you asked a person what the most iconic scenes of the were they would put that on there maybe if you ask people who have watched less than anime
anime,not_removed,youve done good my boy
anime,not_removed,i only gave it a s i liked kongs development but peco powering up and defeating everyone else kinda ruined it for me
anime,not_removed,does he actually i was afraid of saying that it happened in the show because i cant remember it too well i do remember s edgy almost getting molested by rabbit girl though
anime,not_removed,this should always be the answer to symphogear doubters
anime,not_removed,i see what you did there but i cant say i like it
anime,not_removed,fair enough i love imaishi but its certainly not my favorite id say naoko yamada is definitely one of the most talented directors ive seen yet and i cant wait to see what she does next
anime,not_removed,dont make such face there are worse things some people deify madoka
anime,not_removed,ive seen its definitely not something i would put in the top moments of all time but its still a stand out moment for anime of the and certainly a stand out moment for the isekai genre i kinda want to take it back now the fight was cool as hell but i think i just remember it more fondly than most people because i watched it when i was like
anime,not_removed,im with you guys i gave it a the odd anime style was unnecessary imo and detracted from the rather decent story it told
anime,not_removed,yes sure it happened someone here recently asked what episode it was and i went and checked i think it was episode
anime,not_removed,my day just started and im in class now so i cant make a list of scenes but it is i think i could get at least before using sao and i like sao
anime,not_removed,i dislike ping pong not because its bad but being a table tennis player myself some things just looks atrocious and it ticks me off more than usual
anime,not_removed,oh shit now i remember dont they mention like seconds prior that s they arent bloodrelated that was hilarious
anime,not_removed,yeah youre probably right
anime,not_removed,yep that also happened x
anime,not_removed,now i see your edit what you said makes sense
anime,not_removed,you watch end of evangelion now the rebuild movies are a completely separate series
anime,not_removed,youre not finished until you watch end of evangelion
anime,not_removed,watch end of evangelion then if you feel like it the rebuild series
anime,not_removed,havent watched it myself but im pretty sure you watch end of evangelion next and then the rebuilds
anime,not_removed,if you want to do it the way gainax did after you watch end of evangelion you can watch oruchuban ebichu and flcl to really switch gears no theyre not related to nge at all but they did keep the staff from going bananas
anime,not_removed,on another note did shinji just fucking masturbate to an hospitalized girl in the first four minutes wtf shinjimug
anime,not_removed,it depends who you ask as panda said it is closer to the original ending that was supposed to happen if the studio had enough time and budget by the end of the production it is certainly a must see in my opinion if you even remotely liked the show watch the movie as soon as possible in order to avoid spoilers i would be happy to share my interpretation with you after you have watched the movie if you are interested but you will likely find better written analysis online definitely watch the movie before you do any research though
anime,not_removed,its supposed to be the correct ending where they didnt have their budget slashed and just made stuff up at the end that being said dont expect any answers
anime,not_removed,dont expect any answers but plenty of hugs and free beverages
anime,not_removed,in response to you asking if end of evangelion was an alternate ending to the show i say no it was not what we see in the show and in the movie are two ways to visualize the same thing in the show we see instrumentality from only shinjis perspective in the movie we see instrumentality take place externally and affecting everyone simultaneously in the show we see shinji verbally acknowledge his self worth and reject instrumentality but in the movie we see him physically reject it literally breaking free from it
anime,not_removed,as i understand it everyone has to make their own decision to rematerialize as an individual self at the end of the movie we only know for sure that asuka and shiji made that choice now if shinji never made that initial rejection would everyone else still have that choice i am not entirely sure to be honest i think it would be safe to assume that there was significance to shinji emerging from the giant rei so perhaps he was the one to allow all humans to escape instrumentality if they so desire
anime,not_removed,it must have been great or terrible for the people who were watching it without any preconceived notions the first episode hints at deeper meaning when you are confronted with shinjis relationship with his father but nothing really prepares you for what you get out of the last few episodes its my all time favorite series by far i am still hoping to find something that will come close
anime,not_removed,i thought it was very good i watched it once dubbed and another time subbed both times were great if you havent seen it seto no hanayome is very similar in style and is also fun to watch
anime,not_removed,while this is a good comedy i also recommend grand blue not yet animated it is one of the finest gem out there same author as baka to test
anime,not_removed,watched sub one of the best comedy animes along with daily life of high school boys
anime,not_removed,i didnt love it but i did quite enjoy it its one of the few series where its extreme absurdist comedy and constant sight gags actually feel like they work i enjoyed the dub too but particularly because it uses a ton of funimation regulars but aggressively casts them against type josh grelle is usually a sarcastic not this bullshit again straight man in bt hes an excitable idiot jamie marchi is usually a brash shameless and flirty archetype in bt shes an extremely softspoken reserved yandere leah clark often turns up as dry sedate or detached characters see kobayashi this season but shes bts violent tsundere lead alexis tipton is bubbly sweet and innocent most of the time kurumi and rika notwithstanding and she does get to play that in bt but her darker streak might even be scarier than the yandere or the tsundere in the cast brina palencia as best trap who adamantly opposes his trap status and best traps sister
anime,not_removed,hideyoshi best girl btw
anime,not_removed,i watched the sub and dub both are equally good it was consistently hilarious almost from the very start and is one of my favourites
anime,not_removed,this is one of my favorite comedy anime ever such a funny cast and the best trap ever hideyoshi is a hideyoshi though this is up there along with nichijou seitokai yakuindomo azumanga daioh and my all time favorite comedy golden boy
anime,not_removed,just looked up the synopsis for seto no hanayome yakuza mermaid family im sold already
anime,not_removed,thanks for the recommendation ill have to check it out
anime,not_removed,i second this grand blue is funny as hell as expected of the author of baka to test
anime,not_removed,really and i was looking forma a reason to read it thanks
anime,not_removed,id say youd get a better idea of things such as puns and references which are lost in translation if you chose to learn japanese which i think would improve your experience in general if youre already a sub fan i think it might even improve your enjoyment of shows you currently enjoy for example say theres a famous line which youve only been able to relate to through subtitled dialogue and some japanese you didnt understand being able to understand why it means what it means might make it easier to relate to also comparing the ways in which characters speak to one another and refer to themselves pronoun choice etc adds a layer of depth you generally wont see translated adequately in subtitles as for dubs personally i never watch them but in general i view them as a separate product
anime,not_removed,im learning japanese as a third language to french first and english second im around and my experience has been very positive after a lot of experience with the medium even without studying japanese you could already differentiate different tones overall feelings and sort of feel when the voice acting is worse than usual if you were worried about picking up on more bad voice acting i can assure you that the quality is pretty high significantly better than the little live action ive seen then youll pick up on more precise meanings of what is said than whats offered by english subtitles and youll identify quirks differentiate between dialects and other stuff like that which arent really translatable which is definitely fun and i have no strong opinions against dubs either i dont particularly care about watching something in its intended language as i prefer watching movies in french vfi or vfq myself as our high budget movie dubs are of great quality i find ill watch tv series in english though as far as anime go i havent really strayed from japanese dubs but i have fond memories of french dubs vff i watched as a kid and ive also compared a lot of ghibli and other movies in all languages and i tend to prefer japanese over french over english dont really have any experience with series but i wouldnt imagine it being any different
anime,not_removed,honestly my experience is that watching anime is greatly enriched by knowledge of the language you get a lot more connotation of whats being said and unless the subs are painfully bad the subs actually enhance the experience sometimes im quite inspired by a translation it really is an art more than a science after all it used to be a lot worse back in the late early you had some really awful fansubs going around but both professional and amateur translation have come a long way since then
anime,not_removed,i personally started learning the language before i started watching anime but i notice how liberal some subs are and it distracts me so i actually prefer dubs
anime,not_removed,i only know a teeny tiny bit of japanese at this point but it occasionally makes me annoyed with sufficiently poor subs
anime,not_removed,i grew up speaking both english and mandarin so im not sure if english is my second language theyre both kind of my first languages i did learn japanese later on ive never seen eng dubs but there were mandarin dubs back in my childhood and they were made pretty poorly from memory so i strayed away from dubs ever since as i knew two languages to begin with i always appreciated great translation work especially for work of art such as scripts or poetry as i was asked to translate quite frequently it is the same with japanese though i still generally rely on subs im able to pick up some translation errors or some puns or context that are lost in translation this has greatly increased my viewing experience as some shows like the monogatari series is just a pain in the ass for translators
anime,not_removed,full disclosure i live in japan and havent watched anime since coming here other than whatever is on tv when im cooking or doraemon on the occasional drinking night at home with friends that said im not going to deny it could be a somewhat useful tool to keep up listening skills i know people who like me are not major fans of anime but still watch subtitled anime to keep their listening skills up so you could learn the language and still enjoy subtitled anime
anime,not_removed,i really just dont care for dubs of anything i prefer to see the work in whatever language it was meant to be shown in but that said it really doesnt change anything knowing japanese if anything it just means i can appreciate the jp voice cast even more and i get a lot more of the jokes and references than i would otherwise not exactly a fan of dubs to put it lightly
anime,not_removed,ive already become acutely aware of layers in animation by screwing with paintnet for ten minutes try using adobe animate formerly adobe flash professional to make something cool youll learn so much more
anime,not_removed,i am not fluent but i do speak some japanese along with learning more in a few years i plan on moving to japan because thats the only way to truly become fluent i like some other people here also started learning japanese because of my love for the language before i really got into anime although i started watching before i could speak anything myself i can watch and understand about of anime without subtitles i generally just pick out words that i dont know from the subtitles its a completely different experience in a good way i pick up puns better and i understand whats going on or the implications better i can tell that i understand much more watching a sub than a nonspeaker who just has the subs to go off of since theres not a word for word translation you can do from japanese to english when you have really really bad subs it doesnt matter to me because more often than not i listen for the words rather than read it sometimes they seem like humorous add ons i have watched anime without subs or dubs and pick up a fair amount but i still like the ability to fill in the holes with subs for me learningknowing japanese is probably pretty paramount to me liking it i initially watched it because it was more immersion but found myself really liking some of the stories the one drawback is that i cannot stand dubs anymore so much lost meaning so much extra flair that the voice actors put in their voice thats normal with japanese but an english speaker would never do id rather listen to nails on a chalkboard all day than watch a single episode dubbed i dont try to vocalize my hatred of them all the time because that can be annoying but if its pertinent i will voice my opinion its so uncomfortable
anime,not_removed,weeb
anime,not_removed,english dubs are near universally cancer im not at a level yet where i could forgo subtitles or probably pick up on shoddy japanese voice acting but fucking hell are the performance just terrible in dubs i can read most anything alright but anime just goes too fast for me
anime,not_removed,ghost stories its a substandard sub but a fantastic dub the vas just made things up how do i know this one of that ghosts who happened to be a ten year old girl started extolling the virtues of the black penis
anime,not_removed,how does subtitled anime keep up your listening skills for you personally im asking because for me if im reading subs im basically not listening to whats being said i have to turn the subs off to force myself to listen and im not sure if this is a personal problem or if other people experience this as well
anime,not_removed,this was mostly textures in fallout new vegas mostly but it has completely ruined one piece for me i do enjoy graphic design however ill look into it
anime,not_removed,was easily my favorite part of the ghost stories dub
anime,not_removed,yeah usually i turn the subtitles off my friends use them though
anime,not_removed,is it cuz your black
anime,not_removed,nope im white as can be also i have pet rabbits
anime,not_removed,watch black lagoon and panty stocking
anime,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbvpwjbllivu but now that cpm and manga arent overseeing dub scripts anymore its slowly becoming a relic of the past i personally love it when i come across much older dubs that just but when its done nowadays for dramatic effect i usually just roll my eyes
anime,not_removed,my biggest problem was for example in the cowboy bebop dub with the subtitles on a lot of the swears dont match up between what is said and what is written i noticed that a lot of the time shit and damn were interchangeable between the dub and the dubs subs
anime,not_removed,add with most things it depends on how its done for example i thought the one fbomb in the accel world dub was very well placed and delivered excellently
anime,not_removed,well said black lagoon is very mature and takes itself and rightfully very seriously
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,oh true panty stocking is great i remember hearing the vas were allowed to go crazyoff book so thats probably why it feels way more natural
anime,not_removed,yes
anime,not_removed,i think that could be becausw the dialogue for adult swim was actually somewhat different for bebop adult swim used more damns less shits also ive noticed that as likes to swap out one of fayes lines every other time they air it when shes talking what hackers are usually like sometimes shell refer to them as nerds sometime as otaku which is whats on the dvd and bluray
anime,not_removed,most of the shows you listed are actioncomedy so i think gurren lagann would interest you its similar to kill la kill in the over the top action with likable characters
anime,not_removed,steins gate code geass deathnote and psycho pass
anime,not_removed,prison school
anime,not_removed,log horizon fullmetal alchemist brotherhood attack on titan since you liked kabaneri the studio for kabaneri did attack on titan
anime,not_removed,attack on titan death note steinsgate one punch man the most popular ones
anime,not_removed,steinsgate
anime,not_removed,you should make your own myanimelist account while youre at it you can keep track of what shows you have seen score them and get recommendations based on your anime its really quite useful
anime,not_removed,oh jesus so many comments so fast thank you all for the recommendations i will look into all of them
anime,not_removed,watamote
anime,not_removed,check out you seem to seem to have a similar taste in anime to me aside from haruhi id recommend anything i gave a or more
anime,not_removed,sabagebu is funny as hell
anime,not_removed,try out assassination classroom for a recent series thats fully completed
anime,not_removed,gunslinger girl
anime,not_removed,jojos bizarre adventure
anime,not_removed,ajin no game no life seven deadly sins attack on titans tokyo ghoul
anime,not_removed,dont listen to people who naysay psychopass and the movie season would have been amazing as a two cour it isnt and yes it feels rushed and cant reach the heights of but it sets the movie up nicely and has great development for akane and ginoza also introduces characters for the movie and hopefully a season also bad psychopass is still better than a lot of anime ill stand by that statement
anime,not_removed,fullmetal alchemist brotherhood i watch very similar shows to you and this one was great in the same sense as the others so give it a try
anime,not_removed,zankyou no terror made by the creator of cowboy bebop it isnt talked about much but its an underrated great
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,oreimo
anime,not_removed,i think it depends on the anime more popular anime are usually shonen so it is more likely a female comain would be more popular as well a good female main protagonist would probably be shirayuki she has her own beliefs and actual character which people like a lot and is a break from the traditional princess fairytale
anime,not_removed,depends on who you ask seems like on here theres fewer female main protagonists outside of sol romance and yuri titles which arent the big moneymakers the way attack on titan or sao are even some of the the biggest shows that women like have male characters as the lead since the yaoi fandom is so strong
anime,not_removed,i think anime should only have female characters period resolves all problems
anime,not_removed,youre asking why huge franchises have more popular characters than series with the viewership in the west the girls in the bottom shows would likely be more popular if they came from more well known shows just look at something like love live where all of the girls are hugely popular and the franchise is too
anime,not_removed,ofc iroha is the best girl after all
anime,not_removed,i think in general writing a main character is harder than writing supporting characters a majority of anime have male mcs so its easier to find an example of a well written one its harder to find that in a show with a female mc because there are few character driven anime featuring them
anime,not_removed,just how much popular ryuko in japan and west
anime,not_removed,sol
anime,not_removed,then we have people complain about male protagonist in anime
anime,not_removed,just how much popular love live in west and japan
anime,not_removed,slice of life anime like aria the animation or hanasaku iroha
anime,not_removed,love live is the biggest thing since bread in japan and while its not nearly as big over in the west its still very well known and the most popular idol show in the west
anime,not_removed,in japan
anime,not_removed,you might have more luck over at rmanga

anime,not_removed,im ment the anime bro
anime,not_removed,jesus i thought this was the persona sub please completely disregard me lol
anime,not_removed,try or
anime,not_removed,im looking for an anime thats not a romance and has action trying to find something without fanservice based on your list in the main body and on your preferred categories i would say to check out pretty art cool characters and lots of action
anime,not_removed,fatezero psycho pass kabaneri of the iron fortress all of them fit perfectly to your taste and preference
anime,not_removed,if you want a good mecha bokurano is pretty good also neon genesis evangelion if you want a delinquent comedy watch cromartie high school i recommend all of these

anime,not_removed,no problem
anime,not_removed,like sand dunes
anime,not_removed,anime news network is as trustworthy as it gets its real and the hype has been real since it was announced
anime,not_removed,do keep in mind that it might not be a season we know its a sequel for sure but that could just mean its a movie
anime,not_removed,it is not necessarily season it is just a sequel project most likely season but could be a movies short ova etc
anime,not_removed,unfortunately so a code geass sequel is going to happen and we cant stop it
anime,not_removed,is this the real life
anime,not_removed,or is it just a fantasy
anime,not_removed,there is reason to live again
anime,not_removed,any idea when it will come out not any time in right maybe
anime,not_removed,prays its not a beach episode ova
anime,not_removed,i am a little down for a movie but you never know could be an ova or something
anime,not_removed,you were born without eyes
anime,not_removed,my special eyes
anime,not_removed,thats not until haruhi season is announced

anime,not_removed,may as well kill myself now then
anime,not_removed,spice and wolf season when
anime,not_removed,trust in lain
anime,not_removed,the no game no life movie kizu part iii and maybe ill finally get to fucking see kimi no na wa
anime,not_removed,more nanoha
anime,not_removed,winter spring summer winter fall sometime
anime,not_removed,little witch academia and my hero academia season mostly crossing my fingers for jojo part later in the year though
anime,not_removed,gintama
anime,not_removed,i guess only seiren natsume and cinderella girls theater i love to be surprised you know
anime,not_removed,this season of anime doesnt seem that great imo but for me it is onihei or blue exorcist onihei judging from the manga looks like something i am interested in and well as for blur exorcist from what i remember it is going to be more faithful to the manga
anime,not_removed,sg and code geass but theyre not confirmed for nanatsu no taizai is going to be fun so theres that too getting moar monogatari is always good what makes me most excited tho is gup final chapter movies but thats theatrical release so bds for first one should be available around june unless we will get actasd again no gup in sadly
anime,not_removed,legend of the galactic heroes remake space battleship yamato season remake mobile suit gundam origin rakugo season mobile suit gundam thunderbolt season kizu part iii yoru wa mijikashi arukeyo otome fate movies flcl remake gintama
anime,not_removed,attack on titan i didnt rate season terribly strongly but ill be looking forward to the conclusion hopefully the conclusion and itll make it easier to recommend to people who havent seen anime and are looking for something action packed and accessible that isnt black lagoon violet evergarden im think this was slated for release in so ill put it here obviously we dont know that much about it yet unless youve read any of the source material but watching that pv released in may got me really excited ive just got this feeling about it i think its going to be something very special girls und panzer the final chapter id been praying for more girls und panzer material since original series finished airing and ive had that prayer answered numerous times moe girls in tanks should be one of the highlights of everyones year fatestay night heavens feel ive been wanting more fate since finishing bladeworks back in and im glad ufotable are bringing out more material i dont understand why we are getting featurelength releases over a home release im not sure why theyre doing that nonetheless im eager for it steinsgate honestly i wasnt that impressed with the film featuring kurisu as the central character so hopefully will be a stronger edition to the steinsgate franchise also more okabe is always a good thing and if nothing else itll get people to get over rezero edit forgot one sakura quest pa works has generally performed well with their original works and if pressed for comment would tie with kyoto animation or madhouse for my favourite studio with shirobako being my favourite alltime anime another workplace solcomedy from pa works will at the very least be worth watching
anime,not_removed,going by my mal kono subarashii sekai ni shukufuku wo masamunekun no revenge rewrite moon and terra saenai heroine no sodatekata ♭ possibly ill add more as things interest me
anime,not_removed,heavens feel movie ill watch sao movie but im not exactly excited about it
anime,not_removed,winter is pretty light i think ive got less than shows on my list of stuff to check out acca is the big one im excited for though after having read the first few chapters spring is going to be hell though with at least shows im interested in so far yuasa and science saru also have two releases set for now oshiyama is rumored to be working with them as well plus whatever summer and fall bring
anime,not_removed,im most excited for little witch academia
anime,not_removed,the untitled yuasa masaaki kids movie thats right the thing im most excited for doesnt have a title let alone concept art the other thing hes got upcoming is related to tatami galaxy so im not particularly interested of course sequels like are exciting too one punch man im also excited to finally be able to seen kimi no na wa and koe no katachi
anime,not_removed,from what ive seem so far mostly just sequels so gintama rakugo konosuba boku no hero little witch academia flcl etc for new shows hype usually starts after people have watched it so just gonna try to watch what i can and hopefully keep up with the popular ones
anime,not_removed,oh yes these are the anime in that i dont find people really talking about but im excited about with halfassed reasons explaining why haha i honestly hope they end fuuka with the collision of my two favorite characters yasushiro takemoto is directing this anime who also made my favorites amagi brilliant park and hyouka the synopsis sounds similar to rakugo and is being done by the studio who made rakugo so ill definitely check it out pa works the premise seems pretty interesting so why not
anime,not_removed,im mainly looking forward to the high school fleet ova sometime in
anime,not_removed,legend of the galactic heroes remake flcl remake yoru wa mijikashi arukeyo otome and rohan kishibe spinoff i dont care for the rest
anime,not_removed,if steinsgate releases in then its that if it doesnt then itll be either blue exorcist my hero academia or saiki if that releases in
anime,not_removed,little witch academia nothing else compares actually im a little looking forward to steinsgate but probably more nervous than excited
anime,not_removed,i find it funny that for some kimi no na wa is a anime
anime,not_removed,a comrade vivid strike was a nice diversion but it cant replace nanoha and fate
anime,not_removed,saenai heroine no sodatekata why have you abandoned me
anime,not_removed,same here i loved the first season hopefully the second season is better
anime,not_removed,saekano this spring you forgot that on your tally of shows we disagree on heh
anime,not_removed,ill watch sao movie but im not exactly excited about it iits not like i enjoy this series or anything baka
anime,not_removed,im reading volume of ngnl currently which is what the movie will be based on its pretty solid so far but quite different than the show i hear its really good though im hoping madhouse goes allout with the animation its gonna look spectacular
anime,not_removed,i hear its just jubril killing a bunch of elves
anime,not_removed,i dont find it very funny
anime,not_removed,what exactly is funny about that seems like normal thing for movies
anime,not_removed,muahaha eh i though the first season was pretty amusing not one of my favorites but a fun diversion nonetheless
anime,not_removed,ill be amazed when ranime confesses its dere side toward sao
anime,not_removed,im gonna have a fun diversion when i slit my wrist the moment i hear fucking akis stupid voice
anime,not_removed,he didnt bother me too much and the girls more than made up for him
anime,not_removed,hes gonna bother me even less when i faint from a bloodloss
anime,not_removed,jesus
anime,not_removed,i think it was left for us to assume that after her father saw the comet for himself that she was able to gain his support and evacuate the village in time at least thats how my brain automatically filled in the gaps i dont think it was as much of a suspense move as it was a removal of extra unneeded screen time that the audience could figure out for themselves ive noticed certain directors like to do this instead of spoon feeding the audience the whole sequence of events although i see how it could be confusing this isnt the first thread ive seen asking about the ending i could be wrong but thats how i saw it
anime,not_removed,did they purposely leave out how she saved them so we thought she actually died yes they left the major conflict off screen so they could have few minutes of you dont know the outcome
anime,not_removed,yeah that makes plenty of sense just finished watching it for a second time and it seems there were plenty of parts where there was removal of extra unneeded scenes which imo is a great thing
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,theyre completely different experiences
anime,not_removed,i dont get this question at all we cant tell you which medium you like more
anime,not_removed,i dont think that counts as anime related
anime,not_removed,visual novels
anime,not_removed,this submission has been removed the content of your post does not appear to fit httpwwwredditcomranimewikiruleswikieverythingpostedheremustbeanimespecific have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,and what is the difference
anime,not_removed,well one of them is switching to western terms a comic book and the other is a book terms not entirely accurate
anime,not_removed,instead of watching try reading berserk that is the utmost when it comes to horror violence thematics and gore
anime,not_removed,sadly horror are often a flop just because its hard to do in an anime but there are a few if you liked another maybe you would like higurashi
anime,not_removed,try shinsekai yori while not completely a horror story it definetly has some terrifying moments ghosts try as well pheraps or these last two are blind recs
anime,not_removed,yami shibai probably its the only horror anime that made me feel any fear
anime,not_removed,ive honestly never seen a successful anime horror another was okay but it never gave me that creepy scary feeling most of the time the genre horror means gruesome like corpse party however flip flappers episode was pretty fucking creepy and was probably done better than any horror anime ive ever seen
anime,not_removed,you can try this one
anime,not_removed,sorry but when you said horror i had to link this
anime,not_removed,higurashi is always my go to for horror anime check it out
anime,not_removed,if youre open to vns saya no uta is what youre looking for short wellwritten lovecraftian horror by urobuchi
anime,not_removed,if your ok with reading manga junji ito writes good horror manga otherwise there is not much in horror although the dub of ghost stories is pretty great but its not really horror
anime,not_removed,i am still trying to find good horror but an old good horror was hirasgurashi no naku koro ni or eflen lied or maybe berserkstill havent watched berserk but apparently its
anime,not_removed,cant say ive found one yet that really scared me but there are plenty of wellmade horror series you could try eg mononoke requiem from the darkness shin sekai yori has strong horror elements but isnt pure horror boogiepop phantom
anime,not_removed,for short one trying gyo maybe
anime,not_removed,i suggest bakeneko and also which came after it it has more of a traditional storytelling kind of horror feel to it if you are drawn to that kind of thing i freaking loved it but it gets pretty damn intense at times
anime,not_removed,try shiki never watched it but it kinda promising i dunno what type of horror are you trying to find
anime,not_removed,mononoke is the only thing thats ever even slightly come close to me horror in anime is subpar at best
anime,not_removed,try might not be the most scary thing but one of the most disturbing
anime,not_removed,try ghost hound or ghost hunt in my opinion the first does a much better job at being creepy rather than the latter horror is a genre that is not really done to great effect in animation
anime,not_removed,yeah anime isnt the best for horror genre at best youll get thrillers and lolli girls killing each other just because they can if you want horrorthriller and a mix of grounhog day the movie then go watch higurashi and maker sure its the original and not the kai verision
anime,not_removed,have you checked out parasyte the maxim
anime,not_removed,if you really consider another to be horror then maybe watch mayoiga
anime,not_removed,mirai nikki not a straight up horror but jeebus the gasai yuno character scared the shit out of me definitely some horror aspects but also decent scififantasymystery stuff
anime,not_removed,ive heard reading it is best very dark soulsy apparently
anime,not_removed,higurashi looks prettylighthearted from the images im seeing
anime,not_removed,its not light hearted but its not scary either its more of a mystery with gory elements
anime,not_removed,same kowabon also quite scary
anime,not_removed,elfenlied isnt really horror its not really scary at any point just gory and dark
anime,not_removed,gyo made me want to vomit more than scaring me
anime,not_removed,dark souls gets a lot of inspiration from berserk though some people call it a direct rip off rather than an homage if you liked the atmosphere in dark souls and want it but raised to the oh fuck power then i definitely recommend reading berserk
anime,not_removed,thats the fucking understatement of the year mate berserk is like taking dark souls as a person removing their blood replacing it with heroin and then giving it a broadsword thats about feet long berserk is the way to go if you want horror
anime,not_removed,the opposite in fact most of dark souls inspiration is from the series itself funny how it came to mind though read the manga itself its too good to pass up
anime,not_removed,ohhh boy no i havnt seen the season but its def not light hearted plenty of violence and suffering
anime,not_removed,oh man haha watch the first couple minutes of episode and get back to us the show takes an initially lighthearted look and setting and slowly twists it into some different horrific endstate for each arc make no mistake none of those characters are coming out of it unscathed
anime,not_removed,good just go in with that mindset
anime,not_removed,higurashi has moe spinoffs but the main series is definitely more on the horror side than another
anime,not_removed,another isnt scary either tho and since he liked that higurashi should suit his taste too
anime,not_removed,not as a horror
anime,not_removed,if i read beserk will i die a bunch of times
anime,not_removed,as in math class fuuuuuckkk
anime,not_removed,if you enjoyed the first one you really should make time to watch the second season its basically peeling back the layers of the first season and exploring the overarching mystery plus it actually brings the story to a final conclusion which seems fairly rare for these sorts of adaptations
anime,not_removed,man who cares at this point
anime,not_removed,no but the characters you care for will oh and theyll probably get raped too sometimes by demon horses
anime,not_removed,yeah i have been meaning to go rewatching it and finally finished but i just cant bring myself to rewatch i havnt been in the mood for such a heavy anime
anime,not_removed,the original lupin iii neon genesis evangelion escaflowne kon outlaw star
anime,not_removed,watch the rest of the
anime,not_removed,golden time which is by author of toradora
anime,not_removed,nichijou is a good one especially if you like slapstick and absurdist comedy
anime,not_removed,i recommend giving a go it is fastpaced over the top short has a groovy sense of style to it i also suggest maybe considering giving which is a good long running adventure series or which is a solid superhero show
anime,not_removed,finish durarara
anime,not_removed,trigun
anime,not_removed,ive watched bakemonogatari a long time ago will rewatch it and watch the rest of the series doesnt it drop in quality
anime,not_removed,from what ive seen around here most people feel is one of the best entries in the series if you mean artanimation you should try to find bd fixed versions of pretty much anything shaft they are pretty notorious for upgradingchanging a bunch of the artanimation between tv and bd releases
anime,not_removed,can confirm im watching the monogatari series for the first time and am halfway through the monogatari season easily the best one so far
anime,not_removed,check out my youtube for more otaku related videos
anime,not_removed,you know i live right by where tamako market is set i actually do my grocery shopping there ive thought of taking pictures but i dont want to look touristy as fuck so close to home
anime,not_removed,reminds me very much of the scene in welcome to the nhk
anime,not_removed,do you also spotted some yuri couple there
anime,not_removed,nice whats the name of the location
anime,not_removed,i dont really care if kumiko x reina happens if only because reina is literally chasing the d and doesnt seem all that interested in the v but if kyoani persist on baitinghinting at it i would at least like for kumiko to come out besides everyone knows the true ship is kumikoxasuka
anime,not_removed,do you know japanese or could do everything on english
anime,not_removed,i hiked up here when i went to uji last year it was a pretty awesome spot ended up feeding a bunch of birds with some locals there they would fly right on to your hand to grab the seed too
anime,not_removed,oh god ill visit this place when ever ill go to japan this place would look so beautiful in rain
anime,not_removed,if you had posted this yesterday i would have no idea what this is about
anime,not_removed,i visited here when i went to japan too the hike was surprisingly long i wanted to wait until sundown to get the perfect picture but i didnt want to make the hike down in the dark
anime,not_removed,what camera did you use o
anime,not_removed,crikey looking at this the animes attention to detail is crazy even nailed the number of planks of wood on that pedestaltable thing
anime,not_removed,visited takayama last august the hyouka vibe was so strong you could feel it i took a train from kyoto to nara passing uji on the way without realizing that was where hibiki was set maybe another time
anime,not_removed,i visited japan twice and both times i visited the shopping district that tamako market is based on both times i obviously got mochi from the local store the second time i went there was actually a nice old couple decked out with tamako market apparel and happy to greet and take pictures of me since i was travelling alone they even had a guestbook where otaku from around the world wrote and drew in and also a booklet where people left their business cards the enthusiasm of the old couple really put a smile on my face and i remember the encounter fondly not too far from the shopping district is a river with a crossing made of turtle stones which shows up in chuunibyou it was a nice place to sit down and eat my recently purchased mochi
anime,not_removed,if anyone asks your doing a project
anime,not_removed,i know this is days old but im just curious are you white i would love to go to japan but ive heard nothing but just how racist they are to foreigners you can essentially never become accepted over there
anime,not_removed,fuck i was gonna say that too
anime,not_removed,no no yuri why why must people say there is yuri in hbike it hurts me
anime,not_removed,mount daikichiyama in uji right beside kyoto the scene of hibike this was in
anime,not_removed,this exactly reina and kumiko dont need a happily ever after gay ending reina should be confused ifwhen kumiko expresses how she feels
anime,not_removed,nice prediction except the ship is not romantic love but rather sisterly love
anime,not_removed,are you referring to travelling japan without knowing japanese
anime,not_removed,went to tokyo and car tripped around hokkaido you dont need japanese much in either most service people have enough english to get by or pictures on the menus you can use and even if you do have japanese everytime i asked them to repeat somethingin japanese they would immediately switch to english friend went to kyoto on his own and he had no issues with just englishhe didnt speak any japanese at all you can get by with wifi from starbucks but id recommend you rent a phone from the airport that has internet and thatll do you for anytime you get stuck if you have the money shell out for a night in a ryoukan where ever you go and trip to the onsenlook up etiquette rules before you go to an onsen though to avoid getting thrown out we did one night in a ryoukan with an open air onsen and it was worth the money to just relax naked in a hot spring under the stars and there was an amazing course meal included in the price its nice if you have some japanese for saying hi and i want this and stuff but if your japanese isnt dont worry too much the people are in general happy to do their best to help and can speak some english
anime,not_removed,japan is definitely not that english friendly most of the stations have signs in english tho so you can get by but yes its nothing like europe where everyone speaks english that being said have been there and did get by without too much trouble lots of hand gestures tho
anime,not_removed,i was staying with a buddy i went to highschool with hes full blooded japanese and he was my walking translator
anime,not_removed,i used a top of the line galaxy active albeit i cheated and put it in pro mode so i could tinker with white balance and shit like that
anime,not_removed,i havent been by the turtles but i know a lot of people like to hang out and drink there im told that tatami galaxy is also set about a kilometer or so west of me as well
anime,not_removed,how is fresh local mochi the only time ive ever had it was in a fancy restaurant once and it was weird as hell
anime,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomillegalcolorlesscattle
anime,not_removed,i am though i havent experienced any racism or at least none that i was aware of people do talk about me fairly often thinking that i dont understand them but they usually just talk about how tall i am or about my hair or beard both bright red that said younger children usually stare me down with this kind of holy shit what is he ive never seen someone that looks like that kind of expression even some of the older kids give me a holy crap a white guy look as for the whole being accepted thing it kind of depends what you mean by accepted if you mean being accepted as japanese then no probably not even if youre perfectly fluent in the language and knowfollow all of the cultural norms that are expected of you youre still going to be carrying around your own cultures way of thinking and thats going to influence you in everything you do japan is a really homogeneous society most of the people are ethnically japanese and were born and raised here as a result anyone who isnt ethnically japanese especially if you arent asian and anyone who does anything that goes against the norms is going to stick out like a sore thumb that said its not as if they wont accept you at all in my experience people here are pretty welcoming the closest ive come to anything you might call racism is people assuming that i dont speak japanese and trying to communicate in english whether theyre good at it or not honestly though id say thats a pretty fair assumption to make a lot of foreigners here dont speak japanese and many who do dont speak it well even in my case while i can read and write fairly well i havent had a lot of practice having conversations in japanese until now id say thats more an attempt at being accommodating than anything though once they realize you understand japanese most people treat you like they would anyone else
anime,not_removed,such a amazing series and such a fun scene i guess this is the top of a hill so there wont be a little house on a hill behind it
anime,not_removed,what how can you say theres no yuri in hibike yuriphonium its even in the name
anime,not_removed,did you at least get some coffee undertones
anime,not_removed,because kyoani loves their yuribait
anime,not_removed,in my heart i wonder if there is a smaller mount shokichiyama somewhere
anime,not_removed,the more i watch this the more convincing the yuribait is i actually didnt fall for it the first time around but this is yuri as fuck by kyoani standards kumiko and reina display more mutual affection than tomoya and nagisa and they had a kid

anime,not_removed,yes i have plans to go in the future years and i fear i will not know japanese very well
anime,not_removed,im here right now traveling for fun so far i have only used google translate a couple times and i dont know any japanese if you have any questions feel free to pm me
anime,not_removed,thx nice recommendation
anime,not_removed,ill keep in mind thx
anime,not_removed,that makes it easier
anime,not_removed,well this just helped me choose my next phone thanks
anime,not_removed,the local stuff is definitely tasty though if you didnt like the texture at the restaurant you probably wont like it fresh either mochi is more of a snackdessert in my opinion and it doesnt seem right to eat it with a meal at a restaurant there is a also clear difference between the fresh stuff and the ones you can buy at the conbini the difference grows even larger as time passes because mochi definitely goes bad over time mochi also doesnt like heat too much so keep it cool if you want it to retain its flavour
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,i went to japan at the beginning of and had next to no knowledge of speaking japanese and i was fine most people you come across will not speak more than a single word or phrase of english but its easy to get by with simple gestures and probably learn a phrase or
anime,not_removed,i went to japan just last may and there was a great deal of internationalization done for the benefit of the summit and barack obama visiting at the time signs and posters were written with english translations and the good stuff too none of that engrish crap and train stations all had their names romanized underneath i speak japanese but my travel party they got along fine with english a far cry from years prior japan has made a great deal of effort to update its hospitality to accommodate english speaking foreigners just be sure to ask direction at the local mcd or lawson rather than the man on the street in kanazawa that guy is sketchy as hell i also visited uji the place op went to didnt climb the hill tho only visited the kyoani shop and bought loot was traveling with normies and could not let my weeaboo nature show too much
anime,not_removed,to be honest you dont really need to know japanese as long as you stay in tourist spots big cities youll be fine there will be signs in english there and more than likely more than one person will be able to speak english unless you want to go to some local place even then i reckon you could get pass with an skill in japanese
anime,not_removed,i think you responded to the wrong person p
anime,not_removed,the mochi was dessert not part of a dish and thanks for sharing i have no idea how old it was but it was definitely served cold its such a strange food
anime,not_removed,no no i think you are right i missed the exclamation mark in hibike adoi
anime,not_removed,most people know english they teach it in schools but they are extremely uncomfortable speaking it for this reason alone im learning japanese just to prevent people from being uncomfortable when i go to japan next summer
anime,not_removed,nice anything unusual on your trip
anime,not_removed,good to know i will try my best to learn i went to china not knowing a single chinese wordsign but we were a group and had a translator i know a few tricks too d
anime,not_removed,i think its the same in every country where english isnt the main language if someone comes to me talking english i would be uncomfortable too even if im decent
anime,not_removed,its only been compulsory for like years hasnt it the majority of the population is older than a schoolkid i imagine most of them know tidbits and maybe a few phrases but i think its unrealistic to believe most japanese people know english
anime,not_removed,ya see while i know its compulsory my experience is that not many people spoke it although they seemed willing to try to understand me they really couldnt
anime,not_removed,if you term unusual as extraordinary climbed to the top of the hill at fushimiinari taisha cycled the shimanami ocean road bicycle trail visited yuwaku onsen they modeled hanasaku irohas onsen off of this place if unexpected because barack obama was in hiroshima the added security measures made the trains late by minutes the conductor was announcing an apology every minutes for the delay you could hear the tears of shame thanks obama
anime,not_removed,luckily you can get by with hand signals and a basic knowledge of their numbers our special trick when i went was pointing at a dish and sayin something like kore hitotsufutatsu kudasai with a smile ikura desu ka to ask for the price and to always gain attention with sumimasen leave with an arigatou gozaimasu and a bow the people there are extreeemely polite and tolerating too xd
anime,not_removed,nothing gets past these eagle eyes
anime,not_removed,probably yes i think its worse in countries that dont use the roman alphabet though grammar is usually a lot different and giving a sound to certain parts of the word is something the japanese dont use the ou in doumo and the ou in arigatou is the same sound while western people make them sound different side note i prefer people talking to me in english i hate my own language and think its stupid
anime,not_removed,english education in japanese compulsory education has been around for over a century many classes in the better universities and naval colleges were taught at least partially in english before of course both the quality and quantity of this education has improved in the postwar period while the actual amount of english taught has been increasing since a few decades ago most japanese people cant really speak english apart from a few phrases and this can be attributed to the fact that english is not seen as a necessity in ones daily life its true that teens generally have a better command of the language than older people but this isnt because they didnt have english education until a decade or two ago but because they have not had the time to forget their education and because their pride doesnt get in their way of using an unfamiliar language and potentially being embarrassed at least thats my observation as someone who lives in the country
anime,not_removed,the one teaching me japanese told me that guess thats logical what you said
anime,not_removed,this makes a lot of sense my time in japan was filled with very little english comprehension
anime,not_removed,cool everyone see something different d
anime,not_removed,nice ones thx
anime,not_removed,wait you mean japanese or are you from somewhere else
anime,not_removed,that all sounds about right to me but i was completely unaware english had been taught as a compulsory subject for such a long time in japan
anime,not_removed,yeah youre right for sure though i completely understand them being uncomfortable speaking it to a native how long have you been learning japanese by the way im currently second semester d
anime,not_removed,im from elsewhere everything mentiones is from outside information that may or may not be true
anime,not_removed,a couple weeks im using the human japanese app to help me with that the app starts with teaching you hiragana then proceeds to teach words and grammar a bit at a time and slowly introducing katakana would you mind if i contact you once in a while i would need a partner to practice my japanese speaking and a fellow learner would seem perfect
anime,not_removed,yeah go for it
anime,not_removed,as a backer im excited as all hell to see how this turned out
anime,not_removed,holy shit its actually happening im gonna feel bad watching it without backing it
anime,not_removed,for anyone who missed itwants to copy and paste it is the year japan is at the center of an international conflict over what has come to be known as light of humanity as a result un forces have been deployed in japan as peacekeepers among them is an assassination unit consisting solely of teenagers they are called flowers because they always end up dead like flowers in full bloom that fall in the wind
anime,not_removed,the funny thing is that ranime mods gave them a middle finger and took down posts to their kickstarted and openly admitted they wont be promoting it while supporting crunchyroll hulu etc so much for supporting the anime industry lmao
anime,not_removed,months late
anime,not_removed,yuzuke kozaki til i know im being super outdated on this one but looking at his name is good enough to convince me to watch it when its available legally
anime,not_removed,they confirmed they had found investors to do a full series right it was posted some time ago but havent heard anything since then
anime,not_removed,its weird to think that like years ago or so i dropped to get a bluray of this at some point eventually and now its finally going to happen
anime,not_removed,fyi its just one single episode not a series
anime,not_removed,will watch but have low expectations of this the kickstarter campaign had as much insane drama as mighty no did and this ova has been delayed twice just like mighty no i wont forget how hiroaki yura had to post that video from his bedroom looking burnt out on how he and his company were thrown out of the project by kinema citrus and by jiro ishii if that insider leak on reddit was true on practically a whim
anime,not_removed,it dont look as good as it initially didand where is the real mc in this did they change the blonde i really hope not
anime,not_removed,k i c k s t a r t e r d r e a m s i c k s t a r t e r d r e a m s
anime,not_removed,looks shittier than expected and doesnt seem to compare to the kickstarter trailer i hope im wrong though
anime,not_removed,wait so this realy is new mc i realy liked old mc design i hope old stuff from teasers is still in the ova
anime,not_removed,something tells me this is gonna be shit just like kabaneri
anime,not_removed,me too me too me too
anime,not_removed,you can still buy merch off their website if you want to help support it shirt figurine poster soundtrack etc
anime,not_removed,why does it always have to be a teenager i love the art style and the animation i really hope that it isnt like some harem and more like evangelion
anime,not_removed,details i never saw that
anime,not_removed,details i never saw that
anime,not_removed,was excited for a second
anime,not_removed,thats not anthea theyve been using her as a mascot since the beginning theres no way theyre changing her design thats one of the other members
anime,not_removed,idk if its changed since their ks launched but despite their focus on anthea in marketing materials hana is the mc of episode hana tougetsu number op support hana is the main character of episode although not remarkably skilled in combat her stereotypical japanese high schooler exterior belies her unique gift to shift peoples moods and mental states using her talent she often gives much needed stability and catharsis to the team helping shield them from their tremendous burdens an all around nice girl with strong family ties she lives with her family and brother
anime,not_removed,that would be incredible considering mashiro ando has yet to direct anything that could be close to considered shit
anime,not_removed,cultural fascination with youth i guess its like that with movies and shows here too growing old sucks
anime,not_removed,because teenagers are disposable i guess
anime,not_removed,im willing to give them the benefit of the doubt since year olds can join the army in some developed countries like us and uk its possible if they set up the conflict right for age minimums to be slightly lowered since this is apparently one where un peacekeepers have to intervene once i see the crew of this teenled assassination squad then ill make my judgement on whether its used for marketingexploitative purposes or if itll fit well with the story or both i suppose edit not for us sorry although it looks like it year olds can apparently join in uk
anime,not_removed,thank god haruhi
anime,not_removed,holy shit he directed akagami no shirayuki ilovethiskindofshit
anime,not_removed,canaan says hi
anime,not_removed,well people said that teenagers were in anime to kind of sell more copies but this isnt the case here it was a kickstarter also wasnt this supposed to be made for the west so youd expect something like gits cowboy bebop trigun and etc i dont want to say this but i think a lot of people will be disappointed
anime,not_removed,maybe because they dont have the right to rule their own lives yet and the agency is the guardian taking care of them if theyre orphaned youths
anime,not_removed,i read a book series called cherub when i was younger quite a good way of making teenagers into government spies in a way that makes sense
anime,not_removed,you cant join the military in the us until unless you lie to the recruiter but thats next to impossible nowadays with everything computerized
anime,not_removed,i hope the backers read what was in their kickstarter page as a cover the international school for boys and girls was established for the ongoing covert operation of discovering and recruiting gifted high school students each with their own special abilities and to coerce them in the service of an elite death squad
anime,not_removed,anime in general have a trend of using teenagers as the main characthers maybe its because the main audience for these shows are teenagersyoung adults
anime,not_removed,oh i made a mistake but looking at it again isnt it actually with parental consent
anime,not_removed,yeah i was trying to give an inuniverse reason for it though
anime,not_removed,guess youre right it is indeed with parental consent for all branches the sole exception is the navy reserve where you have to be to join them no loopholes there
anime,not_removed,mpchc and klite codec pack maybe
anime,not_removed,i use barebones mpchc no complaints
anime,not_removed,didnt we just have a thread about this the other day anyway this type of question is probably better off in ftf or no stupid questions try to keep direct questions that are only tangentially related to anime in those places in the future also why not vlc ive been using it forever and have had zero issues
anime,not_removed,klite codec pack never heard about this one gonna check how it compares to kcp thanks
anime,not_removed,not really issues regarding bugsvideo playetc its just video quality i did some blind comparisons using the same flac files and mpchc kcp did a better job than vlc
anime,not_removed,nice try botchan
anime,not_removed,huhweird i thought it was a standard popular codec pack i never have problems while reproducing anime files or movies you welcome
anime,not_removed,oh well thats not something that would be significant to me anyway i use a retina screen with a weird resolution so basically everything is upscaled to some extent p
anime,not_removed,flip flappers
anime,not_removed,konosuba gabriel dropout maid dragon new game
anime,not_removed,why do you only want anime from the last years if you like anime it shouldnt matter when it came out
anime,not_removed,ive watched most of the good stuff from before then
anime,not_removed,nhk felt like it came from such an honest place i really loved it as well hurts though when you start drawing way too many comparisons shit made me get a job to help my mom pay rent and not feel like a college parasite lol unfortunately i havent come across any other anime like it
anime,not_removed,there is basically no show similar to it but you can check the recommendations tab in the mal page of the anime to see anime which share some characteristics
anime,not_removed,watch aku no hana it has a similiar theme but is much darker really great show if you are ok with a more exotic artstyle which fits the anime imo
anime,not_removed,any chance of reading the manga characters are more despicable and you learn more about misaki then youd want to
anime,not_removed,its a very insightful take of lives of shutin and how he progressed to that stage and thinks another that is pretty similar would be watamote from a female perspective though its more focused on humor than a progressive story
anime,not_removed,for whatever reason this question made pop into my head so give that one a looksee
anime,not_removed,if the black comedy is what youre looking for theres watamote however as other have said welcome to the nhk is super unique
anime,not_removed,try oregairu it isnt a very similar show but apparently they have crossover appeal
anime,not_removed,its funny i was actually planning to rewatch it in the next couple of weeks welcome to the nhk is my favorite anime with themes that resonate with me on a very personal level and ive been looking for a similar one since i watched it sadly i still havent found anything quite like it that said if you havent already and you need more nhk you should read the novel andor the manga i havent read the novel yet but the manga is worth reading it adapts some things differently and has a different ending it goes further in time iirc
anime,not_removed,i would recommend watamote i saw it in the recommendation for nhk after watching and loving it and went into it blind the humour is more cringe than black but its still humour about someone maladapted to real life also read the manga its a lot darker and more comedic although i preferred the anime ending
anime,not_removed,maybe death parade
anime,not_removed,on episode now and its been an amazing ride so far i cant wait to see how it ends but i know a part of me will be sad when it does i have a feeling this anime will end up in my top
anime,not_removed,anohana is a great one if you like the feels nhk is one of my favorites only surpassed by clannad i think you should give it a try again later
anime,not_removed,id check steinsgate out closest thing out there but yet not really similar steinsgate and nhk are my top shows though
anime,not_removed,mind games is an anime film that is rather similar
anime,not_removed,well i found angel beats to have some of this drama yes the initial episodes are mostly of actioncomedy however in the rest it really puts on the feels and you actually feel for the characters and what they have gone through
anime,not_removed,sinead oconnor nothing compares to you its one of the grates because nothing else is like it
anime,not_removed,man your missing out on not finishing clannad or ylia probly the best romance anime out there but if your not into romance i can understand
anime,not_removed,if manga is okay with you i recommend reading oyasumi punpun also watch aku no hana like someone else mentioned
anime,not_removed,ranime college parasytes
anime,not_removed,nhk was like looking into a mirror of myself it was the first time in my life that i have experienced that feeling like someone understood me it did turn my life around for a year or so but now im back to being a hikineet feelsbadman
anime,not_removed,yea i figured as much that is the main reason i liked it so much is it was unlike any anime ive seen before i think that is why i enjoyed it so much
anime,not_removed,i second this i loved that said the anime is still an incomplete adaptation but i hope well get a second season someday and youll have to read the manga if you want to finish the story be warned though that the manga and the anime have wildly different art styles and a lot of people seem to hate the anime because of this personally i thought it was a great adaptation
anime,not_removed,i thought the rotoscoping was a fantastic way to really push the sense of unease that the entire story revolved around its unfortunate that a lot of people wrote it off early on for having a really thematically fitting art style instead of just the generic moeblob character design that sells
anime,not_removed,could u spoil what u r talking about please
anime,not_removed,thanks ill see if i like it
anime,not_removed,yeah im definitely sad after finishing it therein lies the reason i want to divert my attention to another series right away lol
anime,not_removed,i second anohana my second favorite drama anime fourth favorite altogether after nhk my second favorite altogether
anime,not_removed,yeah i have already seen steinsgate and it is my number one show after i finished both of these shows i was left with the same feeling as if i had just watched something very important or meaningful
anime,not_removed,ahh i watched angel beats about months ago and it was also a show that a really enjoyed while i did have some complaints about it mostly it feeling too short but it was still great
anime,not_removed,okay whats your reason for not likeing it
anime,not_removed,tatami galaxy is good but zetsubou is nowhere near the perfection of nhk
anime,not_removed,thank you both look interesting i will give them a shot
anime,not_removed,zetsu gets boring pretty fast
anime,not_removed,nuhuh im an employed parasyte
anime,not_removed,as someone who loves nhk i can give you some reccomendations i reccomend the tatami galaxy whose similarity to nhk wont become apparent til the end if you want a similar feeling but more optimisticcheerful story with relatable characters but with more focus on romance i recommend the molester man manga dont let the title scare you and finally i reccomend oyasumi punpun if you dont want optimism and want far deeper human tragedy be warned the story is gets incredibly bleak
anime,not_removed,i third aku no hana it was amazing and i came here to recommend it though i still need to get around to reading the manga
anime,not_removed,an adaption of the second arc would be awesome the third arc wasnt that exciting imo the artstyle of the manga is pretty generic
anime,not_removed,yeah i think the rotoscoping actually made it better it kind of makes you feel uncomfortable because it feels uncanny it really is a shame the story is brilliant but most people wont even look at it
anime,not_removed,i cant say they are terribly alike but have you tried beck its worth a watch or two for sure
anime,not_removed,have you seen the alternative ending
anime,not_removed,ive seen higher amounts of perfection than nhk watching children play as for zetsubou the recommendation isnt as much about quality as it is about loads of black comedy black comedy or dramatic type shows
anime,not_removed,well he does have haruhi as a and as a so i think hes a little insane
anime,not_removed,this is the rudest ive ever seen this subreddit be usually this is a friendly place for anime discussion not year olds trying to be edgy and failing
anime,not_removed,glad to help even if i get downvoted for taking the potshot at nhk p
anime,not_removed,get to reading the manga it gets even more intense in the later arcs
anime,not_removed,no but ive heard good things i just have to commit to starting it
anime,not_removed,i wouldnt even say zetsubou is either of those to be honest its not even close to similar to nhk in my opinion its more of a parody
anime,not_removed,but but hero academia anime just finished so i want to read that
anime,not_removed,genres comedy parody school yes it is parody and correct its not similar to nhk in drama or plot but i dont see how you could possibly say it doesnt feature black comedy among many other moments its a running gag for s mc to want to kill himself almost die because of someone else and exclaim what if i had died also not that it matters but zetsubou is the most recommended show from nhk on mal so some people clearly must think if you like one you might like the other
anime,not_removed,it looked like weak bait to me just came out the gates trash talking a generally well received show and then boldly claims somes shows better all this with no explanation why he thinks a show is trash nor why the other shows are better i mean if that is not low leveled bait then that is just an unintentional low quality post either way both are downvote worthy in my opinion
anime,not_removed,not because he expressed his opinion thats over simplifying things he was just being snarky and throwing insults without any reasoning behind it its one thing to dislike an anime and express your opinion about it but its another thing to trash on it with jokes and links on a post commending the show
anime,not_removed,eh i dont mind op at least saw my genuine recommendations before i got downvoted to the point of autohidden after that i have enough internet points to spare
anime,not_removed,i dont really consider ironic suicidal jokes to be black comedy thats just me though i guess i took op as wanting a show with actual depth and thought provoking themes not just ironic edgy comedy and yes all viewers that recommended it brought it to its deserving place spot
anime,not_removed,still cant get over just how worn out kazuma looks happy to see ryuho is still quite the bro once he got his memories back and sheris in the past looked quite wild i liked it
anime,not_removed,screenwriter guy just cant win ryuho got back his memory and notsonice personality but looks like he left holy so thats interesting now i really wanna see him and kazuma meet to see what happens
anime,not_removed,sheris in the past looked quite wild i know right i wouldnt mind seeing more of her past just to see her like that again she hasnt been that fleshed out yet so maybe thatll happen

anime,not_removed,after finishing kiznaiver last night i want to punch all those stupid motherfuckers in the face
anime,not_removed,the mc from welcome to nhk he annoyed me to no end
anime,not_removed,every tsundere thats going overboard to hide hisher feelings
anime,not_removed,suzaku from code geass hes by far my most hated character
anime,not_removed,uhh onodera ha ha ha haahahahahahahahahaha
anime,not_removed,blair from soul eater she was probably the first time i truly saw a fanservice character in a show shes so useless and uneeded that i honestly fell a bit dissapointed she wasnt much better in the manga either i love the show but god do i hate her edit seriously why am i downvoted
anime,not_removed,god i hate that
anime,not_removed,how dare he try and take
anime,not_removed,amarti the only japanese cartoon character that has managed to elicit murderous rage from almost the entire audience of the show he features in
anime,not_removed,bitch if you so much as look at this wolf deity ill curb stomp your ass
anime,not_removed,it makes me so damn happy that this is top comment
anime,not_removed,isnt that what happened to him in via chitoge and haru anyways
anime,not_removed,unfortunately physical attacks dont work on ghost types so i guess the only one left now is tada banri himself might as well get a liitle help from saitama too if im still not satisfied with my punches
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcommnwhdtggif
anime,not_removed,best girl
anime,not_removed,ugh a punch isnt enough
anime,not_removed,what she was best girl
anime,not_removed,rfuckjusticebitch
anime,not_removed,ooh where is that from
anime,not_removed,justicebitch ftfy
anime,not_removed,omg that little oh god i hated her so much kidna ruined the show for me and made me drop it
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,triggered
anime,not_removed,i love that scene so much
anime,not_removed,at of hxh and i just cant stand how shit of a dad can this guy be and still think he is awesome anyway the spoiler you said was a joy to watch
anime,not_removed,suzaku for me he was just so damn hypocritical
anime,not_removed,fucking nina poor tablekun will never be the same
anime,not_removed,i felt this way about shirley tbh
anime,not_removed,fucking yoshio hes the definition of a mumbling idiot and if thats not enough hes also a fucking scumbag
anime,not_removed,came here to say the male mc from white album s i acknowledge that the situation was complex and difficult for anyone to navigate but it took everything not to yell at the screen with him making all the wrongbrash decisions in regards to how he treated the other two went about things not on boarding a specific ship which is a different discussion
anime,not_removed,his intention is not wrong at all just the way he explains and does things for its is completely misunderstanding and wrong
anime,not_removed,you mean white album
anime,not_removed,this had me literally screaming at the screen fucking turd
anime,not_removed,kinda looks like the protagonist from mob psycho
anime,not_removed,the very same masao is pretty obvious but god fucking dammit that monk is the most annoying shit ever and i wish he would just die
anime,not_removed,why the monk specifically i can easily understand masao but the monk was cool
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,so many tanukisso little sense
anime,not_removed,hori for me damn violent tsundere messing up the funny
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,mfw somebodys not bashing danzo etotamadunno anyway yeah obitos totally the coolest guy
anime,not_removed,also in naruto as well when sasuke told naruto he didnt know how sasuke felt since he never had parents like what the fuck man
anime,not_removed,s lancer smashing him in the face was too good
anime,not_removed,i hate him but for different reasons anyone thats read hf would know
anime,not_removed,hen na hanashi
anime,not_removed,i think most of us can tolerate the stereotypical high pitched female anime cutesy voice but damn brick nuggets floras voice is almost equivalent to scratching nails on blackboard noise
anime,not_removed,s dude works so well as a villain because of that people often say he wasnt that great but hes really not a complex villain hes a troll he exists solely to make the lives of others harder doesnt make him any less punchable just saying that him being punchable means he was made well
anime,not_removed,but dios face would look good on anything
anime,not_removed,oh yeah fuck characters like that
anime,not_removed,what anime
anime,not_removed,yeah for a story thats largely about microeconomics they did a damn good job making a singular villain sort of character he isnt even all that unlikable in a grand scheme of things hes just getting in the way of some of our most beloved characters
anime,not_removed,youd think watching so many subtitled shows would do something for reading comprehension
anime,not_removed,i suppose it was a strangely worded question so whatevers fun is fine imo
anime,not_removed,i felt like punching everyone in seed by the end of it
anime,not_removed,i hated seed in general
anime,not_removed,youll miss because he has main character plot armor you could probably shoot him and he wouldnt die
anime,not_removed,he looks a lot like yoshio from kuma miko ironically that guy is punchable both inuniverse and out
anime,not_removed,but the man sure loves his eggs
anime,not_removed,it not difficult to want to punch the u of reddit
anime,not_removed,come on man even the adorable little fuzzball at the end
anime,not_removed,honestly i think people give kyousuke too much shit for this does no one remember that s while they were dating kuroneko moved halfway across the city with telling him if it wasnt for kirino he wouldve never found out what happened kuronekos my favorite but i cant blame kyousuke for not picking her after she pulled that
anime,not_removed,you beat me to it by three minutes
anime,not_removed,yeah people always defend him but i still cant get over that he s set up simon with that fake trial to be fucking executed there was no reason to go that far
anime,not_removed,dagnabbit i came here to post this thinking i was so clever i agree though lets see him grit those teeth
anime,not_removed,odd i found him to be one of the most realistic and detailed characters
anime,not_removed,this is for characters you want to punch in the face not characters who you want to shove in a wood chipper
anime,not_removed,seriously she was the biggest cockblock in all anime
anime,not_removed,which one
anime,not_removed,get in the robot biotch gendo bitchslap to the face
anime,not_removed,burn off his eyebrows whilst youre at it
anime,not_removed,well at least he has something to back it up shirou on the other hand
anime,not_removed,i really hope he gets better i dont think i can sit through anything worse
anime,not_removed,everyone from school days but yes
anime,not_removed,did you watch deens fatestay night first and then the ubw anime
anime,not_removed,yup thats kind of the point fate shows us the character and his flawed ideals ubw shows us his attempting to temper them into something that works while staying true to who he is and hfwell ill save that for when it comes out
anime,not_removed,dont worry i do get how you feel and yes i as well understood his flawed character which made him interesting for me and dissolved all the hatred i had for him
anime,not_removed,really i though his character in ubw was even worse i liked him in hf alot though
anime,not_removed,he was such a karma houdini in that episode
anime,not_removed,obeyron pls
anime,not_removed,if at times is all the time i suppose
anime,not_removed,fyi in the spoiler you forgot to put quotes around the actual spoiler otherwise they turn up as links
anime,not_removed,well episode did make me drop the show so i guess ill agree though from what i hear it saved me from even worse loli fanservice later on
anime,not_removed,dio definitely wins the award for the character that most deserves a thousand kicks to the crotch in my books
anime,not_removed,kouko really if anyone deserves to be punched in that show id say its s ghost banri
anime,not_removed,gamu oniichan gamu
anime,not_removed,its not his fault hes a pussy magnet
anime,not_removed,in the sort of extended universe of games hes not even half the bastard that httpiimgurcomfsrlphjjpg it kind of runs in the family
anime,not_removed,i thought you meant schoollive at first and i was very confused
anime,not_removed,clementine from overlord oh come on she just needs a little conversation and a hug and shes not that bad life just broke her a little
anime,not_removed,dont you make fun of her
anime,not_removed,youre making fun of her
anime,not_removed,hououinseesit
anime,not_removed,id rather punch fb if im honest
anime,not_removed,when he went full retard in the last ep tho
anime,not_removed,idk trinity mc is amazing hahaha
anime,not_removed,nope he isnt like shirou because subaru acts like a retard and gets appropriate results gets shit on but shirou however
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,why emilia though
anime,not_removed,its orange thank you very much
anime,not_removed,honestly i couldnt stand sonozaki her dialogue was so vague and emotionless at least nico was fun and got to the point
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,be careful if you punch yuki in the face s hell just shoot you just like he shot his friends yuki is by far my least favorite character in fiction

anime,not_removed,waver and rider grandpa were the absolute best part of zero looking back on it waver definitely got the most character development
anime,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but wasnt s holo sorta leading him on as part of her plan granted amarti didnt need to be such an asshole throughout the situation though
anime,not_removed,what show is this from
anime,not_removed,nice tags
anime,not_removed,without half the fanbase eventually getting ironic boners for the characters notcrimes coughcoughgriffithhackcoughdiohack
anime,not_removed,good taste
anime,not_removed,well if youre a normal type he cant hit you either
anime,not_removed,the obvious answer is sucker punch which would be super effective
anime,not_removed,was s until she became crazy and until chelsea appeared
anime,not_removed,akame ga kill
anime,not_removed,im pretty sure the tables just want a support group for that one
anime,not_removed,i was just annoyed that they never addressed her racism
anime,not_removed,i cant mention the words nina or einstein to my tables now as they have ptsd
anime,not_removed,suzaku be like s ill call you deplorable for doing things and then do those same things but because im working with the social darwinist empire im the good guy
anime,not_removed,suzaku is a dumbass but its still nothing compared to the level of hatred i have towards nina
anime,not_removed,but the thing is it wouldnt have had to end up so complicated s setsuna had given touma a fair chance she tried to go over her head despite knowing that touma loved him if setsuna had told the mc that she and touma loved him would he have still chosen setsuna
anime,not_removed,they totally wanted to induce a grey moralty aspect with him but his train of thought was so blatantly off that i couldnt feel anything more than rage when he appeared the graphic violence did a better job portraying the there are no good guys here idea than any of the monks pseudophilosophical rambles did
anime,not_removed,what he was best guy
anime,not_removed,danzo had good intentions just bad executions obito was literally triggered by this grills death to do all the shit he does in the story
anime,not_removed,well hes just speaking from the heart is it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved before sasuke clearly thinks not yeah its an insensitive thing to say but after beating on each other i think they were well past that point
anime,not_removed,best bro indeed
anime,not_removed,my hatred for shinji went to another level when i found out that he s had been abusing and raping sakura for years what an irredeemable piece of shit
anime,not_removed,which made that one scene at the end so much more satisfying
anime,not_removed,maybe you wanted to say that scratching nails on blackboard is almost equivalent to floras voice
anime,not_removed,outbreak company
anime,not_removed,agreed hes not a badly written character by any means but he had the audacity to perturb the lawrence x holo ship unforgivable
anime,not_removed,well microeconmics is a little broad its more about shorting products
anime,not_removed,s as confirmed by slain
anime,not_removed,hes a pretty well written quality character its what he did that is fucking despicable and also the reason why he deserves to be punched
anime,not_removed,yeah but hes being realistic in a world where s you can make your giant robot transform through sheer force of will i dont think normal rules apply to his world
anime,not_removed,im honestly surprised at the amount of vitriol hes been garnering lately like yes he was cringy as fuck last episode but i just felt pity for the dude rather than any actual hatred
anime,not_removed,shoving him into a wood chipper would probably be doing him a favor s after last episode
anime,not_removed,¿por qué no los dos
anime,not_removed,shirou on the other hand s stood with saber side by side and beat gilgamesh s both gil and herioc spirit emiya and won both times while succeeding in his goal of saving everyone he wanted to save s an upgraded even nastier than normal berserker then saber alter saved sakura and destroyed the grail all on his own take your pick
anime,not_removed,i get the feeling he cant sink any lower so the only way to go is up right right
anime,not_removed,kotonoha seems okay
anime,not_removed,the girls can be salvaged though i mean makoto was the one who made them into retards or maybe the plot itself lol
anime,not_removed,close i watched deen the ubw movie seriously wish i hadnt fatezero and then finally the ubw anime
anime,not_removed,soz
anime,not_removed,at least people arent getting spoiled for no reason
anime,not_removed,if not dio though then shiro from assassination classroom come let tentacles overrun your psychi ruining people lives since
anime,not_removed,it is his fault that hes a piece of shit
anime,not_removed,never go full retard
anime,not_removed,how so shirou wins in every route and gets all the girls
anime,not_removed,emilia her speech was laughable and she was a real bitch when she spoke with subaru
anime,not_removed,i also dont know how she would be considered a loli
anime,not_removed,drooped the series because of him but if its for yuno i will watch out then xd loved yuno to bad i couldnt stand yukiteru
anime,not_removed,i stand corrected
anime,not_removed,im still not particularly sure why amarti is hated with such passion he had his good intentions
anime,not_removed,yes it was season
anime,not_removed,spice wolf
anime,not_removed,holo from spice and wolf
anime,not_removed,its not great taste its the truth
anime,not_removed,not unless it used a different type of move like ice fire or thunder punch which is learned through breeding
anime,not_removed,heres a little trivia for you sucker punch is not really a punching move thats why some pokemon with no arms can learn this move as far as i can remember it was a surprise attack or like a sneak attack or something but it sure is super effective against ghost types
anime,not_removed,youre saying that like its a bad thing
anime,not_removed,ah yes thank you
anime,not_removed,that would be hard to say i do not believe it was so simple s can you really expect setsuna to confess her love for herself and touma would anybody be able to do that touma also had many chances and even kissed him while he was sleeping right before that which triggered setsuna to act for wrong or right all that aside it was more the later episodes when he realized his feelings and just did so many things without thinking how it would effect the other such as getting it on with touma while skipping out on setsunas birthday by claiming to be sick there were just better ways to go about the situation not claiming i would make the right decision in realtime but it was frustrating to watch in the end the complicated stuff did happen and he reacted as such
anime,not_removed,a violent tsundere cannot be a best anything as long as the violence in question is not well deserved which in this case it is not there needs to be an anime where violent tsunderes are paired up so that they only beat the crap out of each other and not the innocent edit well i guess fairy tail counts though thats more rivalry matches than attempts to hurt maybe
anime,not_removed,the problem is that hes just speaking from the heart it shows how much of a fucking piece of shit sasuke is who even thinks that shit
anime,not_removed,seriously though what i hate even more about that is s part of me couldnt help but feel like all of that was written in just to give sakura a tragic backstory and to make shinji and irredeemable piece of living shit
anime,not_removed,i messed that up didnt i teehee
anime,not_removed,well i mean spice wolf in general when lawrences main foe usually ends up being the invisible hand of the market itself its nice to see at least one individual actor who is directly opposing himand to see holo totally save the day
anime,not_removed,s in the end it even made him stronger
anime,not_removed,why does that matter the best characters in anime imo are the ones that still feel real even though everything else is so fantastical
anime,not_removed,that doesnt give him authorization to not be human if you or i got that would you lose your emotionssense of self etc
anime,not_removed,i was talking about skuld aside from last episode i like subaru i even support what he did last episode because from my position i see him knowing that he has to be where the action is in order to have some knowledge about whats going to happen if he wants to put return by death to good use
anime,not_removed,i couldnt feel pity for him since for feeling pity for someone he has to have atleast valuable thing about him since he doesnt have that its pure annoying cringe
anime,not_removed,i think he meant the other character
anime,not_removed,i only hope he gets better as a character it can get darker all it wantsjustplease stop being so dumb
anime,not_removed,yousaidsomethingdumb
anime,not_removed,school days salvaged
anime,not_removed,are are you playing the victim blaming card not rad most unrad
anime,not_removed,sekai was a total bitch on her own
anime,not_removed,just like touya from white album
anime,not_removed,never said otherwise
anime,not_removed,subaru deserved every bit of that
anime,not_removed,exactly shes not
anime,not_removed,while yuno isnt as bad as yuki i couldnt really stand her either im curious why do you like her
anime,not_removed,nothing he did was actually morally wrong aside from the whole taking away someone elses woman thing in other situations hed be admired for being a young entrepreneur no body likes a white knight though
anime,not_removed,i think that by then holo and lawrence grew on a lot of people it made everyone mad to see holo with anyone else
anime,not_removed,oh cool i just started reading the light novels theyre really good
anime,not_removed,i thought it was a good flip of a common trope and is mostly done over the top for the sake of comedy not just for abuse
anime,not_removed,hes basically saying in a super rude way that naruto cant truly understand how he feels since hes never suffered the pain that comes when you lose someonesome people whore super close to you and the accompanying bitterness and frustration sasuke felt by not being strong enough to carry out retribution
anime,not_removed,i mean he did kinda have a point there naruto grew up alone but in the village while sasuke literally watched everyone he loved die at like years old id imagine thatd be more traumatizing anyway maybe insensitive to call naruto out on that but they were in the middle of that whole fight anyway edit whoops autocorrect
anime,not_removed,well he did lose a bit of his humanity s when he ordered his probably best friend to be executedput in prison where he had to fight for survival not the most ethical thing to do
anime,not_removed,really are we forgetting the first episodes yes he was a bit over exuberant and cringy but he still reset himself to save rem decided to sacrifice himself to allow rem and ram to escape and was instrumental in cheering rem up yes he has a bit of a hero complex and thinks emilia owns him but i didnt see much of that when he was with the twins i think the difference is that he doesnt put them on a pedestal as he does with emilia hell even puck likes him and puck can see into someones mind
anime,not_removed,you win
anime,not_removed,guess i misunderstood then apologize
anime,not_removed,the thing is that theyre both right but emilia doesnt and cant know everything that subaru has been through all he wants is some trust and sure he fucked that up in the current timeline but from his perspective hes proven himself trustworthy
anime,not_removed,right subaru deserved it but emilia isnt on the position to speak like that to him what has she done so far
anime,not_removed,she was an unique character on her own
anime,not_removed,why read when you can watch the adaptation is greatexcept that it skip book in the first season
anime,not_removed,i recognize it for the gender reversal but i find it no less annoying than the common violent tsundere they shouldve properly reversed the trope and showed actual legal and social consequences for the abuse instead of reversing the gender that i would applaud
anime,not_removed,ah but this brings me into one of the most unknowingly hot button topics in this sub utilitarianism in rossius view s it was better to murder his friend than have his friends continued antics risk all of humanity much like lord genome before him and the antispirals themselves rossiu chose safety over freedom that restricting everyone for their own good was preferable to allowing someone to accidentally destroy everything while meaning well this is literally the core theme of ttgl and rossiu was merely the next evolution of it that said watching the backstabbing jerk get it in the mouth was a wonderful thing
anime,not_removed,i dont know man hes so annoying to me i dotn like his voice and all his actions jsut seem stupid i wish he would jsut behave like a normal human being instead we see him fail in the most stupid ways that being said i really like the series it has a lot of potential just wished they did a better job with the mc
anime,not_removed,i might be biased since i dont like rem and ram and so i also dont like him saving them
anime,not_removed,petite doesnt just mean loli
anime,not_removed,ill agree that theres a certain amount of uniqueness to yuno in regards to her arc even if i dont really care for her in general ill also say that its a shame the story staples her to yuki so thoroughly because no one deserves that fate to me their relationship was by far the weakest and flimsiest aspect of the show
anime,not_removed,i just prefer reading something before watching the visual adaptation
anime,not_removed,skips volume in the second season fam
anime,not_removed,then it wouldnt be funny
anime,not_removed,i would have probably done the same thing in his shoes his responsibility was tremendous im not surprised he handled it how he did
anime,not_removed,i think hes a fantastic character actually dont get me wrong i hate his guts but its pretty clear hes not supposed to be liked but rather were seeing the side of him thats slowly being fucked up over time
anime,not_removed,cant deny that it wasnt a good thing to do though so he does have at least one valuable thing about him which is why i dont hate but pity subaru
anime,not_removed,i dont find it funny as it is
anime,not_removed,i might have spelled that wrong it was a good thing to do but completly unlogical to suicide for someone that tries to kill you and doesnt like you overall
anime,not_removed,then i guess youre not the target audience
anime,not_removed,she didnt hate him the end of episode was all about him coming to realize that before he just wanted to run away from them not save them but when he realized that she didnt kill him during the first loop and the twins held his hands during the current one he understood that they didnt naturally hate him so it must be something he had done
anime,not_removed,guess not
anime,not_removed,youre right i forgott about that so there is a small error on my part but all in all i still think that suiciding for them wasnt a good idea t all
anime,not_removed,rofl at all the kirito wannabe downvotes continue fighting the good fight tbh
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,the whole gundam franchise the whole macross franchise the whole getter robo franchise and the whole mazinger franchise that will keep you busy for a while
anime,not_removed,a mal list would make things easier
anime,not_removed,what have you watched
anime,not_removed,im watching ore monogatari my love story right now and its really really sweet and i love it and you should watch it too
anime,not_removed,i just finished the girls with guns trilogy and and theyre all pretty good theyre only thematically related girls with lost memories secret organizations and of course girls with guns so you dont have to watch one to watch the others i think madlax is the weakest of the three which is funny because its the one i had heard about the most before watching its not bad by any means i just think it spends too much time floundering about in the beginning and kind of falls apart towards the end it also introduces some fantasy elements that i was not prepared for and that kind of took me out of the story for a little bit noir is somewhere in the middle its good but it didnt really hook me until the second half the first half builds a lot of things up and it feels a little slow at times but all that buildup pays off in the end el cazador is my favorite of the three the two leads nadie and ellis are likable and relatable and have great chemistry theyre also noticeably changed by the end and the development is subtle and believable it also has one of the creepiest villains in la who has one of the rapiest rape faces ive seen in anime
anime,not_removed,bored watch chaika the coffin princess
anime,not_removed,im watching cowboy bebop now and its keeping ke pretty entertained though im a bit late to the game
anime,not_removed,jojos bizarre adventure
anime,not_removed,mmmm i watched couple episodes last night im hooked thanks

anime,not_removed,its your fetish type obviously most people have one
anime,not_removed,theres lots of people in the same boat thats why they keep putting characters like this in anime
anime,not_removed,flat is justice
anime,not_removed,welcome to the boat my dude you have a type i like shy stammering girls a lot personally
anime,not_removed,watch the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya next youll love nagato
anime,not_removed,i never even seen galaxy express but i love just for her images ive seen and now im afraid to watch it and she isnt likable
anime,not_removed,ehh maybe youre right but now i feel like a weirdo based on your reply thanks lol
anime,not_removed,is there somewhere i can watch it legally i have netflix hulu and funimationnow
anime,not_removed,is okay were all weirdos here
anime,not_removed,i think you can watch it on funimation
anime,not_removed,nope its just a number that was made from a keyboard key arrangements or thats what ive read the project gets frozen indefinitely after touman actions so it doesnt really matter now
anime,not_removed,ps
anime,not_removed,something like huh you want to join my harem thats the password i use to unlock your pussy jokes aside he probably would be just dumbfounded and even if there was a serious answer he wouldnt know coz ya know he has no memories after the event of index arc accelerator is the only who would have the answer
anime,not_removed,also continuing from last comment now that i think about it the answer to your post might be in the ln volume of the originalold testament try posting this in rtoarumajutsunoindex or rrailgun
anime,not_removed,and from ghibli
anime,not_removed,cat returns and ocean waves two of ghiblis more mediocre movies

anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomemyspawjpg is actually a coworker of mine middle her sister right and their friend httpimgurcomrrelpkajpg is them the next day i actually took a picture of them but didnt recognize them and moved on without saying hi they told me about it when i texted them that i left but still wanted to see their cosplays for that day
anime,not_removed,a rare yona group fucking darth jar jar tho best one of the album
anime,not_removed,spent most of my time in the artist alley and missed out on a out of cosplays this year
anime,not_removed,wow that looks like an absolute blast
anime,not_removed,i see you seeing that shigatsu wa kimi no uso print i picked that up too i was super excited to see it because i didnt see much art for recent shows that werent super hyped
anime,not_removed,that sheik is on point
anime,not_removed,they look absolutely stunning very jealous of those costumes
anime,not_removed,i know exactly how that feels this was my first fanime and i spent a majority of it in the dealers hall and artist alley
anime,not_removed,aww that gakkou gurashi one is amazing i would have loved to see them
anime,not_removed,same was pleasantly surprised by the slight increase in shigatsu artwork this year
anime,not_removed,she said it was all made by hand except for the shoes and the blue jumpsuit all their costumes are mostly handmade they buy some things online and alter them i think my coworker said the gannondorf one took about hours of work
anime,not_removed,they were there on sunday
anime,not_removed,im always really happy to see merchart for shows that arent one piece naruto hxh or league i get that theyre super popular but its great when more obscure shows get some love
anime,not_removed,its understandable that many artists may prioritize on popular franchises with greater demands im just glad that possibly more people gave ylia a watch last month especially with the english dub release on netflix
anime,not_removed,i know for a fact the netflix release got at least a few people to watch it a few friends of mine just recently got back into anime after watching ylia on netflix
anime,not_removed,so basically trigger made one big joke that is supposed to bait people into thinking that show will have some yuribaiting so its like yuribaiting baiting kyoani just got outdone on the field of faking lesbians i dont know if i should be like sasuga trigger or goddamn trigger you were supposed to save the industry not destroy it
anime,not_removed,i think your analysis makes sense the idea of sucy crushing on akko is pretty adorable
anime,not_removed,well its an interesting analysis and the things your said does makes sense is just that i feel that this is not something that trigger would do i dont see trigger making all this elavorated and subtle development just to bring in some yuri undertones or making a character secretly yuri i think that if trigger wants to address the yuri issue they would do it more straightforward so maybe you are only overthinking about that lefteyed sucy being her inner yuri maybe she just represents the opposite off what she is so she is shy and like cute and lovely things like flowers and girls kissing or maybe it represents some issue that has to do with her left eye that will be explained in the future well see
anime,not_removed,oh yeah theres a possibility this is just one big super yuribait or this could actually be some kind of a real insight on the yuri aspect within sucys character we will never fully know until sucy acts upon her inner impulses or something actually happens with her friendship with akko it might remain an eternal tease at this rate
anime,not_removed,yeah i think this was the ultimate yuri tease episode and it will forever be one unless they do anything substantial with this subplot in the future maybe they will tease it more who knows but i think there has to be something thematically important that the flower sucy is the only left eyed one the one emotion able to overpower everything else at least in terms of the theme showcased in the episode it seems to be fairly yuricentric yeah maybe the left eye thing has a deeper meaning time will tell
anime,not_removed,took me a whole seconds to realize what it was
anime,not_removed,this just reminded me how dope the lilo and stitch opening was
anime,not_removed,it kinda fit
anime,not_removed,wow that got me good
anime,not_removed,they wont even bother to put as much effort as this song
anime,not_removed,i hope lillie become a waifu in the anime but probably not lillie best girl
anime,not_removed,the japanese sure do like hawaii i worked there for months as an english teacher my boss spoke fluent american english yet the only american place he had visited was hawaii hah
anime,not_removed,ashs redesign is ass
anime,not_removed,why is this pokemon series looking like shit
anime,not_removed,its grown on me the anime is pretty entertaining too
anime,not_removed,despite me being one of those wow this looks bad guys at first it only took me full episode to get used to the new visuals the art is totally fine for me now and the animation is really crisp characters are way more lively and expressive and each of the first episodes felt really good

anime,not_removed,honestly no one can give you a correct answer because it was never expanded upon or explained if i had to guess they just had a quota to meet in order to sustain for a certain amount of time and although it wouldnt be forever it was enough time to find other ways to get the energy he probably figures earths potential amount was limited too so getting so much from madoka at that point was good enough
anime,not_removed,madoka just became the strongest witch because no one else even comes close to the sheer amount of potential she had no one can stop her or produce more than what she just released into the universe as far as they were concerned earth is now worthless it probably saved the universe an octosexagintillion amount of years anyways
anime,not_removed,considering madoka had enough power to become madokami or godoka take your pick and live outside the constraints of space and time themselves i suppose he could have meant that such power unleashed from her becoming a witch would last so long that it would fundamentally be infinite
anime,not_removed,i took it to mean that each kyubey gets to return home once theyve met a quota then more are sent to continue the mission
anime,not_removed,it said that because it doesnt make any sense the whole entropy deal has no logic and kyubey is doing this to save the universe ha ha ha kyubey doesnt do anything nor it cant do anything through the whole anime it is a obvious lie to a problem presented like that there is no solution so urabutcher is putting some concepts that doesnt make much logical sense

anime,not_removed,i think you might like log horizon maybe i havent seen the two shows youve mentioned so cant say for sure whether or not they are similar though
anime,not_removed,im not too sure what youre looking for maybe tokyo ghoul it shows two sides of a war between human and ghouls similarly parasyte does the same ive also seen overlord do the same however its only in the light novels and not in the anime im guessing these are what youre looking for but i may be wrong
anime,not_removed,sounds like you want stuff that defies normal story telling conventions and tropes but not really metaphorical arthouse stuff for some reason im blanking kinda hard but this is what comes to mind hataraku maousama maoyuu maou yuusha
anime,not_removed,i take it you are looking for shows that seem to follow a certain style but present a different angle than the pack of shows it is closest to is it just the dramaticdark side or anything that shows a different view here are a couple of shows that have a slightly different twist on some less dark fare is setup like a standard haremstyle show but the characters are mostly aware of the tropes that they embody starts out very similar to many battleharem but sets up the mc in a relationship very early on giving a different take on the high school tournament style with powers genre
anime,not_removed,definitely sounds like you would enjoy shinsekai yori
anime,not_removed,concrete revolutios whole storyline is different compared to others its like a puzzle that you have to piece together
anime,not_removed,you might like princess tutu the first half seems to be an episodic ballet magical girl fantasy with random characters being animals then you get to the second half follows ballets tradition of a light half and a dark half
anime,not_removed,it doesnt have to be fantasy specifically just a story that explores a side of its genre usually not gone down for example death in a romance story
anime,not_removed,i agree with this one the season of log horizon took the genre in some interesting directions

anime,not_removed,hayao miyazaki and the abusive relationship with anime
anime,not_removed,and why doesnt he tell emily about the whitch and his magical power to travel through time i am caught up to the latest episode umm
anime,not_removed,he uses yin shadow magic this doenst mean hes bad lol didnt you watch ep you should know what happens when he tries to talk about return by death
anime,not_removed,spoilers for rezero ahead cant be bothered blacking out the whole thing question is easy just because you use dark magic doesnt make you bad think of it just as him having a rare ability second questions a bit harder he could tell emilia about how he came from another world etc but i think the answer is it wouldnt help anything he very well could have told emilia about the witchs cult going to come and wreck her the next day but i think he thinks itll have a similar effect to when he told greenhaired girl she simply wouldnt believe him and ask how he knew to which emilia would end up dying due to him telling her how he did anyway

anime,not_removed,haruka tomatsu is hella cute
anime,not_removed,its so cute haha i probably sang along to it hundreds of times
anime,not_removed,they are the original singer right
anime,not_removed,yep
anime,not_removed,mob psycho im in love with it and apparently so is everybody else i dont think ive heard of anyone actually disliking it let alone having more than a few small complaints
anime,not_removed,evangelion ones that dont rely on shinji is a pussy
anime,not_removed,i have a friend who dislikes madoka magica but cant articulate his stance ive heard that people who dislike it generally dislike it due to pacing but i thought it was fine and have heard from people who disliked it originally that the movies fixed the pacing making it id like to hear reasons from someone who has a negative opinion on it i dont plan on debating tonight i just want someones regurgitations no matter how insightful or mislead
anime,not_removed,ive never heard anyone say anything bad about ping pong the animation besides people saying that they personally find the art ugly id be curious to see someone try to critique it without bringing up the art style
anime,not_removed,turn a gundam anyone got any real issues with that show edit it seems that the way to avoid people criticising shows you like is to only watch shows nobody watches
anime,not_removed,monogatari series
anime,not_removed,curious to see what people disliked about rakugo the disappearance of haruhi wolf children
anime,not_removed,id be interested in hearing from someone who didnt like flcl for a reason other than that it was too random and confusing

anime,not_removed,serial experiments lain yuru yuri san hai flip flappers madoka magica yuuki yuuna is a hero magical girl lyrical nanoha as code geass simoun i honestly cant think of why anyone would dislike these shows
anime,not_removed,id like to hear some on my hero academia
anime,not_removed,i didnt really like shirobako me and my friend watched it and she adored it we sort of got into arguments regarding the show there were two reasons for this we were binging it and im a firm believer in the fact that episodic shows or bi episodic shows arent meant to be binged watching them a couple times a week is typically better in my opinion that blonde character who everyone just treated like shit really bothered me and i dont know why he was just inserted into the story to be a punching bag i only watched maybe edited because maybe more episodes but i remember when those two artists were in that childish argument and somehow it was turned into this guys fault there would be random times where he was just being a nice guy and someone would snicker at him or bash him or something i get it hes being used as a plot device but it was just so forced i dont want to feel like total shit for the guy when i know thats not the point im supposed to laugh at him but instead their treatment of him just pisses me off because its unreasonable and makes the characters doing it seem like total twats edit again if youre really into the anime industry and especially the art side of the behind the scenes you will be able to look past what i said and the show should be awesome for you she loved it for this reason and so do many of my friends otherwise youll have my problem

anime,not_removed,hibike euphonium i feel like im the only person who didnt find it interesting or find something great about it at all kon i literally havent heard anything bad about kon as for op i really didnt enjoy shirobako because of the first half i couldnt understand anything outside of the things i already know and that probably turned me off a little bit to the show if it wasnt for the moments here and there i wouldve put it on hold for a long ass time even though it was fun i really didnt enjoy watching it at all it felt like a drag completing it to be honest i still gave it a though because it invoked some emotion on me and cute girls are my weakness but other than that i really didnt love it it wasnt something special it was just another anime i watched i liked it but i wouldnt talk about it

anime,not_removed,one punch man everyone seems to praise it to high heaven
anime,not_removed,cowboy bebop
anime,not_removed,i understand how someone can dislike casshern sins but i dont understand how so many people can dislike it that it ends up under on mal thats literally a disgrace to the show beautifully unique art great ost and bgm seriously great concept and the art is directed and positioned strategically in a way to display that concept anyone understanding anything about film and shot strategy can see that all too well many shots are breathtaking now this wouldnt annoy be so much but i just dont understand how shows or manga with similar content yet arguably less cool or shounen such as kinos journey or yokohama kaidashi kikou can become wildly more acclaimed with arguably less of what i just said i mean casshern sins is shows behind kino on mal i dont understand this in the slightest i get how a few people here and there can rag on the art which is actually beautiful and a breath of fresh air but i get it opinions and the pacing but for it to be places behind a show thats arguably worse animation ost less content including actionstories and episodes and generally trying to do the same thing someone who hates it please tell me why with logic so i can make sense of the world

anime,not_removed,katanagatari not because i dont understand people disliking it but im just wondering why other than dropping it early because to me at least the start was pretty dull
anime,not_removed,steinsgate i rarely see it mentioned however the general opinion seems to be that it is very good and i agree i know someone will mention the pacing of the first episodes but i think that we didnt need a whole episode on the rukako date either
anime,not_removed,hunter x hunter other than the massive voice over explanations at certain points havent heard anything bad

anime,not_removed,fullmetal alchemist brotherhood gintama edit im also interested in why someone wouldnt like one punch man
anime,not_removed,haikyuu
anime,not_removed,rezero
anime,not_removed,from what i hear lots of people disliked the first episodes and wished reigen death
anime,not_removed,i disliked the show because the humour just didnt click with me in fact i found it intensely annoying
anime,not_removed,well a lot of people dislike the artstyle for one haha one pun and ive heard a complaint from a friend that the story was really boring i cant quite figure out why he thought so but theres that i guess
anime,not_removed,i disliked the message because its the type of message only someone who hasnt actually been marginalized would say its easy to say you shouldnt define yourself and your selfesteem by your traits when its something cool like telekinetic powers but that doesnt mean you shouldnt be able to take pride in your special traits or aspects the complete rejection of uniqueness the show tries to say is good is just a really bad message for me
anime,not_removed,oh boy this is actually one of the few shows ranime really likes that i didnt i didnt hate it or anything but it was underwhelming for how much buzz it got to me anyway by and large it felt like mob psycho intended to be multiple different things a comedy anime a battle anime and a supernatural anime however to me it really felt like none of these were met especially well the show was funny and the fights were cool but the comedic and serious moments i feel were choreographed really poorly to me it was like the dial kept switching back and forth with no real orogression there just some minor foil for mob to hit then go super saiyan for instance s when mob fights blond guy for the first time at first this is treated with comedy since mob is so much more op than blonde guy and how mob underreacts to the supernatural battle occurring its supposed to be funny the dial switches again to serious when blonde guy is choking mob to death and mob nearly dies then a minute or two later the blonde guy is flying in the air naked with a buzzed head s same deal with the fight with dimple they do milk drinking contests trying not to laugh and again mobs underreaction to everything going on is funny then a minute or two later mob is getting dogpiled and suddenly at the progression just seemed to blindside you i kept expecting a comedy to serious back to comedy progression like id see with most shounen but itd bounce around and make sudden switches never really establishing itself as serious because it dials back to comedy so quick unlike one punch man mob psycho intends to treat itself seriously at points but feels forced because of the overwhelmingly facetious and comedic tone of the rest of the show s aside from that the whole spiritsupernatural deal didnt feel important the first episode is spent with mob exorcising demons and showing how reigen is a cheat but this spirit ability isnt important at all throughout the series with the exception of seeing dimple it just felt like the show was really trying to hit all points and didnt hit any for me maybe because i was trying to look at it either like a traditional shounen or like opm it just didnt do it for me unlike other people i guess
anime,not_removed,i either disliked or didnt care at all for any character i hated reigen so much that by the time he wasnt being shit anymore i couldnt warm up to him in time the animation which was well animated sometimes suffered from being too fastpaced and hard to follow it wasnt a bad show but it was not at all special to me
anime,not_removed,reigen is a terrible person and the show treats him like an unintentional hero the plot is very stale evil organisation check op protagonist check the only unique aspect was with the brother but he was a terrible person too with no good justification for some reason the show wants to redeem bad people without any reason for redeeming them mob was the simplest character in the cast but at least he was somewhat decent hair guy was irrelevant aside from his specific episode comic relief interrupted serious learning moments and the fights themselves didnt have much weight behind them when they involved mob because we knew who would win it tried to bite off more than it could chew if it stuck to being a simple story with simple characters it would have turned out better but because it attempts to tackle complex things and does a poor job of it its not a good show
anime,not_removed,i love the show myself but the one gripe i had with it is how reigen starts as a cowardly con artist who uses mob but as soon as the first episode ends he does a and every scene involving him and mob stresses how he looks out for him and he goes out of his way jumping into dangerous situations to help mob or his brother he still uses him for his own gain but these actions are always shown in a light hearted manner as if to say we shouldnt judge him too harshly for that i dont mind if he ends up as the unlikely role model everyone loves but i thought it wouldve be much more interesting if there was a gradual arc to him
anime,not_removed,i still liked mob psycho but out of it and one punch man i feel like opm explored its premise more fullyreached its true potential more
anime,not_removed,the ending was horrible a reset to status quo is something only harem anime should do not a serious characterdriven story like mob
anime,not_removed,i actually really disliked the first half i didnt care about anything going on and i didnt care about any of the characters once it got to about episode it really picked up and i enjoyed it but i really had to push myself to get to that point
anime,not_removed,this isnt really about the show itself its more about why i personally didnt like it to me watching nge was like reading great expectations in english class theres a lot to write about academically and i can easily see why people love it but i didnt enjoy getting through it at all i know the characters in nge are meant to be awful unlikable people i understand why everyone hates each other i know the plot is supposed to be confusing it doesnt change the fact that i really hate shows featuring those things i like having a likable protagonist to rally behind and people who are angry and depressed really stress me out i watched it while i was struggling with depression and it just put me in an even worse state of mind haha i mean everyones even more miserable at the end of the show than they were in the beginning i can appreciate nge from an objective standpoint the art direction is phenomenal cruel angels thesis is one of my favorite ops the characters are welldeveloped and theres a lot of depth to the animes themes it just wasnt for me
anime,not_removed,gendos motivation is pure insanity
anime,not_removed,characterization is phenomenal despite that the writing is atrocious yes the story does add more depth to the philosophies and subliminal tones of the story but its still bad
anime,not_removed,personally i like evangelion but ive heard a lot of criticisms that are true it all comes down to the severe lack of exposition which evangelion no doubt suffers from
anime,not_removed,they didnt bother making an ending that made sense just said hey lets just smack an acid trip on it and call it deep and some bullshit and people wont care i care i fucking loathe that ending
anime,not_removed,i just have trouble with characters and not really liking the plot nothing bad about writing or plot holes but i dont tend to like stuff where i dont really like the characters
anime,not_removed,personally i neither liked it nor did i dislike it however due to that i do have some complaints with it the first and foremost being subjective i didnt enjoy it i figure that if i wasnt binge watching it with my friends i probably wouldnt have finished it furthermore i dont think its a very good deconstruction nor do i think it has anything in it that makes it more than a dark take on magical girls and even in that i felt that in the darkness that it had it was a bit shoehorned i didnt feel fully conveinced of the reasons behind the darkness rather it felt like it was being dark for the sake of dark which is something im really not a fan of also madoka the character isnt that good of a character i will note stuff like madoka really isnt my scene to begin with so my opinions are colored by that im much more of a fan of soft fluffy type of stuff
anime,not_removed,madoka magica i dont like the writing the characters motivations are not really that good imho i feel like theyre very basic and madoka as a character annoyed me and i could not really find myself sympathizing with her you can say there is a meta reason for her being useless but since that reason is not revealed until later it hurts the episodes where we dont know this reason when this reason is revealed it doesnt retroactively make me enjoy the rest of the series it just makes me think that it should have been revealed much sooner the pacing is too slow and the show doesnt do a good job of making me care for the characters especially mami homura was kinda cool but i mean why wouldnt she want to save mami or the blue haired girl as well if she really cared about madoka then she wouldve tried to save them too bc m really loved her friends i think homura had a good motivation but it was only revealed towards the end and i think it hurts the earlier episodes bc her character is pretty static the show tries to explore these deep ideas but never really got them across in a satisfying way i felt like the emotional scenes were bland and trying way too hard i also did not like the character designs wtf is up with those chins
anime,not_removed,way too much suffering i guess i mean it just focuses so much on making it seem like the world is terrible place that i just dont care about anything if the world sucks so much why would i want to see characters succeed why would they even try to do anything if it ends up in suffering no matter the outcome yuyuyu was a lot better in this regard when s itsuki loses her voice and then her sister learns about how she got accepted for some singing contest or whatever that was i legitimately cared about them and was sad it was a simple trick but it worked it made me feel that those girls got really shitted on by the world and fate madoka did not had anything like that because if everything is shit anyway why does it matter if the fate shits on you a bit more
anime,not_removed,the first or so eps have boring shit pacing the first ep is legit bad the developments in ep to happen too quickly and feel rushed the ending eps are great
anime,not_removed,i havent completed it yet dropped at ep plan to finish it some day the only complaint i could level against it is that it tosses faust quotes around as gracefully as monkey flings shit the same is true of zetsuen no tempest which even contains an error from hamlet o
anime,not_removed,for how dark it wanted to be it was fairly mild in comparison its ending was just kind of dumb but to me the biggest problem i had was i cant name a single thing in madoka magica i hadnt seen somewhere else done more effectively and i couldnt find the one thing that made me care about it enough that that didnt matter also it has my least favourite dumb thing parents being conveniently trusting of their child beyond all reason when there is literally no reason for them to be in a situation where they would have to be there so they could let the child go off to die without knowing
anime,not_removed,i kinda hate madoka fans more than madoka i think the series and even rebellion are great even if i despise certain characters at certain points i feel the community makes way too much out of the whole homuramadoka thing
anime,not_removed,pacing is one thing madoka nails though
anime,not_removed,hard to pin exactly why but i just never cared for any of the characters except for maybe kyouko and sayaka the main duo of homura and madoka never clicked with me and i struggled to be invested in them i guess to me they were just really boring and dry to watch fight scenes aside and rebellion was worse it was just pure grimdark for the hell of it in my opinion
anime,not_removed,i like the show but it is firmly capped at very good due to its mediocre characters even homura is more valuable as an idea than she is as an explicit character within the show itself kyubey is cool though
anime,not_removed,i feel like even if you dislike everything else about madoka you have to at least admit that the art and directing is absolutely phenomenal
anime,not_removed,the movies fixed the pacing making it i liked the series enough to give it an for storycharacters for great visuals and music but i hated the movie i wasnt especially fond of homura during the tv series but the movie turned her into a creepy abusive stereotypical psycho lesbian the movie was an unnecessary addition that weakened the integrity of the series the side story stuff looks like crap too im not even touching that i once saw somebody describe pmmm as a magical girl anime for bronies and yeah it does kinda feel like that at times theres something really unsettling about the whole bad things happening to adorable moe girls genre too i liked the series but i feel like id probably like it a lot less on a rewatch where i dont have the excitement of whats going to happen next week to look forward to
anime,not_removed,s pecos redemption story was unbelievable at best a guy who got out of the game and then suddenly with a bit of training beats an olympian whos been training his whole life and then beating smile who in addition to being very talented at it actually put in the effort to be the best i couldnt stand that in addition the show sort of mixed up its messages at the end they tried to go with practice makes perfect sort of moral ending but they botched that with how easily peco becomes an olympian and everyone else just washes up on the streets peco being given the focus at the end broke the show which was so far about smile who had honesttogoodness talent and who started genuinely training and caring for the sport for him to end up a tt teacher was lame its still one of my favorite shows ever
anime,not_removed,pecos instant development powerup was a turn off for me smile china had the whole season to develop nicely peco not so much too powerful too soon you dont go from loser who doesnt practice to national champion in just one tourney
anime,not_removed,in all honesty i found the show incredibly boring i felt no hype whatsoever during their games i also couldnt really care about the characters people have always said that it had great character development but that doesnt really matter when you dont care about the characters at all in all fairness though i probably missed the characterisation because i was too busy being bored and really had trouble actually paying attention to the episodes when i was watching it
anime,not_removed,they didnt even show the last match for some reason
anime,not_removed,if you dont care about the characters its insanely boring
anime,not_removed,turn a is a lovely show but its writing can really go all over the place tominos writing has a tendency to veer off into insane tangents from time to time but it was almost too much in turn a especially with some of the characters just willfully steering the conversation and the dramatic moment into some insane comedic tangent he sometimes let the eccentric characters express their eccentricities a bit too much to the detriment of the drama and storytelling
anime,not_removed,turn a is my second favorite show but i have some criticisms for it right after the s nuclear bomb goes off loran runs right out of the mobile suit to look at the effects of it despite the fact that it should by at the most radioactive and even the radioactivity warning went off on the land ship the inca aztec or temple arc whatever feels kind of unneeded its neat that we get to see an entirely removed culture but the fact that loran gets a newtype flash randomly is able to psychically communicate with the king and then its dropped completely seemed like a really big asspull to just force the hostilities between them to end not to mention i feel like it doesnt really add anything also a ton of characters are kind of glossed over mostly militia members and some of the moonrace come across as really one dimensional which would be whatever if it werent for the fact that the main portion of the cast gets a fairly insane amount of characterization compared to everyone else
anime,not_removed,the writing and pacing meandered all over the damned place granted its been some time since i saw the show all the way through but i dont recall a whole lot of consequence even happening in the story between the initial attack and everyone going to space i still like it on the whole but i feel it could have been a third of the length it was and nothing of value would be lost also sochie is a total bitch
anime,not_removed,the monogatari series is my second favorite of all time but the people who have a problem with the oversexualization of almost all the female characters are well within their rights to dislike it for that reason even if i personally think that the show has a solid internal reasoning for why all the female characters are overly sexualized s our narrator is usually a depressed perverted teenage boy and it can be argued that him seeing them as only sexually attractive shows that he doesnt really have romantic inclinations towards them as noted by how senjougaharas portrayal after he falls in love with her changes from sexual to sensual and when it isnt its either a sexually frustratedrepressed hanekawa or kaiki who doesnt see any of the characters sexually and kanbaru in hanamonogatari but i havent watched that yet also ononokis line about shame does a pretty good job acknowledging that araragis actions are reprehensible he may lewd the girls as he pleases but they dont exist solely to be lewded and in fact them being lewded makes them uncomfortable in a lot of cases
anime,not_removed,toothbrush
anime,not_removed,i dropped bakemonogatari at episode but i cant really articulate why it didnt do much for me i think its mainly because i have add and often dont do well with dialogueheavy shows especially since the humor wasnt really my taste there also wasnt too much of an overarching narrative from what i remember so that might have also contributed to why i couldnt get into it edit i just want to add that i dont dislike the show at all it just didnt hold my attention long enough so it kind of fell by the wayside
anime,not_removed,my biggest problem is that so much of it seems like what somebody in the middle of puberty thinks maturity sexuality and intelligence is while thats certainly the setting in terms of who the characters are and i cant deny that chances are had i watched it when it aired i would have loved that about it watching it now feels like im trying to get into the mentality of a teenager just to enjoy it
anime,not_removed,the only arcs that i really enjoyed were shinobu time and hitagi end the rest were average or bad so i didnt see the need to carry on after ss
anime,not_removed,i know monogatari series is good but the way people talk about it like some kind of masterpiece just annoys me
anime,not_removed,i never have any interest in this series so sorry
anime,not_removed,strictly for bake because thats all i watched i like the style of the show i like the animation though the slideshow cutaways arent my favorite im fine with individual arcs and such but i do not care about these characters at all i find them exceedingly uninteresting which makes the stories theyre involved in uninteresting i found the senjougahara and araragi spelling romance uncompelling outside of that one date episode which i fully admit is among my favorite individual episodes and is probably the only reason why i dont regret the time i spent watching the show the fanservice doesnt help whether tasteless obtrusive or downright unnecessary i neither wanted it or thought the show ever needed it it was at its core a tropey harem not funny enough to excuse silliness and not serious enough to make its romances compelling
anime,not_removed,if i had to criticize the monogatari series i would do it first per arc and then as a whole like bake doesnt really have a interesting plot araragi meets x girl she has a problem araragi helps them to the next girl and is only thanks to the amazing dialogue that it gained popularity which is not really a bad thing since the series is character driven but still also while i often heard that the change from bake to nise wasnt really welcome due to the fanservice bake was really unrefined especially scenes that to me looked bad and out of place and dont really add anything to the story like some shots are there only because they are strange and would catch the eye like some instances that goes to real life shots but since bake was the first of the series is understandable that they wanted to experiment they learned from that and nise looks nicer and the shots actually adds to the dialogue but then they wanted to go for fanservice so yeah nekokuro tsuki koyomi and owari feel weak in comparison with bake nise ss and even hana well owari for a reason different of kuro and tsuki the dialogue in kuro tsuki and koyomi feel simple dont have as much depth or interesting visuals as the rest of the series and since that is the biggest strenght of the series it really hurts also not too much happens in them we pretty already know what happened in kuro tsuki throws some wink wink here and there and koyomi is just tying things well i guess what happens at the end of koyomi is something in owari it feels they wanted to go safer by explaining things and not having too many scenes with complex visuals which it isnt really a bad thing if it wasnt that they went for explaning what happened in x scene immediately after it happened which again wouldnt be a bad thing if it wasnt that owari also falls hard into my next point the series as a whole has this tendency lets call it that of falling in love with what is saying what i mean by that is that it can get so immersed into what and how it wants to say something that it goes on and on and on which lead to really heavy and sometimes fast dialogues that could be summarized with fewer words or explained through visuals this in my opinion hurts him more often than help him because of its visuals since there are moments where they also go overdrive this makes neccesary to pause andor rewind sometimes multiple times in some scenes which doesnt make a really pleasent experience imo going back to owari this arc in particular has some of the longest dialogues in the series that have multiple subtleties but then it explains the deal behind that in the same or the next and it kinda loses the point of going through the whole thing another thing is that araragi is not really a likeable character yet imo ill explain or at least not as much as to be the winner in best male characterprotag i forgot which one was it yeah he may be a fun guy and the banter between him and the girls is cool but honestly my favorite arcs are the one where hes the least involved hes an extreme pervert which might be fun most of the time but it can get unconfortable pretty fast in some parts like the toothbrush scene and some with hachikuji also some of his actions and sometimes lack of really grind my gears but these are more of my opinion on those parts of his character what really makes him not so likeable is that he hasnt gotten to the part of his development that makes me say he really has changed hasnt he he has been shit by others for his personality actions and ideals he shits himself about that i shit him about that and i know that a lot do too but at the point the series is in owarithe last of koyomi being the last events to happens in the timeline the only thing we have gotten from him is yeah im shit but thats the way i am and im loved either way so no changes or at least not the ones that makes him a fully developed character and that redeems him from how he was throughout the whole series as of yet this may change since there are still content to adapt but right now not really ill finish saying that i like the series it may not be my favorite but it deserves praise even though i dont consider it masterpieces
anime,not_removed,wolf children ive been waiting for my chance to spout bile towards this sorry if my opinion i guess i dont like it because its basically a first world view of what poverty is and with this i mean that poverty is an almost noble thing in this movie and i know this is basically a movie about the strugles of a single mother but the way its written it totally seems like it was written by someone who has not had a single day of hunger in his life i dont know how to explain this but something is off about this moviei would ilustrate this with an example you know when you see a movie with a black woman in it but by the way she talks you can tell she was written by a white middle aged guy well this movie is like that to someone who has seen real poverty this can be ilustrated by stuff like how the characters act how the community is managed how the kids act i would have to go over the movie again to give more details since i dont remember eerything but this is my general impression
anime,not_removed,the disappearance of haruhi wonder what brought you to ask about this one nonetheless the grandfather paradox is a notable one though is attempted to be explained with how the tpdd works in later novels its still pretty fucky rakugo it can be boring to some while some people really like slow drama series others do not and thats very apparent with things like the currently airing acca which i absolutely love but a lot of people have been saying its incredibly slow otherwise the rakugo itself can be a bit off because its designed for the japanese language so the jokes sometimes dont make sense cause the punchline comes first or otherwise its just a japanese cultural reference that westerners wont get wolf children the bestiality aspect can be a turnoff regardless of how minor it was otherwise it probably just lies on how much you can stand kids if you dont like kids you wont like a movie focused on the raising of kids especially given how well it portrays those kids at being kids
anime,not_removed,rakugo can be a little too understated at times considering that the manga uses more vibrant imagery and character expressions while the anime uses more subtlety which could be seen as not adapting the manga the right way i like the different approach with the anime though
anime,not_removed,i felt frustrated that hahuri wasnt the season plot anyway it is exceedingly long it absolutely did not need to be hours and the emotional climax is dependent on accepting perhaps the most explicit waifu bait this side of rezero
anime,not_removed,rakugo i cant be sure because a lot of issues were a lack of investment in the narrative but i think the jarring flashback after an hour long episode through me out of tune with the show so my investment was not in the current but in trying to grasp what the current was and how much of a part it was going to play by the end i just couldnt grasp the drama and it felt so overplayed and illogical this season has explained as to why i felt that way tbf and just found myself struggling to create an investment this season runs into some of those issues for me aswell its definitely better than season but it always seems to say just a slight bit too little leaving me questioning elements that shouldnt need questioning throwing me off kilter with the shows here and now
anime,not_removed,i like rakugo but it defies why im even watching anime in the first place as in being animated adds nothing to watching the show it may as well have been liveaction and would have been equally as good if you want to say rakugo is a storytelling masterpiece go right ahead but for anyone to say as an entire anime it stands among the best of the decade or of all time i cannot even remotely agree because it lacks the enormous innovative capabilities that come with animating a story i feel like it started to fix this in the new season but at the cost of what i considered to be the best part of the show in essence the dynamic between bon sukeroku miyokichi etc and nothing in the new season has really filled that for me except some of konatsus scenes because of this the past episode that the entire discussion thread was considering totally tearjerking and emotional was by far the worst episode in its entire episode run so farfor me anyway
anime,not_removed,rakugo i started watching season when it started airing and dont know how many episodes in i got but i really got fed up with backstory i wanted to know what was happening in the present so i just dropped it after some weeks
anime,not_removed,wolf children i know this is a kind of a general anime complaint but the ages of the two children were way too young there is the fact that they are part wolf so they probably grow up quicker as a counterbalance but still like yuki is only and ame by the end of the film
anime,not_removed,i never connected to anything happening and thats a weird experience things happened on the screen but i never felt like a part of it i didnt connect even slightly to any of the characters didnt help that at least in the dub everyone besides kari wahlgren sounded bored beyond belief and i never understood why or how anything was happening i just went along with it to get the show over i was so disengaged by the ending that i didnt even register there was a greater theme going on i was just relieved that i finished the show and its only episodes also i didnt think the jokes were funny
anime,not_removed,i think its core metaphorical themes could have been concealed a bit better its themes are a tad on the nose with even a moderate introspection
anime,not_removed,minor thing the artanimation there are scenes where the background would disappear though i only one i remember is in just becoming plain white its just so unusual for me that it left a bad taste in my mouth the other thing is its not what i thought it would be everywhere where i see flcl being mention on reddit mal etc what ill always see are praises how its so great because of this and that and the youre in for a joyride i held such a high expectation of it and when i finally checked what the fuzz is all about theres just disappointment i feel like im just wasting my time but i thought to myself maybe it gets better in next episodes but it never came in short i found it overrated the humor i liked the silly faces but thats just about it the jokes arent funny the slapstick humor isnt funny overall its just boring theres not a thing that kept me engaged there are moments where id fall asleep for a moment because its either uninteresting or reasons other than confusing i know but still i have a hard time comprehending whats happening the characters theyre memorable but oddly enough i cant recall their names lol i quite liked all of them except for the main pinkhaired girl at first i thought she was a he until later in personally i found her character design unattractive and her personality annoying this was the feeling i can recall but i cant remember the reasons why the story in which its nonexistent also as you say it too random and confusing now i dont think its is entirely bad but i guess the show is just not for me there are some cool and funny scenes but because of the disappointment i cant think highly of the flcl
anime,not_removed,love it personally but ive heard the complaint that its too episodic in nature and it doesnt feel like akko is developing any as a character recent episodes really call that into question though
anime,not_removed,maybe the first movie set the standards too high but the rest just cant be compared to it its a bit too sol for some people i heard and theres no real danger like in harry potter for example
anime,not_removed,ok take this with a grain of salt since it has been forever since i watched it code geass has the same problems that death note does imo the genius characters dont come off as intelligent as they are supposed to be and their master plans tend to involve a ton of asspulls and require the rest of the cast to be holding the idiot ball to work the mechs werent bad though
anime,not_removed,i love flip flappers but i definitely understand why someone would dislike it a lot of people were disappointed that they attempted to establish a coherent narrative in the last half and although i appreciated the story i see why someone might have an issue with it given how late in the show they started developing it and the story and its massive scale it makes sense to me that someone might think it didnt leave itself enough time to flush out its narrative and should have kept its episodic formula its not my personal opinion but i get why someone might dislike it
anime,not_removed,yryr really didnt feel that similar to the previous seasons it felt like they were going for less focus on comedy and tried to make it feel more iyashikei a lot of the energy that the first two seasons had wasnt as present in
anime,not_removed,the writing in code geass especially in was downright awful just as an example s the battle in china that was ultimately resolved by super secrit uber mech that annihilated the enemy army because fuck all the strategy that actually got you there right and whatever happened to whatever sickness li xingke had they created all that drama about how little time he has to live and then he straight up lived to the very end
anime,not_removed,flip flappers i really wasnt a fan of this show mainly because i felt the overall story and the characters were especially lackluster it was fine at the beginning when we didnt really know where the show was headed but once the plot was finally set in motion it just felt incredibly underwhelming and disappointing
anime,not_removed,serial experiments lain i liked serial experiments lain but the pacing felt pretty wonky at times certain elements also kind of felt like they were just reaching for symbolism s like the alien also there is some minor plot holes like the fact that she is all of a sudden able to afford all of this nifty computer stuff that no one ever mentions throughout the series all that being said i still liked the series im just playing devils advocate
anime,not_removed,people who hate moe and cringe when they see it prob would not be fond of some of those shows
anime,not_removed,flip flappers should have stayed an episodic series through out instead of trying to add all these story elements in the last half the singular episodes where the conflict is resolved by the end were the best ones because they were able to develop the characters at the end of the conflict yet also had no need to address any complicated overarching narrative
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,yuuki yuuna is a hero pulls off the dramatic storyline of little girls met with an ill fate much less well than madoka magica with a grandiose nonending of statusquo return to conformity character drama is intense and extremely well done but at the end it feels like we are where we started which is absolutely the wrong way to spend four hours i still liked it though except for that will watch the movies too code geass lelouch and all his smarts cannot win against writers putting stack upon stack of unfortunate developments against him suzaku is completely hypocritical even when faced with the obvious of what he is doing it wastes time on completely pointless filler episode and then wants us to continue to believe that it wants to be taken seriously worst gayobsessed character ever its a mental illness simoun the voice acting jp or voice directing style bothered me flat speaking for most of everything coupled with the quite sterile animation doesnt immerse me at all in the characters and their emotions everything else due to this felt quite boring unfortunately its an interesting world but the dialogue was so inexpressive it was putting me off majorly it also starts to feel pretty samey with the way the battles unfold nowhere does what happens in the first episode happen again up until where i watched halfway
anime,not_removed,flip flappers you say i definitely did not like that one let me just copypaste what i wrote in comments of the anime awards winners post sometimes i feel like im the only one on this subreddit who didnt think flip flappers was really that good i really enjoyed the first half or so and i think the first half to twothirds is really strong however i think flip flappers really fell on its face in the last third once the s mimi arc started before that the show did a really good job of show dont tell to develop its characters and themes even if all the imagery was super obvious and even though the plot was basically nonexistent it didnt really need one either the show was about cocona papika and their friendshiprelationship and everything else was pretty much extraneous then the plot kicks in to gear and suddenly the show is slapping you in the face telling not showing the viewer everything it also built up a ton of plot threads that it just totally left hanging especially in the last few episodes s what was the point of the third kkk child what was the point of making buuchan super buff why did salt need to go into pure illusion at the end you can actually pinpoint when the show starts to go downhill by looking at the reddit discussion threads early on theyre filled with people analysing each episode to draw out as much of the themes and relationship development as they can later episodes are just filled with oh man flfl is so good atoy and not a lot else i dont think it deserves to win best adventure im also not blown away by flip flappers art style sure it was nice but two of the others in that category jojo and mob psycho i think are stronger if there was ever an anime i would describe as stylish its jojo and especially part its when araki starts to switch from his brick shithouse art style to his fashion art style and i think it looks fantastic not to mention the fact that the whole show is super colourful and lively mob psycho on the other hand embraced the source materials quality and i think made something very unique i also mentioned in that voting thread that there was another show that i thought deserved to win that wasnt nominated kabaneri this is absolutely the one i would have voted for if it had been an option you can find that comment or a more expanded version of my thoughts on that
anime,not_removed,flip flappers the build up animation and spooky elements of the first few episodes kept me engaged long enough to make me come back to a group of characters that i really didnt care about the plot kicked in way too late into the show and by that time i had grown bored of watching characters who to me at least hadnt been developed beyond genki girl and just kinda cynical i didnt dislike flip flappers it just lost my interest and in the end i just thought it was okay
anime,not_removed,yuru yuri san hai doesnt have these small details like the older seasons for example akariin or in the time travel episode the first opening just small details you wont really notice
anime,not_removed,of these ive seen i gave lain a san hai a ff an pmmm a yuyuyu a and simoun a ill explain the reasons behind ones i didnt give lain it was expertly using horror techniques to build tension and then suddenly pulled the rug from underneath at the climax before scenechanging a couple times i let it off but it did this so much that it became apparent the writing often didnt know how to cope with these scenes shows like madoka magica do entire episode cuts or cut to credits to get around this whereas lains often happened midepisode its a minor gripe but watching it was a pain because of this flip flappers it did all this exposition and character development to lead to a climax that was a massive letdown that journey there was a masterpiece but the ending was a s weak boss battle repeated with repeated and not explored imagery followed by a wherearetheynow montage that felt like it was missing a lot either continue with episodic or improve the weak narrative and i would like it a whole lot more yuyuyu brilliant showweak ending though im reserving the chance to change my mind in regards to the ending with the series handling of it there is room to make the weak writing of the seriesfinale another incredible journey
anime,not_removed,while i liked flip flappers the overall story isnt good it could have been done a lot better but it leaves the watchers with some unresolved plot lines that could have been solved if the story was planned better and specially focused coconas growth around the themes of family and not so much if she likes or not papika because theres a lot of that that in the end doesnt tie into anything that the show ultimately tackles storywise
anime,not_removed,the randomness of pure illusion is what made me dislike flip flappers sure it is supposed to be surreal and colorful but theyre just way too random with all the weird things and creatures
anime,not_removed,i felt like it would be something a old version of myself would like a lot more having exhausted myself with superhero stuff thanks to marvel and dc i just felt this added nothing new to the table at all the tropes are all played completely straight and none of the characters were at all memorable except for maybe all might it didnt help that the entire first season felt like a prologue with only hints towards a larger plot
anime,not_removed,deku is pretty annoying and not much happened until the last like episodes
anime,not_removed,i found the series to be really average mostly because i found the pacing to be too slow and i found deku annoying i did love the ost though for what its worth
anime,not_removed,too many characters that dont get fleshed out enough judging by all the new character designs for the tournament arc i have been seeing for a while now instead of fleshing out the already large cast they have they are including even more characters into the mix idk whats going to happen in the tournament arc but i can already see myself caring even less about whats happening on screen due to all the new characters and their powers that would need time to be introduced id rather they do a chuunin exam style and only introduce a couple characters but mostly use the arc just to flesh out all the other characters we already are aware of but know very little about
anime,not_removed,i agree with most people that it was slow i was pretty bored watching it until episode or so
anime,not_removed,it took too long to get going and i dont even know if season is going to get to the good stuff
anime,not_removed,nothing much is happening to deku even though he has ofa he can still be pretty much defeated by anyone in the series its average to me but still gives me hype from time to time
anime,not_removed,its average im kinda bored with hero theme in anime
anime,not_removed,deku and bakugo rivarly is one of the worst ones ive seen like it baffles me to think they could have been friends its forced and poorly achieved
anime,not_removed,its really damn slow for an adaption chapters into a episode series is not a good pace hopefully the second season does better at it especially since itll likely adapt chapters into cour
anime,not_removed,ochako too blatant
anime,not_removed,my friend works for a game developer the part where the director felt something was wrong about the crying scene yet couldnt put his finger on it until the studio had to put together an emergency meeting to help the director brainstorm its good theres nothing wrong with it but i dont know why i dont like itrevived some real life trauma in him
anime,not_removed,well blond guy was at fault for the argument he lazily paraphrased what the two guys actually said and it made them believe that the other had said that cgihand drawn animation was bad both were passionate about their craft so am argument was had
anime,not_removed,i just thought it was unsatisfying i liked it but i definitely left feeling like it didnt accomplish enough for toradora i only liked ami everyone else seemed to be portrayed as a very heavy exaggeration of something
anime,not_removed,i just couldnt connect to any of the characters in tatami galaxy they just completely reset all development for them every episode s and in my opinion ozu was just an asshole who had no redeemable qualities but the show just says oh its all fine now for some reason
anime,not_removed,s too many tatami mats too much looping too much old lady poor animation redo your life themes which are cringe worthy at best since theyre a rejection of reality predictable conclusion ozu is a pointless antagonist and it lacks originality besides the poor animation style
anime,not_removed,i enjoyed toradora overall but i hated taiga so much i just found her so unlikeable and the last couple of episodes felt really forced to me
anime,not_removed,s all of the realities before the last one were shown only exist to show that main character how to approach his reality they didnt matter by themselves time reset for the end is lazy because it means that that mc doesnt have to deal with any consequences and that everything else that happened doesnt really matter anymore since the lesson has been learned ozu is a yuge asshole without redeeming qualities but is forgiven in the end the episodes with kaori were just weird
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,toradora generally unlikeable cast of characters aside from pink hair girl teen melodrama extremely juvenile portrayal of romance from beginning to end though one could argue thats the point cuz its a teen romcom not actually that funny for whats supposed to be a comedy deus ex machina bullshit ending never felt like it did much of anything impressive to make up for its shortcomings the swimsuit episode was funny though
anime,not_removed,re toradora i honestly didnt care for the two main characters i found ryuuji to be uninteresting and forgettable and i couldnt stand taiga the latter was extremely puzzling for me as i normally love tsunderes even the ahem more physical ones there was something about taiga i couldnt quite stomach too irrational or too snotty or her decisions would just outright annoy me it got to the point where i just didnt care for her as a character so when her backstory was revealed or any of her meaningful moments happened there was little effect to be had on me going back to ryuuji i basically found him boring i know he had the bad guy looks with a heart of gold trope going for him the cleaningcooking schtick but i struggled to find anything of interest outside of that was he relatable was he smart was he witty was he charming was he inspiring you dont have to be all of those but for me as an mc you really need to sell it in at least one of those categories to make you interesting to put things in perspective across episodes there was only one scene containing ryuuji that evoked a reaction from me where i actually jerked my head back and barked with laughter the rest was me disinterestedly watching an awkward guy with a delinquent look and a cleaning fetish secretly fawn over a crush of his which brings me to content im not even kidding when i say this but i read fanfiction about ten years ago that had a similar plot btvs if you must know this was nothing new to me and i had predicted the ending straight from the beginning this in itself isnt exactly a bad thing but when you also dont care for either main characters its basically an uphill battle trying to like the show you dont care for the character interactions you dont care for the backstory you dont care for the subplots and when youve already got an idea of how its going to end it starts to feel like youre wasting your time that said not everything i have to say about toradora is bad i really liked ami to me she seemed like the most real character there among the cast and i enjoyed a lot of what she had to say conversely i also liked minori although not nearly as much as ami while she had a bit of an exaggerated characterization i felt she had this kind of ideal that you could respect admire and aspire to i also loved kaichou and that one particular scene you know the one tldr didnt care for the two main characters which really made it hard for such a character driven show
anime,not_removed,toradora failed to impress me i set my expectations quite high since everyone loves it so much but ehh it was just boring the characters were unlikable as well expect for the main dude and his mom
anime,not_removed,weird and ugly imo art no likable characters episodes thats highly repetitive sometimes the reason for disliking a show is simple enough
anime,not_removed,my main problems with no game no life is that there is never anything at stake you know that sora and shiro are always going to win anyway and when the entire show is focused around playing games that really removes any level of suspense the characters are fairly bland and uninteresting given the fact that theyre apparently genuines if im watching a show that features character with supposedly iq its really staggering when they act just as stupid as the average harem protagonist just for comedy purposes sora and shiro never acted like the supposed geniuses that they were and that really bothered me if you make a character he a genius write them in a way that makes them feel like one the kubikiri cycle for example does this the lack of proper character writing and development also goes for jibril and most other supporting characters they feel unoriginal and fall back on pretty basic tropes they lack a level of personality to make them feel unique and characterised and because they lacked that personality most of the cast was forgettable lastly the humor in the series was one that is found in a lot of other shows most jokes are ones that can we grouped with ones youd find in most other shounen comedy shows and the humor overall felt uninspired and predictable i dont hate the series and i did give it a but i think overall its pretty mediocre
anime,not_removed,for no game no life aside from the fan service i found sora to be a really unlikable character and shiro to just be bland there was also some weird pseudo incest undertones that bothered me is that filed under fan service there was also things like s sora cheating in that game of five card draw no clarification is provided as to how he cheated just that he did it felt pretty lazy
anime,not_removed,i love no game no life and its fanservice although overdone sometimes but there were some moments when i felt there wasnt as much enjoyment as other parts ill keep it short but i wish that the main two didnt win so easily even though thats the whole point its interesting to see how they win and oneup their opponents but the fact that they win so flawlessly without even hesitating or making up a sweat makes it less enjoyable the other thing i dont like is stephanie always being played off as the dumb one shes smart and fun to watch so i wish they stopped with the jokes making fun of her its been quite a while since ive watched the anime though and perhaps she may have become treated more seriously later on in the light novels
anime,not_removed,sora goes beyond the stereotypical neet isekai protagonist with questionable views on women to would be in jail irl for sexual assault i can handle the fanservice but the way he treats stephin particular but it extends to the rest of the harem is so far into the rapey territory i cant help but be disgusted
anime,not_removed,cowboy bebop i gave it a so i dont actually dislike it but i do believe its severely overhyped for one there are a lot of episodes that are either middling or just straight up bad though i think a lot of people actually agree with that theyre just willing to forgive all the bad episodes and stamp a on it anyway my most controversial point would be that i think spikes backstory and storyline are trash julia is literally a mcguffin not a character but were supposed to understand spikes affection for her vicious is a caricature of an edgy shounen villain spike and viciouss relationship is never developed at all were just told that they had one and it was supposedly very deep which makes these confrontations very emotionally straining for spike though we have no real context for it no ones motivations are expressed well especially vicious again theres no real reason to have any emotional investment in the conflict aside from liking spike due to the other good episodes that werent part of his story line
anime,not_removed,i know people that hate bebop usually because its episodic in nature and they cant get behind a show that doesnt have a single main plot from start to finish
anime,not_removed,humanity has declined i want so badly to like this show but it just hasnt been working out for me i finished the first two episodes more than a year ago then got up to episode over the holidays and even knowing that there is only one miniarc left i just dont care enough to push through doesnt help that s everythings out of order so i know i wont be getting any sort of conclusion watashis personality is the main reason i was convinced to give the show a try but even that hasnt been as enjoyable to see as id hoped i was entertained by ys initial appearance and pions part ended up being unexpectedly emotional cant say theres much else i like other than assistantsan alternating between doing really random things and being surprisingly helpful
anime,not_removed,i dropped cowboy bepop around episodes in and i cant really remember how far i got i loved the style i loved the music i appreciated the dub but i hated spike i dont know how i was supposed to care for him at all he was just kind of there and really edgy without a palpable reason it might have happened after i dropped it but let me continue to why this was inexcusable episodic with bad episodes the short episode duration meant that the all that would happen was wed meet a badguy and theyd get taken down or occasionally redeemed the main characters didnt get a lot of time to develop in regards to the happenings around them speaking of which the rest of the main cast were incredibly tied to their characteristics you had the fatherlike character that supposedly had an equally dark backstory but it felt awfully cliche ed was really childish and just turned me off of the otherwise attemptingtobemature show faye seemed like pure fanservice to me with occasional chemistry with spike she rarely seemed to have much other purpose in the time i gave it was there an overarching story i think i saw a couple of episodes attempting to build up to one but i didnt feel invested in any of it
anime,not_removed,watching nhk right now and i have a few gripes first would be that it was a little too light hearted with the s suicide attempt how satou acted during that event made it hard to take it seriously especially with that at the end next is nanako yamazakis crush practically no time is spent with her so s her sudden reciprocal feelings are hard to buy when nothing happened after satou overheard her misaki is also lacking after episodes theres not a lot i know about her i hope theres more to come but shes only barely less of a mystery than at the beginning its still been very enjoyable but those stick out for sure
anime,not_removed,welcome to the nhk you can give it a higher rating if you skip the fillers basically follow the novel instead of the manga i read the novel and felt that the show shouldve restricted its cast to characters instead of trying to make a commentary on every troubled person in japan by adding those mediocre episodes
anime,not_removed,i think that the middle part of nhk was a little weaker and could have been left out that story about the marketing scheme and the neet brother of that woman and also the suicide trip was depicted as way too lighthearted to my taste especially the ending couldnt be taken serious
anime,not_removed,the art is bad still better than the vn art
anime,not_removed,i like higurashi but i can see people not liking it because of the wait until the second season for most questionsplot points to be answered also some folks just hate gore
anime,not_removed,too much focus on violence and gore rather than creating an oppressive atmosphere ie it lost all the subtlety that the source material had though this is only a complaint in contrast with the source i still enjoyed the show
anime,not_removed,i dont like gore idk its just really upsetting to me ive kind of come to terms with it though i mean whats more natural to enjoy watching people get brutally murdered or to not enjoy watching people get brutally murdered
anime,not_removed,second season spoiled all of the mystery not even halfway through and then resolved the conflict with home alone antics higurashi deserved a much better ending than it got also the two arcs involving the blonde chick and her uncle absolutely hated them
anime,not_removed,the fact that it got a season after is still infuriating
anime,not_removed,i dropped jojo at episode i cant put my finger on why but something about that specific flavor of gore really bothered me
anime,not_removed,i loved the story in hibike it made me wish id joined my high school band lol but i really really hated the yuribait im a lesbian so i think i take ff relationships in anime more seriously than most people but hibike had the most infuriating bait ive seen in a long time they spend so much time building this ultraintense dynamic between kumiko and reina only to not do anything with it at all they even gave reina an impossible love interest so theres chance shell end up with kumiko its cheap its lazy its condescending give them boyfriends let them just be friends i dont even care just stop patronizing your viewers like this
anime,not_removed,hibike euphonium ever since the second season i feel that show has been the subject of many debates due to the various gripes people had with it one aspect that sucks through out midori shes useless meaningless and doesnt deserve to be a part of the main four cause she does absolutely nothing in the series shes a waste of a character and all her screen time could be used on someone else who actually deserves it more
anime,not_removed,the only bad thing i can say about kon is that it didnt hook me in the first episode and i disliked the first episode so much that i wont listen to people who say yeah the show really starts after that but yeah i disliked it so much that i just cant
anime,not_removed,one punch man feels really contrived at times mostly from issues where it cant decide if it wants to be a gag manga or not and saitama gets painted as a humble messiah too much the random fishlip otaku after the fight with the sea king monster was really dumb hes literally just a random asshole in a crowd why is anyone listening to him instead of the guy who they saw save their life why is he so convinced saitama is a fake why is everyone else the story keeps contriving ways for saitama to be looked down on saitama just pulls a batmankirito just to show how cool he is but he never would have been able to do that if the entire crowd didnt decide to listen to a random fat fuck on the street
anime,not_removed,one punch man cannot do anything well in a serious vein it is the weakest point of the show imo all these videos on stuff like the sea king fightjust dont agree with the impact of then at all myself
anime,not_removed,takes a unique small scale conflict of two brothers trying to regain their bodies and somehow turns it into a gotta save the entire world from the bad guy generic plot they should have kept the scope of the story much smaller and personal
anime,not_removed,dumb and stubborn commanders and unneeded sol scenes both in the first season terraists
anime,not_removed,well thats easy i believe its fair to say that the janky af animation turned majority of people off within minutes yeah sure anyone who stayed is being rewarded but a large portion of those people wont ever be dissuaded by any deeper meaning to the plot
anime,not_removed,i mean i mostly enjoy it but i definitely get tired of the shounen formula at times training arcs can be really long young characters dont appeal to me as much power ups via being really passionate etc ill say hxh does it a lot better than the usual and york new was my absolute favorite i loved elements of chimera ant as well and kumugi probably wins the protect her smile award out of all anime for me but there were times i was just waiting for the next good part im well aware that im not best suited for the show since im not a huge fan of several of its genres i consider it a pretty big endorsement of the show that i like it in general i also could have done with an op that changed occassionally as much as i liked departure im sure i could nitpick other things but unless thats what you want to hear thats my answer
anime,not_removed,chimera ant arc ep some greed island episodes and of course alluka and pouf
anime,not_removed,its togashis stream of consciousness so there are some advantages and disadvantages to how the story was written it has an incredible sense of adventure to it but on the other hand there are some random story reveals that come out of left field such as the dark continent in the latest arc in the manga or even the existence of nen despite the fact nen battles are regularly broadcast on tv nen system is pretty cool for making superpowers but it has two problems one is that the powers have so much variety its hard to imagine them all interacting and it also has a shitload of rules about nen being invisible to people as well as techniques like in ten ren shu gyo that werent really necessary the exact functions of each category are a bit vague too with specialist being the ultimate fuck it it doesnt fit the normal rules but i still want to use this ability narutos elemental system is a lot more boring and i think was highly influenced by hxhs nen efficiency chart but even though cliche its simplicity made it obvious how powers interacted some arcs are better than others especially when it comes to villains the character designs on the heavens arena trio were pretty goofy and some of their powers are really fucking dumb nen rockets on a wheelchair spinning on a top because theyre obviously not important enough to get them genthru from greed island arc was pretty one dimensional
anime,not_removed,the world make no sense they hear about nen for the first time at some point and then it turns out everyone and their mother around then can use nen the progression of power is shit like the greedo islando makers are some sort of god apparently the show peaked for me at the yorknew city arc after that its all downhill
anime,not_removed,its pretty good for a shounen but it still has that shounen blandness at times it makes up for it by having better than average animation for shounens and quality characters with a decent plot it also suffers from prolonged bullshit explaining and filler episodes that arent really filler but mundane elongated scenes that could be cut and the story wouldnt change at all also at the chimera ant arc a lot of filler meaningless characters were introduced and it was wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too long for an arc it could have been condensed into of the episodes i actually skipped most of the chimera ant arc and dropped hxh for over a year because of how mundane most of it was i absolutely loved the yorknew arc though peak of the series
anime,not_removed,the anime wants to portraiy killua as an assassin that soften thanks to gon but dont see him kill people before his meeting with gon the show do a poor job of establishing strengh differences during the chimera ant arc pitou and meruem strengh are only described but never showned before their final fight yes she killed that guy would be nice if we could actually see the fight greed island is terrible even the beginning annouces that this arc is useless the pacing of the chimera ant arc is bad the narrator cant shut up the anime wants to portrait the chimera ants as morally grey after showing episodes of them laughing their asses off killing people all the training is basically the same deus ex alluka
anime,not_removed,i put the show on hold after episodes it was really kind of slow and didnt catch my interest much i know it gets better i just havent found the interest to start it again
anime,not_removed,for the beginning of hxh gon is the most irredeemably boring protagonist ive ever seen he is literally a disgusting grey goop of every single shonen protagonist ive ever seen minus anything that made others remotely unique right down to the obnoxious spiky hair then things like the chimera ant arc happen and he becomes more interesting
anime,not_removed,im still watching it so i cant talk about the whole show but the heavens arena arc really dissapointed me when i was told by a friend that the next arc was going to be a tournament arc i was very excited most of my dissapointment stems from it not living up to the dark tournemtn fro yuyuhakusho the only reason i compare them is because both manga were written by the same mangaka after that i would say the the episode a suprise victory from the same arc annoyed me more than the arc itself
anime,not_removed,chimera arc sucks insect dicks
anime,not_removed,i really disliked the show so dont hate me for this i got to the end of the yorknew arc before i had to stop watching the only character i remotely enjoyed watching for leorio every other character i found to be either unlikable or completely fail to get me to resonate with their narrative and struggles it went too far in the opposite direction to most shounen where death is usually a big deal and instead made it lose any semblance of reaction i love tournament arcs exam arcs i found myself bored through the hxhs first arc even more so during the shinobi gon fight which was tedious not only that but the rules to getting the hunter license as shown by said fight means people who are inept and undeserving are able to get the license it was a narrative device which didnt reflect as part of the world in a way that made it feel meaningful the show skips true training arcs and tries to replace them with elements which were both unsatisfying and logical stretches a few one handed press ups make you super powerful okay the heavens arena arc completely failed at presenting a logical skill increase as the floors increased getting to the point where floor was weak but was op this made no sense with the promotion and relegation system in place the power system was introduced poorly and i never really felt the weight of it within the world it was building contrast to say naruto were ninjitsu is fleshed out along with the characters from early on fights pretended to be clever and tactical yet all dissolved into sleight of hand which is just common battle tactics youll see in anything fight based even shows that dont slow to down to the show the details make use of that tactic on a consistent basis the narrator was both boring and annoying as fuck seriously i cant fucking stand narrators in long running shows the show would consistently build stuff up then fail to deliver on the payoff this can be an interesting method of messing with the viewers expectations mob psycho is a good example of it done well but the show wouldnt replace with any payoff at all just leave the threads hanging stagnant this meant an arc finishing never felt fulfilling in the way that it should the show was never written in a way that made me want to see the characters grow and evolve naruto shippuden was an exciting time because seeing the characters grow like that was something i looked forward to a more recent example though would be haikyuu where were only in the characters first year and im already questioning with friends what its going to be like when they are years the growth and evolution that is available through what has yet to be shown is a key aspect to being excited for the future and hxh failed to deliver that so thats my reasons for disliking hunter x hunter i still watch naruto and read fairy tail and im super excited for my hero academia season so its not like i just straight up dislike the shounen formula haikyuu currently sits in my top shows may actually be my favourite at the moment hunter x hunter just consistently failed to grab me and is probably the most bored ive been watching a well regarded shounen all opinions are subjective of course and id find it hard to really argue in detail about these points because its been a few years since i watched it and well ive drank since then
anime,not_removed,the chimera ant arc is one of the worst arcs in anime history the pacing lack of anything happening narration makes it incredibly boring almost killed my interest in the show
anime,not_removed,the show got worse after the initial tournament arc there are only a handful of somewhat interesting characters the entire show hisoka is done mostly well killua is entertaining at times but beyond that i feel like im reaching the yorknew arc had a bunch of villains that i cared about in no way whatsoever same with chimera power creep settles in over time and it gets extremely shouneny with all the shit like announcing your attack names the power of ren taking center stage over tactics and martial arts of any sort etc the character designs are absolutely positively awful the chimera ant arc is to date my single least favorite character design in any anime ive ever seen ants that look like catgirls shoujo antagonists with butterfly wings a tiger in a tanktop a penguinwhat no awful i also have a lot of spoilerific complaints but i think that suffices
anime,not_removed,most of the action is pretty mediocre certain moments such as s la pucelle and sister marys death dont really work because there either isnt enough time given to legitimately care about the characters or because the show is too toned down to make a shock value moment really work s changing la pucelles base face color to red when she is smacked into the wall doesnt have the effect they wanted of her being literally unidentifiable although it would be really hard to sell that anyways in addition characters arent fleshed out until their death episodes because sad death flags snow whitehardgore alices character dynamic is a ripoff of madokahomura fav is a cheap kyubey and the show wants to be so unbelievably edgy at points calamity mary and hardgore alices characters and ultimate fates in particular that its hard to take it seriously swim swim and ripple were the shows only real saving grace tbh
anime,not_removed,found this fairly underwhelming for several reasons firstly it immediately seems like a copy of madoka but juggles characters instead of and has none of shaft being well shaft secondly it kills characters off way too quickly for me to feel anything which kills any emotional connection i might have with the show thirdly i fucking hated calamity mary with a passion the va and the way she behaved etc i get shes meant to be an antagonist but i cant enjoy something when i hate someone that much the only good thing is the ed
anime,not_removed,it felt less like part one of a series and more like a novellength flashback in the middle of a series if i had been told at the beginning that s this was ripple and snow whites backstory id have actually really liked it because i would have known what the actual purpose was by the end it was clear it wasnt really a battle royale it wasnt really a mahou shoujo it wasnt really a thrillerit didnt really have much of a thematic core to it i guess i still liked it because it felt like a small part of a much bigger picture but man it was aimless
anime,not_removed,i think you replied the wrong place
anime,not_removed,i really enjoyed magi but one of the few complaints i had with it came down to s the conflict in the alibaba arc with the drama surrounding his friend just felt so odd and confusing i feel like his friend betrayed him like or times in the same arc but he either didnt notice or he didnt do anything about it so it really threw me off when trying to figure out his true motives then by the time we actually got to the conclusion of that arc their resolution didnt feel as impactful since i was never sure if i should hate or pity his friend and of course not enough sinbad but thats a given
anime,not_removed,s alibaba as a character was an asshat i couldnt get behind someone who was that dumb also the show is horribly paced seasons to get where they are was way too much one episode season should have been enough also alibabas dungeon was barely challenging at all and he seemed to have gotten through on pure luck this broke the mysticism of the dungeons
anime,not_removed,this is a very personal one and it really isnt a problem with the show per se but ive read the nights and my brain just cant switch off from going oo that bit is wrong and oh that character totally isnt like that same problem i have with disneys aladdin i always end up sad that they cut out the other genie and moved the setting from china to some weird arabiaindia hybrid again not really the shows fault or a real problem just a personal issue
anime,not_removed,there are a shit ton of problems honestly i havent watched it in over years so i cant recall right now but i do remember it had a lot of pacing characterization and plot issues
anime,not_removed,s i disliked the ending to season i get that the manga continues but it didnt feel like anything got resolved other than discriminatory dumbledores story you get to see basically everyones super ultimate attacks which basically did nothing regarding stopping the big bad hakuryus story got built up then abandoned half way and morginana basically disappeared which is a shame a lot of the build up to the finale was fantastic
anime,not_removed,im a big fan of magi and i think its a ton of fun but it really doesnt seem like it knows what it wants its target audience to be at times a lot of people are turned off the first few episodes because it seems like a kids show with its pretty childish art that ed that sounds like it was lifted from a nursery rhyme aladdin being how he is and all those were best friends themes which would all be fine if the show really was suitable for kids except its not not at all magi is one of those shows where i can excuse the fanservice but you cant deny that its there and its not family friendly it also has those really violent moments such as s hakuryuu randomly beheading a certain someone which also leads me to my second point jarring tone shifts i dont like magis humour much i found it too reliant on fanservice and having alibaba be the butt of every single joke which made it really hard to take him seriously when the show wanted me to but what distracted me most about magis humour is that it switched from funny to serious way too often at jarring times i didnt know whether i should laugh or take things seriously because i never knew where the show was heading next third criticism i found the introductory arc extremely boring i almost dropped the show after episodes since as i said it just felt like a kids show however i persisted and found one of my favourite shounens so im glad but i can see why many wouldnt be able to
anime,not_removed,loved magi but a few reasons i can think of really slow buildup the entire first season may as well be an introduction to lay down the various areas and world building the animation can be a bit iffy at times background characters often are drawn very simply which can lose some of the immersion not enough sinbad his scenes are easily the best imo
anime,not_removed,its slow really slow some people dont have the patience for it
anime,not_removed,to me its just boring not even the pacing just the subject dialogue setting everything about it just not my cup of tea
anime,not_removed,i thought the ending was portrayed a bit too melodramatic and felt kinda forced
anime,not_removed,the rando and sensui arcs were pretty weak thats really my only complaint
anime,not_removed,dragon ball z has so many faults its actually hard to iterate them but among the many id say its largest demerit is how it presents challenge when a villain is presented in dbz they are always overcome through the same simple method someone has to become stronger than them whether its unlocking a new form or unleashing your potential or training a lot it all comes down to making your power level go higher than your opponents new bad guy find a way to get stronger watch as the bad guy gets stronger get even stronger yourself wash rinse repeat kamehameha finale and frankly that kind of conflict is a large demerit to an otherwise interesting world
anime,not_removed,probably because it delivers the things that made the people who were interested in it watch it fighting good animation comedy i dont feel like it tries to be anything its not because its so ridiculous it can do anything it wants
anime,not_removed,possibly ppl going into it expected sth more shounenish since its named casshern and their dissapointment reflects the score
anime,not_removed,the fact that kyousuke rejected ayase ruined it for me joke i still love the show also the ending theres enough room for interpretation
anime,not_removed,the reason you loved higurashi is the exact reason i hated it lol im kind of a wuss and i just really hate horror anime i couldnt make it past the opening scene
anime,not_removed,i gave up on shinsekai yori after episodes so i cant say im fully qualified to criticise it as a whole but i nonetheless didnt enjoy what i saw i felt like the show left me in the dark the setting wasnt really established well enough to fully understand the weight of things that were going on the characters felt like plot devices more so than characters which isnt inherently a bad thing i love madoka magica but i it didnt work for me in this case it just felt like the show was trying to make me worried or swerve my expectations without actually establishing any intrigue i also didnt really believe that the characters would actually be friends with each other the chemistry was off which is one of my pet peeves thats all i can remember of the top of my head its been a while since i watched it
anime,not_removed,i mean fmab doesnt have the amazing tone and suspense of the version and it starts really abruptly with the assumption that people have seen im also not a huge fan of may and the panda or even just the forcedfeeling inclusion of eastern alchemy
anime,not_removed,im also interested in why someone wouldnt like one punch man if comedy doesnt click for you everything about it falls apart i didnt found it comedic at all therefore whole show from my point of view is just extremely pretentious void of nothing its not even boring its just nothing not fun not sad not cringey not stupid just not i like nina from cg more than anyone in opm except tatsumaki i guess because at least she made me angry and animation is not something that can fix such empty show
anime,not_removed,fullmetal alchemist brotherhood super obvious directing relies on having seen fma for a lot of characterisation very rushed first couple of episodes scars character arc could have been a lot better comedy is bad though that is very subjective briggs arc was a tad too long
anime,not_removed,gintama comedy is hit and miss serious arcs in the beginning have no tension if a character were to die it would only be one that had just been introduced prior the arcs later in the series are all close together and it loses the whole thing that gintama does well comedy also lost a chunk of its cast that made for a greater variety too many characters that arent very likeable especially females being severely violent being played off as a humour with no repercussions all the violence from a tsundere without the tsun or dere
anime,not_removed,fma has really bad comedic timing
anime,not_removed,inappropriately timed comedy mannequin legion was a cheap plot device with no payoff
anime,not_removed,the comedy in one punch man never made me laugh out loud the best laugh i got was in the second episode s when genos is explaining his back story and saitama is losing his patience otherwise i thought the action scenes were great but the show lacks any tension in fight scenes since we already know saitama is op as fuck in terms of story and writing i prefer ones other work mob psycho over one punch man i feel the characters in mob are more relatable the way the show dealt with both talent and selfimprovement i found to be gripping though both are well animated i felt the experimentation in mob was far more out there and entertaining and lastly even though some jokes in mob didnt hit reigens character overall was a complete hit for me
anime,not_removed,fmab having an ending where s every significant tragedy is literally fixed with magic and then everyone lives happily ever after complete with marriages and kids except for the villains and a few heroic badasses who went down in blazes of mighty glory was a laaaaaaaame change from earlier in the show when bad things were allowed to happen to innocent people that also being the aftermath of a bloody civil warmilitary coup makes it more ridiculous never mind the role a god played in everything also the romance was weak i need more than just one spontaneous look of attraction before characters decide theyre both madly in love with each other bleh
anime,not_removed,gintama certain character redemptions and a huge range in quality from episode to episode
anime,not_removed,fmab is generic shonen all the way through the end i thought most of its characters were pretty weak and a lot of them shared literally the exact same personality alphonse and may are bad characters by any anime standards alphonse was interesting for all of about one episode and almost feels like a throw in so ed can look more interesting next to him the way the plot develops is overly convoluted and not involved as in it makes previous arcs irrelevant and introduces characters when convenient and not in a way that makes sense which is a common complaint i have towards shonens that follow a single narrative lots of cheap plot devices the finale leading up to the final fight was really cheesy i feel like all people remember is the monologue at the end which is silly because the rest of the ending isnt very good the character motivations and actions were shoehorned to fit the plot and were not logical some of the emotional scenes got tiresome and forced the comedy was terrible it had plenty of solid moments but does not deserve a by any means more like a im biased though because i think shonens in general arent very good when they run longer than a episode season or
anime,not_removed,fullmetal alchemist brotherhood i havent seen all of fmab yet but a few complaints poor comedic timing mostly subjective but nonetheless some parts are kind of weird first several episodes have weird pacing and lack of detail the show basically assumes youve seen fma which may work very well under that assumption but by itself makes it unpolished its a very safe narrative i feel like the story sacrificed some narrative potential for the sake of having broad appeal it does everything very well and has no glaring flaws and because of this its hyper popular but it comes at somewhat of a cost of storytelling integrity imo as the narrative doesnt do anything adventurous for all intents and purposes its just a shounen albeit a refined and well written one
anime,not_removed,one punch man worked well as a comedy did not work for me at all as an action series very hard for it to have any tension or excitement with the entire premise of saitama that was fine when it stuck to being a parody but it played it straight far too much
anime,not_removed,brotherhood the main characters of the show get effectively sidelined while the giant cast of badass adults do the heavy lifting until the climax of the final shounen showdown where after daddy has effectively saved the world the kids get the final moment of glory cause shounen i could say allot about brotherhood but the reality is unlike brotherhood is just a big shounen romp
anime,not_removed,fmab did not develop many of the characters as well as the version i feel sometimes as though they relied on people having watched that one first
anime,not_removed,it hits all the sports tropes but its well done and the humor makes you forget about it summer camp power of friendship struggle to accept defeat struggle to accept new team members as in overcome their difference and work together its nothing new or special buit still highly likeable because its done so well
anime,not_removed,theres a lot more i could say about rezero but i hope for now this is plenty
anime,not_removed,children
anime,not_removed,even as a big fan of mob psycho the show does start off kind of slow so i can understand it
anime,not_removed,it was really hard for me to get past the first two episodes because i really wasnt a fan of the comedy up to that point the rest of the series was really different and in my opinion vastly superior when compared to the first two episodes i would also like to add that i do realise the importance of the firs two episodes as a means to establishing the universe and series premise they just aint my cup of tea
anime,not_removed,wished reigen death excuse me
anime,not_removed,i think reigen is a really likable person yeah he manipulated mob and his clients but at the end of the day most of his client leave satisfied with the physical service he can provide like spiritual massages despite tricking mob to work for him for almost no money he imparts him with very important life lessons that shaped mob into such a good guy he served as a pseudo father figure to mob i also think ritsu mobs brother has very valid justification for s feigning affectionrespect for mob he has an inferiority complex because hes jealous of mobs godly power and at the same time afraid of it it seemed pretty reasonable since he expected to have psychic powers as well but never got them to surface wout dimples interference by that point he already built up resentment for mob but the issue was resolved near the end the weight behind fights isnt supposed to come from who wins because we know hes almost untouchable the weight comes from what the fights mean to mob refusing to fight back because hurting people is wrong or hurting someone with potentially deadly force to stop them from hurting someone mob duels with those ideas a lot and thats where most of the weight came from for me
anime,not_removed,how is reigen a terrible person while he scams people he still gives a service and makes his customers happy not to mention s he was willing to die for mob to not fight and tried to talk shit to the claws leader even after knowing it was a esper
anime,not_removed,whether or not it should be done you may want to spoiler tag that
anime,not_removed,i see where youre coming from but disagree fundamentally on this point in particular i know the characters in nge are meant to be awful unlikable people i at least like almost every character in nge even fairly unimportant characters are given little quirks that make them seem so much more human than most shows seem to bother with obviously they are deeply flawed people but that doesnt mean i dislike them i just feel sorry for them most of the time or if im in a particularly bad mood feel sorry for myself through them this wont apply to everyone but i cant say i hate the characters of nge when they just act like flawed wronged human beings and when sometimes i find the difficulties they face highly relateable
anime,not_removed,the funny thing is i was really depressed at the time of watching evangelion but i found solace in the show every character was so human and relatable now im a huge fan of the series i feel the same way about flcl
anime,not_removed,i think that was kind of the point s gendo is so distraught over losing his wife to the evangelion experiment that he decided to mass clone his wife as pilots for the now giantsized wife whose original personality is forever lost meanwhile he uses his wife as a major trump card versus the conspiracy of seele instead of abiding by their plan to completely absorb the entire humanity into a single life organism he allows the evangelion unit as the final stand in humanitys right to self determination and self expression gendo used his grief as a final weapon against the conspiracies while also using his power to grant his wifes final wish of a better future and a future for their son shinji in a way gendos desperate and intense despair over his loved ones is reflected more overtly in shinji instead of outwardly expressing it gendo decided to brood quietly and plan the ultimate act of rebellion the best way he could its an insane plan but it does make sense from his perspective
anime,not_removed,i was and am convinced that gendo has aspergers his profile and actions fit it to a t average above average or vastly above average iq which would explain how gendo got as high as he did a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others everyone knows gendo is a prick and he doesnt seem to have friends or even many allies a lack of social or emotional reciprocity gendo acts like this to shinji and even to his decadesold comrade fuyutski he to a large extent is even like this to people like s ritsuko he utterly and completely fails to keep her loyal and maintain even the illusion of emotional warmth towards her despite his final words to her being i needed you they approach others even if awkwardly ahem ahem gendo the pimp queen for example a person with as may engage in a onesided longwinded speech about a favorite topic while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listeners feelings or reactions fucking gendo makes the speeches doesnt get others where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other peoples emotions however they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid reallife situations people with as may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines and apply these rules in awkward ways such as forced eye contact resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive gendos gendo stare also fuyutuski goes into this in detail a lack of interest in fiction and a positive preference towards nonfiction gendo aint no arts major pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of the most striking possible features of as fuyutuski tells again about how focussed gendo is on his research
anime,not_removed,characterization is phenomenal despite that the writing is atrocious ok at the risk of oversimplifying evangelion isnt the majority of the writing characterization eva is a character study after all do you mean that the external mechaseeleangelru plotline was poorly written
anime,not_removed,my lazy attempts at rebuking lack of character development is not an inherent negative to boot theres actually enough enough characterization to make up for the lack of development shinji does actually grow as a character though it literally only happens in the last episode which is literally cheating and should almost not count imo too many fans focus far too much on evangelions actual plot i think its almost completely pointless trying to make complete sense of the plot since that definitely wasnt the primary objective of the series the plot was merely a platform to nudge character traits and show them in varying situations and for the last spoiler tag imo its pretty obvious thats basically what happened at the end of of the series and before eoe came out
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,s yui being cloned and the soul in unit are major spoilers tag those man

anime,not_removed,it all comes down to the severe lack of exposition im of two minds on it because it arguably presents a major element of mystery to the show that a lot of fans enjoy discussing and speculating over though i can understand the frustration of those who want a more specific answer to the lore and the storyline as well
anime,not_removed,it all comes down to the severe lack of exposition yeah animes these days have long scenes of characters sitting around explaining everything for the viewer maybe eva goes a little too far in the opposite direction but i still find it vastly preferable
anime,not_removed,it all comes down to the severe lack of exposition which evangelion no doubt suffers from oddly enough i felt that evangelion where people usually complain about tended to do a good job of providing sufficient explanation what people seem to complain about is where the angelru are coming from what the angelru are what the fruit of life are etc etc i figured that was all fairly obviously or explicitly acknowledged through dialogue and exposition s i dunno why i dont see people complain more about seele because that was the biggest hole in the exposition we literally never find out the difference between seele impact and gendo impact
anime,not_removed,i find this hilarious because i dont like the ending but for exactly opposite reasons i felt that if anything it was too simple s shinji starts instrumentality everyone is made to face their emotional problems once they do that instrumentality merges them shinjis okay with it for some reason along the way a basic lecture on basic existentialist philosophical problems is given along with an abridged standard first year textbook solution to them two episodes basically summed up there
anime,not_removed,my only issue with madoka is that the character development and exploration wasnt really made as much of a priority as i would have liked it was the one thing that stopped it from being a for me
anime,not_removed,i understand this theres meta reasons for the uselessness of madokas character but i can still understand disliking the characters especially sayaka i thought she was a bit annoying and i adore almost everything about the series
anime,not_removed,theres a meta reason for the uselessness of madokas character that outlines homuras condition and adds context to her actions in rebellion but she is still a bad character nonetheless other than that it just seems like its not your type of anime i respect that as for shoehorned darkness in a magical girl i thought madoka was fine but if you want to see shit that does this to the nth degree check out magical girl raising project its comically worse at forcing darkness its pretty bad and is obviously just being edgy for edgysake
anime,not_removed,many people who dislike the pacing liked the recap movies exponentially more i suggest maybe trying those sometime why wouldnt she want to save mami or the blue haired girl as well if she really cared about madoka then she wouldve tried to save them too this stems from a misinterpretation of homura and a fairly common one at that homura is not trying to save her friends shes trying to keep madoka shes infatuated and slightly psychotic shed have to be to continue this time loop for the equivalent of about yearsthis is cannon and this is explored much more deeply in rebellion madoka magica is about homuras condition along with the consequences of the cycle as for the other magical girls and their motivation s mami is just as messed up as the others for selfishly leading madoka and sayaka into believing being a magical girl is a righteous thing just to have people to share the burden with her misleading idolization lead sayaka to her own death in an attempt to do the right thing which doesnt matter in the end because as a witch the lost magical who sacrificed herself for hope in righteous acts just wreaks despair s although kyoko doesnt really do much more for the anime than add some slightly needed conflict in the middle she also serves as a cautionary tale as to what selfishly selfless wishes will become and also as the image of a magical girl who has learned the balancing cycle and doesnt attempt to do the right thing just what needs to be done for her to survive while minimizing the casualties
anime,not_removed,i felt the exact opposite couldnt get invested into yuyuyu at all seemed lightish
anime,not_removed,i would recommend watching the two recap movies if you ever feel inclined people say they fixed the pacing for those who felt it had pacing issues
anime,not_removed,i thought the original series was pretty much as perfect as a subjective thing can be considered i thought the pacing was great along with the reveals but i have heard from many that the pacing was bad and the movies fixed it so i just propagate that to meet the pacing complaint i liked the series better but the movies are amazing as well
anime,not_removed,are you sure youre talking about the same movie im pretty sure op referred to the first movies where the first one liberally cuts content out that may have slowed the pacing of the original series down by too much for some people however you seem to be talking about the one rebellion which is a completely different beast
anime,not_removed,i dont mean rebellion fixed the pace i mean the recap movies hajimari and eien i love rewatching madoka because theres so much to discover theres things i ashamedly missed on my first watch through like s madokami destroying her own witch along with other things that just went over my younger head the first time i disliked rebellion at first too but i love it now after watching it again and really thinking about it it really adds context to homura and her actions in the series if you watch it all again with the idea she was always like this then maybe it will change your perception of it the common interpretation is homura was always this slightly psychotic and infatuated girl youd have to be to repeat the timeline to an equivalent about yearsthis is cannon and wasnt trying to save madoka to be selfless to a dear friend but was actually acting in her own selfish desires and thats why she was so hurt when she saved madoka but couldnt be with her
anime,not_removed,magical girl show for bronies what aside from edgy stuff like rainbow factory bronies watch a cartoon for little girls with almost no conflict madoka is like the polar opposite of that
anime,not_removed,practice makes perfect was absolutely not at all the theme of the show s think of sakumas story he wanted it more than anybody and practiced harder than anybody but he didnt have the talent and so he was mercilessly destroyed the moral of ping pong is that you shouldnt just play because you want to always win and be the best in the world you should play because you love the game at the end of the story all of the main characters are in different places with different relations to the game and theyve all found a level at which they can have ping pong in their lives and be happy about it s peco and china who both have the drive and talent to be the best are on the olympic team but theyve learned that playing is its own reward and they arent salty fucks about the possibility of losing kazama played at the top level for a while but doesnt really have the same passion and love for the game that the other two do so he made his peace with the sport and stepped down smile only ever competed because he was friends with peco he doesnt have any interest in playing at the top level even though he totally could so hes perfectly happy teaching the game to kids and sakuma has reconciled himself with the fact that his talent doesnt measure up to his ambition and has moved on and found happiness in something that doesnt involve ping pong at all
anime,not_removed,i strongly agree but damn i still love the rest of the show
anime,not_removed,there is no point to the theme how i see it its just a story of two friends who play ping pong and the events that occur are simply the coming of age aspect to it
anime,not_removed,fixtion is usually more enjpoyable when not realisticpretty sure of the viewers wanted peco to winfriendshipcouragewillpower and never giveup attitude are always overplayed in anime esp shounen who make the majority of the mediumi can agree with ur point but it would surprise me if an anime fan of all ppl complained about it
anime,not_removed,felt like the point was for him to be unbelievable and make it clear at the end that there were two main characters all along i liked that part because it was a surprise but still made sense in the shows themes also giving smile his more unique arc too
anime,not_removed,the unreliable narrator excuse is definitely one of the things i dislike about the show because an excuse is exactly what it is outside of hitagi end there is just no other reason for it if you removed it entirely from every other arc the only things that would really change are the amount of fanservice and how much of a creep araragi is to his sisters both improvements if you ask me
anime,not_removed,i feel exactly the same way but i can never say so on ranime except in threads like these because ill get downvoted to hell and have shit taste i dont like any of shafts shows but ranime forbid i express my opinion
anime,not_removed,i lost track of how many times i had to rewind to catch all the dialogue or read the random title cards ariagi said so much that after a while i was just looking at words on a screen instead of reading them other characters dialogue were easier to follow the first one i saw was the one released a few years ago not knowing it was a continuation as a stand alone i dont think it had issues and i liked oogie who was female in this arc
anime,not_removed,people liking things a lot annoys me okay buddy
anime,not_removed,the plot of monogatari is actually kinda meh but its one of my favorites for its avant garde shaft style and nisios writing which is geniusie his wordplay etc
anime,not_removed,ahhh i totally get you kind of like a vanilla almost disney way of portraying the struggles of being a a single mom i can totally see that
anime,not_removed,i wanted to go with showsmovies i hadnt seen much criticism for and disappearance was one of the top ones that came to mind all of those seem more than fair really interesting point on wolf children and the investment in a show about kids because its a good point that i never really thought of thanks
anime,not_removed,if you dont like kids you wont like a movie focused on the raising of kids especially given how well it portrays those kids at being kids bit of a generalisation there im probably fall under the militant side of childfree but i love wolf children you dont need to like real children to enjoy a good piece of fiction about them
anime,not_removed,there is the fact that they are part wolf so they probably grow up quicker as a counterbalance but still i believe this is actually confirmed in the film
anime,not_removed,thats a fair complaint if it breaks your immersion
anime,not_removed,thanks for sharing your thoughts guess its not a show for everyone
anime,not_removed,i mean these complaints were for eps and there will be akko is starting to get her shit straight since episode lets just wait if its to validate these complaints
anime,not_removed,i think as a show the serious geniusmastermind aspect of the story does clash kind of hard with the comedy and the hammy fun of the next insane impossible situation lelouch gets out of i thoroughly enjoyed it but i can totally see why that aspect gets in the way of the logic and ingenuity of some of the scenes
anime,not_removed,the main reason i was so hyped the first half is because the buildup was really solid the feeling of unease and mystery only grew episode by episode and they pulled that off perfectly thats the reason why i ended up really disliking it i was so disappointed with almost everything in the second half i also personally thought all characters were pretty weak
anime,not_removed,i liked but yeah i hear this fairly often and i did enjoy the first two seasons more
anime,not_removed,definitely a valid complaint its one i disagree with but definitely makes sense to me
anime,not_removed,s it is revaled if i remember correct that her father is associated with the team that know about lain true nature thus makes sense to provide her with any equipment she needs

anime,not_removed,how can anyone hate moe
anime,not_removed,flip flappers can get uncomfortable with how it sexualizes its characters this a couple bad fanservice scenes dropped the series a rank for me just on its own i cant fully enjoy a show if i dont feel comfortable watching its character portrayals im all for themes of sexual comingofage or romance but theres a difference between that and obvious pandering in a show that was so ambitious and original it makes me really sad they decided to do that whether they wanted to or felt they had to to get attention
anime,not_removed,many people who like flip flappers myself included were attracted to it originally because in a lot of ways it reminded them of shows like flcl that is series with dense philosophical and psychological themes that are cloaked in random settings and humor and that type of show definitely isnt for everyone so i totally get it when i recommend it to people and it turns out its not their thing
anime,not_removed,yeah i would probably really like the show if i had watched it as a yo
anime,not_removed,and the stuff that happened in the last two episodes was super dumb s nomu was created to be just as strong as all might all might due to his injury is actually weaker than the villains thought he was this ostensibly means that nomu is actually stronger than all might all might beats nomu anyways not by outsmarting him or anything but because he tried so hard that it made him stronger thats like shonen bullshit right there
anime,not_removed,its got a decent length run and jumping right into the action would change the story entirely
anime,not_removed,thats basically what this arc is the few new characters added help flesh out the different aspects of the academy and introduce a best girl contender while fleshing out key characters if you want to make comparisons think of todoroki like neji bakugo like sasuke ochaka as hinata and so on it introduces new characters but they are to service the greater world building of the show also those comparisons have no bearing on the outcome of the tournament so they arent spoilers
anime,not_removed,theres a lot of it and season will definitely cover part of it
anime,not_removed,one of the things i love about toradora is how it takes common tropes and constructs a believable defense of their actions and character they move beyond being mere cookiecutter archetypes while also showing how such a character might be formed by their past and surroundings i could see how they might feel exaggerated and the mixing of heavy drama and comedy probably contributes to that as far as tatami goes is there any thing in particular you were hoping it would accomplish
anime,not_removed,well s the show ended right when a romance was about to bloom so it didnt exactly have a followthrough in a baseballswing terminology
anime,not_removed,if you didnt enjoy the characters i probably cant convince you to rewatch the show but in s you realise that a lot of how ozu is portrayed is warped from the mcs blameassigning perspective a lot of the bad or questionable things he did were all in pursuit of his own goal and love for the daughter of that pharma company and just out of curiosity have you had any sort of college experience like this obviously a lot of what the main character is like is very contextspecific but i identified with a lot of the more general struggles anxieties and dreams and akashi happens to be my favorite character in anime so even though i dont know that i identify with her i definitely think shes perfect thanks for sharing
anime,not_removed,s i dont feel like the show ever advocates redoing life its merely the narrative lens if anything the show wants you to take the opportunities in front of you rather than trying to fit in or living in a fantasy i can respect disliking the repetition especially if you didnt find it purposeful or comedic id heavily argue that the show is very original about a whole bunch of things and that the artstyle while not animation amazingly is very useful and beautiful i dont think ozu is meant to be an antagonist either really
anime,not_removed,s rejection of reality is a theme of the anime but its glorified
anime,not_removed,s to be fair for the redo your life escapism element that was kind of the point of the series in that one cant desperately run from life or try to change just for changes sakes recklessly
anime,not_removed,hmmm ozus not my favorite but id disagree that hes not redeemable he actually has a lot going for him but we tend to fall in line with the protags point of view and miss it as for the s resetting while i can definitely see how you would dislike the lack of responsibility i have the perspective that hes not conscious of these various permutations so hes not really learning just living a bunch of different possibilities until he gets it right and i think plenty of his failures come back to haunt him even in individual episodes honestly i dont think theres a single episode aside from the end where hes actually happy so that didnt bother me i suppose you can say that didnt matter in the end and id definitely understand the frustration of that but i enjoy them mostly for what they are individually rather than based on their continuity or lack of it i guess the time rewind is lazy in a way but it would be more so if it was a deus ex machina rather than the entire plan for the show
anime,not_removed,whats your perspective on different art in other series stuff like ping pong mob psycho lain etc was it just ttgs art that rubbed you the wrong way or do you simply prefer the standard anime visual fare
anime,not_removed,how exactly should geniuses act then i mean i can think of at least genius characters who act completely differently to each other
anime,not_removed,not saying i dont agree with you just wanting to bring up the point that having a high iq doesnt mean you cant act dumb especially in a casual context
anime,not_removed,i felt the exact opposite that you did about most of it a majority of the games presented sora and shiro with a severe disadvantage and they set up multiple situations where victory looked bleak such as s during the shooting game when shiro the teams ace was mind controlled and sora was desperately running for his life when i as a viewer was uncertain how they would achieve victory that gave tension and meaning to the games now if you watch from a cynical point of view where you think theyre the mcs they are going to win anyways that would sap all the tension away though that can be applied to of most anime just because they are geniuses all personality shouldnt be removed they would get serious when they wanted to and would have fun when they wanted to there were also differences between their personalities based on their expertise with sora being a smug manipulative people reader and shiro as an emotionless cold hard logical computer like intellect
anime,not_removed,concerning your paragraph i felt like they didnt have enough timeeps to tell the full background story and kinda rushed the last episodes
anime,not_removed,dont want to spoil anything but the last episodes take place before the rest of the series and portray watashis past from a very different light i was honestly surprised when i saw them give it a chance sometime
anime,not_removed,the episodic nature is what brought bebop down for me as well some of the episodes were amazing but the majority were either lackluster or forgettable without an overarching plot i feel like they were counting more on kannos soundtrack to carry the show than anything else
anime,not_removed,the updated art in the anime style is not bad
anime,not_removed,i dont know if this is something that gets circlejerked a lot or not it just seems like something that would but i actually think the vn art is really good like its not good in a technical aspect and those hands are something only a mother could love but is very good at conveying emotion through facial expressions even more so i believe than the updated art does the only thing i think the updated art does better is the scary expressions also look me in the eyes and tell me rika isnt adorable in the original art style
anime,not_removed,you can really see the difference in the openings of the anime vs the first chapter the anime shows s keiichi killing rena and mion with satoshis bat where as onikakushihen starts with s a foreshadowing to rena standing in the rain apologizing it really does focus heavily on the gore and shock from it i agree
anime,not_removed,no one hates the first episodes of jojo more than jojo fans do
anime,not_removed,it was the styling which got me its too much like overlydrawn american comics
anime,not_removed,the dynamic between reina and kumiko was some pretty egregious bait indeed i definitely expected the plot to go in a very different direction at times
anime,not_removed,im a lesbian too and while i would agree theres a certain yuri gaze to hibikes directing i dont think that it was supposed to be shown reina was interested in her my perspective on the show is that most of the supposedromantic scenes only appear that way because kumiko is a closeted lesbian everyone else in the show shows clear interest in the opposite sex besides kumiko who lusts after other girls at like every moment
anime,not_removed,i honestly dont get this criticism of the show i mean i do but i feel is totally missing the point of the show i personally never felt like the show was yuri baiting and im a huge yuri fanto me it fetl like a very close friendship that could potentially turn in to a romantic relationship but never didnor it needed to in my highschool girls do things like in the show all the time and are not gay some of them do things that if they showed in anime would make people lose their shit over yuribait im honestly not the best person to explain the appeal of the show but seeing it and walking away thinking that the show spend so much time building this ultraintense dynamic between kumiko and reina only to not do anything with it at all is in my view ludicrous dont get me wrong im not saying is an invalid criticism just one that i very strongly disagree with and think is very unfair to the masterfull character writing of the show
anime,not_removed,midori is the one who gets kumiko to join the band and has an arc showing her self destructiveness and is consistently shown throughout the series to always be internally fighting with herself this is an element that plays out when she pushes hazuki to rejection and as a character trait is shown with her love of cute things but her dislike of being cute as she constantly fights her ideals on how she perceives cute her constant stopping for cute toys and that isnt just for the sake of narrative fluff now as to her role in the overall narrartive well that was pretty much taken away when the creators decided to not got the source ending as everything that leads up to that ending would of been because of midori from the initial pushing of hazuki to the explanation of the flower to just being the general cupid of the show she would of been the instigator and puppetmaster throughout the narrative and even with how it ended she still is its just not as poignant because we dont see the truly satisfying ending point as the anime began to write itself into the corner
anime,not_removed,i agree for the most part i love opm but it has its faults on your second point though i feel like thats just a case of mobherd mentality i mean you have a bunch of people shaking with fear and theyre corralled into a small space at the mercy of a monstrous fish it really only takes or assholes to warp a mobs groupthink and considering saitama isnt really one of them in this situation its kind of believable that theyd turn against him
anime,not_removed,its not just a combination of all the common tropes in the medium tho it subverts many of the popular shounen formulas but youve seen eps so and barely remember them so we
anime,not_removed,seriously everytime i watch it i always thinking why im watching this show then the ending clip appear ok thats why
anime,not_removed,i think the interesting thing about hxh is that it both adheres to shonen formulas but sometimes deviates from them wildly as well s that killua can kill so readily for his friend is already pretty crazy by shonen standards where characters usually dont go as far as killing for the sake of their friends so early in the story meanwhile the show trying to take new angles at every conventions sometimes means we get deprived of a few things s such as meruem being taken down by unconventional means rather than his power being directly overcome by a heros battle ability some fans are still wondering how the protagonists could have beaten meruem combatwise
anime,not_removed,pretty much the only arc in the entire series that felt perfectly paced was hunters exam arc but trick tower scaredmio
anime,not_removed,problem kurapika and leorio dont have enough screen time warning im only on episode so i could be jumping the gun couldnt agree more with you with this one after the hunters exam arc i was so into kurapikas story line but it kinda draged in and after i finished his arc i didnt feel really satisfied with his resolve of kinda giving s killing the spider after taking away the leaders nen that and why he didnt release those eyes the boss got was fake i get that he was under a lot of emotion stress but i felt like after he found out about the spider dead bodies being faked he would have maybe checked the eyes to see if they were faked problem i never really got how killua didnt know about it when he was being train to be s and is suppose to become the head of the family
anime,not_removed,s nen s its clearly a secret everyone has it because look where they are after they know about it essentially a war against the phantom troupe greed island and in expeditions to chimera ant controlled territory those are not places where you would expect to find a normal person iirc never in the series is nen mentioned in the presence of a person who cant use it or isnt in training in fact if you watch one of the few places where we see a large gathering of people unaware of nen the greed island auction theyre very careful about never mentioning nen its just a mysterious power
anime,not_removed,kurapika and leorio dont have enough screen time leorio ok but kurapika has a full arc dedicted to him oo problem yep one of my problems with the show problem s its not a secret most people in the hunter exam just didnt know about it because they hadnt passed give him the benefit of the doubt though because i cant be certain if he had or hadnt planned nen yet yes he had s we see both netero and illumi use it in the hunter exam
anime,not_removed,the narrator said hes still this was an adaptation mistake he is actually kurapika and leorio dont have enough screen time yes problem agreed problem jesus i didnt need to remember him now
anime,not_removed,chimera ant arc ep u wot some greed island episodes my only problem with greed island is s the people who made the game are fucking omnipotent apparently and of course alluka and pouf i really liked aluka as a character and to see he was actually a family member killua cared for was always cool just s deus ex machina was my problem with it and pouf was just fucking annoying
anime,not_removed,spoiler tags dude point s because their enemies are hunters the genei ryodan and the chimera ants who swallowed nen using hunters i dont see whats the problem here point s the power progression isnt shit at all in fact its pretty good but yeah the game makers thing is bullshit
anime,not_removed,im curious who these meaningless filler characters are not trying to bash you im just genuinely curious
anime,not_removed,go back you wont be disappointed saying it starts slow is probably the only legitimate gripe i have with the show its a masterpiece
anime,not_removed,really i thought it was perfect even in the chimera ants arc where people seem to have the biggest problem with pacing i thought it was perfect wouldnt really work if it was different
anime,not_removed,tfw when its the best hxh arc
anime,not_removed,i can totally understand the ca arc not being someones cup of tea and the narration and slow pace getting annoying but it seems a bit ridiculous to say its one of the worst arcs in anime history especially considering the stuff that actually does happen when the story picks up
anime,not_removed,i certainly didnt like it as much as some people but i find it hard to argue that it didnt do anything well i absolutely loved a few aspects of it
anime,not_removed,the pacing i can see how that is a problem for some but it was perfect for me i dont think it could have worked as well otherwise lack of anything happening this makes me think you havent even watched it narration i dont see the problem
anime,not_removed,the sad death flags was a somewhat bad call on the animation studios when episode aired i immediately jumped in the ln because an edgy madoka ripoff is what i always wanted in the ln you have no death flags the character backstories are told at volume which is like way later thats when they get their proper backstories
anime,not_removed,definitely agree with you on most of your points i wouldnt call parts of it a ripoff of madoka since the ln was published shortly after madoka came out iirc but your points on the characterization and shock value are really right on if i could add a couple to it id say that the pacing was really weird s like how they showed us this scene of gore and death in the first seconds but later on act as if the first character death was supposed to be a major shock and that the ending was really anti climatic and wrapped up the reason on a really unsatisfying inconclusive emotionless note clearly trying to leave it open for a second season but it ended up ruining what could have been a strong ending for a generally mediocre show
anime,not_removed,the only good thing is the ed that ed was bomb one of the best of the season for sure
anime,not_removed,the plot has almost nothing to do with madoka besides magical girls if its a rip off of anything its dangan ronpa i thought they didnt start killing them fast enough but maybe thats just me i hate when people think a villan has to be lovable it hurts me when i cant pick a side because it feels like everyones killing eachother for no reason fuck you the op is great
anime,not_removed,yup sure did lol
anime,not_removed,yeah the cassim arc was definitely a bit weird for that i heard it was done a lot better in the manga and ive been considering picking that up recently since i like the series not enough sinbad
anime,not_removed,i agree i saw a lot of potential in the show but this arc really put me off i didnt really like the boob gags either and morgiana was a frustrating character
anime,not_removed,for the last point he did have a magi with him and a djinn which probably made it a lot easier
anime,not_removed,pacing of the anime is slow it adapted like chapters in those two seasons now that probably just means you think the pacing of the entire series is slow then lol
anime,not_removed,thats a matter of taste i was looking for a legit reason
anime,not_removed,felt the same away that part could have been handled better
anime,not_removed,you forgot it takes three episodes for anything of value to happen the pacing was absolute shit
anime,not_removed,i think training and reaching new limits is a good realistic way to overcome an enemy but yeah it never changed what i really thought it could have used is strategy or obstacles that cant be overcome through training and power ups goku when he gets killed by hit i thought was a good use of goku actually using his brain and intuition even if it was a bit of an ass pull
anime,not_removed,the introduction of alchehestry felt so out of place i dont even know what that was
anime,not_removed,haha its interesting to see someones elses viewpoint well i disagree it was one of my first anime and i loved it it was funny the characters were good its was fun hyped show and all around i thought it was a great experience just wondering how far did you get into it
anime,not_removed,if someone doesnt like saitama as a character and doesnt understand that hes subverting the trope of shonen shows then hes probably the worst character ever this happened to a friend of mine who hasnt watched enough anime to understand this and he hated the show i guess its also irritating that other heroes have such a tough time when you know saitama could just solve it in a single punch for me the show was a hitandmiss type i liked it enough but id never rewatch it except for the fight scenes
anime,not_removed,very rushed first couple of episodes when i first gave fmab a try that first episode stopped me from continuing it for months as someone who hadnt seen the one it really turned me off im glad i was able to pick it back up eventually but im still not a big fan of the first three or so episodes
anime,not_removed,relies on having seen fma for a lot of characterisation maybe thats why the characters felt flat as cardboard for me gave it a because of that didnt see and jumped straight to bh because everyone said skip bh is way better
anime,not_removed,relies on having seen fma for a lot of characterisation very rushed first couple of episodes a classic case of biting off more than your can chew and wanting to have your cake and eat it too adaptationwise i think bones wanted to adapt the manga to the end they couldnt make it a sequel because the original fma had an original story and conclusion so they had to start at the beginning as a remake but they honestly didnt have the episode runlength to cover it all properly they wanted to pull in people who loved the version but they also wanted a modern audience cant have it both ways because the original audience will get bored by so many episodes of recap retelling the first half of the original series meanwhile those episodes are important for the people new to the story for characters and worldbuilding the result is lets try and do a rush of the first half of the original series in episodes and hope we dont lose too many people then get to the new stuff
anime,not_removed,i mean the females being violent is part of the comedy you really expect it to have consequences
anime,not_removed,i love brotherhood but at times the humor really ruined what could have been fantastic dramatic moments especially early on
anime,not_removed,yes i too wish childrens death
anime,not_removed,i dont understand how people can think episode shows are ever slow people should expect everything they watch weekly to be slow because they are watching it slowly at minutes a week if you watch it outside of this weekly paradigm it only takes a few hours until the plot thickens and by that time your half way done with the show slow
anime,not_removed,i only disliked the first episode it was alright then and awesome by the end
anime,not_removed,reigen did nothing wrong
anime,not_removed,spoiler he had no idea what was really happening right place right time circumstance is not redeeming he manipulates and uses mob which makes him a bad person he takes advantage of peoples ignorance or emotions for monetary gain
anime,not_removed,i related to shinjis emotional state a lot which is why it was hard for me to watch everyone around him treat him like shit he gets progressively more depressed as the series progresses but the people he trusts just abuse him even more instead of responding to his pleas for help anime was my main form of escapism at the time and i wanted the shows i watched to tell me everything was going to be ok in the end idk i guess nge just hit a bit to close to home for me haha
anime,not_removed,i would argue that s gendo isnt using yui as a trump card against seele my impression was that she was semiposthumously using him to carry out her plans for instrumentality
anime,not_removed,yes that my bad i should have specified
anime,not_removed,that character development thing has always been a pet peeve of mine id rather have a thoroughly fleshed out and multidimensional character than have a boring character go through some growth obviously you can have both but sometimes the plot of a show can just be to explore a characters psyche like in evangelion
anime,not_removed,id like to see an asssniper now
anime,not_removed,no theyre not because they never fucking explain them in the actual anime i still dont know what the fuck it means that her soul is in the eva and ive researched it like why
anime,not_removed,your spoiler tags are sporadic i see what you did there
anime,not_removed,for sure and that mystery as to what the evas are for example is excellent but then again theres mystery to everything and theres a clear lack of exposition should the viewer be forced to go back and rewatch the show just to understand a bit more look at how our understanding of eva came about people dedicated to the series sat through and analyzed parts of it and even used sources outside of the anime just to explain some minor details imagine what its like to the first time viewer who just wants to watch eva and not have to go searching for answers on what the heck they just saw
anime,not_removed,when you need to explore a dozen different side materials and read the lore collections in spin off video games in order for the basic elements of the plot to even be explained at all it is definitely too far in the opposite direction evas story being so sloppy and vague is the only reason i have it at a instead of a
anime,not_removed,long scenes of characters sitting around explaining everything as opposed to evas long scenes of characters standing around explaining nothing
anime,not_removed,look at it from a first time viewers perspective as experienced viewers weve had to really look and pay attention to some very minor things just to understand a bit of the story better but someone who is new would be lost to these facts and would end up disliking it because they just arent given sufficient information to really know what is happening what you just said about seele is explained s its pretty obvious that seele want instrumentality to happen on their terms with the dead sea scrolls they all know what the purpose and end state of instrumentality will be but it is seele that wants to bring it to fruition and not allow it to be gendo with eva
anime,not_removed,its not that shes useless as much as i dont remember there being anything remarkable or developed about her and yea i dont think its a bad show as much as i think it was a show that isnt suitable to me i did like kyubey though hes cute oh gosh thats part of my fear of magical girl raising project i keep on debating on whether i want to watch it or not on one hand the character designs look great and it looks like there might be some great cuteness in there on the other hand i dont like the dark twist thats in it and if it ends up getting too dark for me which is pretty easy ill probably end up disliking it
anime,not_removed,almost no conflict depends on what you compare it to and the episodes in question gonna say your comment speaks to the notoriety of some of the edgier fanworks because if you actually watched much you would know its not moestyle sol all the time
anime,not_removed,i personally enjoy the slightly warped way araragi views the world so having it be in firstperson and completely through his sense of his surroundings and the people in them is a huge selling point of the show to me i think a lot of the relationships between characters would suffer at least in their visual execution if we were taken out of araragis pov and while i would agree about the sister thing both karen and tsukihi are canonically kind of s yandere about koyomi when they first learn about gahara tsukihi attacks him for kissing her during nisemonogatari even though he already had a girlfriend and karen destroys their living room throwing a huge tantrum during which she both roasts koyomi and offers her body to him the araragi family dynamic is kind of just weird as hell
anime,not_removed,i havent actually seen the series i just know it by reputation
anime,not_removed,ive found that im usually fine as long as i keep my criticism personal and avoid purposefully inflammatory language i didnt like and here are all the things that didnt resonate with me is much better than is objectively bad and here are all the things that suck about it people like having discussions but they understandably get defensive when someone randomly starts shitting on things they like it also helps that i have very few strong opinions when it comes to anime in general haha
anime,not_removed,i find shaft to typically be very niche and different but its still my favorite studio sorry about your experience its fine to not like something what about shaft do you not like what studios do you like
anime,not_removed,yeah like for example s they fall into a river and i gotta wonder how the fuck did that happen that straight up sounds like something a single mom would have waking nightmares about like if that were my mom she would probably tell the kids every day s dont go near the river dont go near the river dont go near the river dont go near the fucking river do you hear me i will fuck you up if you ever do and my mom isnt even a single mother moreover that plot line could happen but the fact that it just happens randomly seems like the way a higher class person thinks tragedy happens
anime,not_removed,i was never able to pinpoint what i dislike about hana but maybe this is it shes too perfect and innocent for her struggles to carry any real weight for me
anime,not_removed,ginapproves disappearance is hard because it is just solid beyond the grandfather paradox the only things i can remember people not liking were pacing because its long though its hard to make it shorter and otherwise just not liking the characters like you for example other than that theres just a lot of personal stuff like s rathering kyon stay in the altered world rather than hitting the reset but i dont think that counts technically yeah the wolf children one was really quick to come to mind despite the fact that i never actually thought about it until now because i know a lot of reddit doesnt like dealing with kids
anime,not_removed,personally i thought they did pretty good with the second half all things considered not as good as one might hope hence it not being a on my list but good regardless however as i stated in my comment i totally see why someone would find it disappointing recently ive really found myself wishing it had been a cour show so that they could extend the episodic part of the show and have more time to flush out the story the characters being weak is a criticism i hear a lot although ive never completely never understood why maybe its just that some people connect and relate to them and some dont i thought cocona had a couple really strong character arcs and i was able to relate to her in a couple personal ways although i guess that just might not be the case for everyone
anime,not_removed,true i guess the show never really did beat you over the head with minor plot details
anime,not_removed,how can anyone like moe
anime,not_removed,its interesting to me how the fanservice in flfl has different effects on different people personally i didnt even think about them until people started criticizing them on the episode discussions the only scenes i thought were really uncomfortable about the shows sexual aspect were the ones where i felt like i was supposed to feel uncomfortable s like the villain from episode or episode when they were poking fun at the mecha genre etc its definitely a valid criticism of the show i just find it interesting that some people found it to be a major turn off and some were able to look past it
anime,not_removed,a couple bad fanservice scenes dropped the series a rank for me just on its own i cant fully enjoy a show if i dont feel comfortable watching its character portrayals i agree with you but if you say this in the episode threads youll get laughed out the door for being antifanservice sexhating puritan
anime,not_removed,in a show that was so ambitious and original it makes me really sad they decided to do that whether they wanted to or felt they had to to get attention some of the writers are known to make super safe childrens anime so they probably wanted to mix it up a bit plus the directors forte is sexual comedy so a lot of those aspects came together also the shows scifi visual imagery mixes with the fairytale aesthetic replete with the style super sexual scifi costumes i get why its not going to be to everyones taste but i dont think it was just to be pandering i think they did so fully well trying to mix up the visual aesthetic with that conflicting visual styles
anime,not_removed,yeah a few shots in the first transformation sequence were a bit gratuitous really couldve done without the middleschool flipflaps
anime,not_removed,s even if its kinda shounen bullshit i dont think its far fetched that all might defeated nomu even with his injury i mean nomu was created right how do you create something to be stronger than the strongest being on the planet and how do you know its actually stronger my take on it is that they created this super monster and were like holy shit hes so strong all might is fucked whereas its just not enough all might is still stronger
anime,not_removed,depends on how much of the s stain arc will be covered thats when the story really picked for me personally
anime,not_removed,for toradora it does that but so do a lot of shows i still couldnt stand that taiga was just a hugely abusive tsundere and kitamura just seemed meh ryuuji was cool at times minori i really dont have an opinion of she just felt incredibly unimportant until the christmas part and then was unimportant right after that s i also feel like ami made the best pair with ryuuji largely because of that conversation they have near the end of the series but i cant do anything about that for tatami it just felt like it ended abruptly s i dont even remember if he ended up going out with asahi because he pretty much broke out of the tatami galaxy and then the show ended within the next like minutes
anime,not_removed,and akashi happens to be my favorite character in anime id just like to point out how funny that seems to me given that she shows up in maybe of the show itself
anime,not_removed,s oh i completely understand why ozu did the things he did but to me thats still not in anyway an excuse for having done them no i havent i got out of high school last year and i probably wont have that experience so that could be part of it but its not that i couldnt understand his troubles but more that he didnt couldnt do anything about them he kept going through the same struggle over and over again by then end of episode i was pretty interested in his character and i wanted to see where he would go the answer is nowhere for episodes i wanted to see them grow as people especially watashi but by the time we got to episode i just couldnt care that anything happened
anime,not_removed,to antagonize means to agitate the term is often too rigidly applied to villains only when it refers to any force which is meant to oppose or act as an agitant thereby acting as a source of motivation i know of very few shows with such poor animation but it is original
anime,not_removed,do you think its glorified i didnt get that sense
anime,not_removed,i could level the same criticism vs any show of that nature ie rezero nhk inai machi kiznaiver etc not all use the same mechanics but the themes of hikikomori and redo your life are very closely related in that regard steinsgate is probably the only show which i can think of that handles those themes correctly i suppose im too much of a httpsenwikipediaorgwikifatalism to believe in fairy tales like that the google definition sucks its not rigid determinism
anime,not_removed,i saw it a bit differently ie s the moth to the flame symbolism desperately searching for the light in front of your face only to be burned by it then feeling trapped or isolated in the rooms sequence leading to reflections of his life while desperately seeking a way out the old lady who keeps telling him he needs to make a change and grab what is within reach it all seems like a rather subjectively forced selfhelp or improvement manual
anime,not_removed,no onikakushi starts the same way in the vns as the anime it does juxtapose those two scenes because you hear keiichis inner monologue though
anime,not_removed,i didnt dislike anything else about the series just the gore i was really enjoying it otherwise so im sad i had to drop it haha
anime,not_removed,i still enjoyed the anime as a whole dont get me wrong girls do things like in the show all the time and are not gay some of them do things that if they showed in anime would make people lose their shit over yuribait maybe other girls are different but the only time ive ever experienced moments with another girl irl were during instances of heavy romantic tension im also not saying your interpretation is wrong its just those gestures paired with the dramatic soundtrack intense animation and close camera angles read as overtly romantic to me i dont have a problem with kumiko and reina just being close friends i just wish their relationship was framed slightly differently as someone with very little representation in media its frustrating when writers purposefully string me along for a whole season just to go nah jk at the last second and leave me hanging this happens all the time and not just in anime either but thats a whole other issue that im not going to get into here haha i guess were just approaching this from different perspectives
anime,not_removed,midori is the one who gets kumiko to join the band i always considered it hazuki to be the one who got kumiko to do this hazukis persistence and her attitude towards music reminded kumiko of how and why she got into music and inspired her to continue
anime,not_removed,i dont think thats how mob mentality works wouldnt they gravitate to the guy who just saved their life i find it hard to believe they would all get angry rather than relieved or at most a little unsure at saitamas ridiculous power
anime,not_removed,right and those were definitely enjoyable departures from the norm hxh is certainly exceptional in many ways
anime,not_removed,i have the series as a but i admit its flaws u wot dude s the strongest being on earth was born and our mc is on a fucking date greed island while it is fun it is still mostly a training arc with little tension being between yc and ca arcs doesnt really help i really liked aluka as a character and to see he was actually a family member killua cared for was always cool pouf was just fucking annoying agreed
anime,not_removed,like every named ant got a backstory episode many not surviving the next
anime,not_removed,noted thanks
anime,not_removed,really imo you could cut episodes from ca without loosing anything of value
anime,not_removed,it feels way too serious and dark without that little adventurous derpy feel everything before it had i wasted time on hxh twice and never managed to get through chimera ants fuck that arc
anime,not_removed,that face when when
anime,not_removed,oh ya those scenes when something good happens that isnt immediately ruined by narration
anime,not_removed,the ending was the best part when it finally ended
anime,not_removed,it could have worked better if it didnt drag out and show the same scenes over and over again the narration instead of showing what happened spent about mins an episode explaining what was happening not through dialogue just some weird boring narration
anime,not_removed,yeah one piece is too long but a good show overall i like fairy tail but it has serious problems too i like hunterxhunter as well just hate the chimera ant arc
anime,not_removed,from what i heard the ln was more compellingbetter done i think that some decisions made with the adaptation definitely held it back even if the plot itself still wasnt my favorite
anime,not_removed,unfortunately i cant defend the end because thats how the first volume basically ended s a scene they didnt include which i thought was awesome is that snow and ripple get called by the magical girl council interviewing them and stuff asking whether they want their memories removed of what happened but the ln is interesting as someone who is volumes in
anime,not_removed,i think the art style might actually be my biggest complaint everything is way too cutesy and over designed to really take seriously and it ruins some moments because of that id still watch a second season since the source supposedly gets better but it was more than a bit messy for the first that and the one kinda clever thing they did with s snow white not doing anything and still winning was undermined by the show taking every opportunity to point it out to the viewer
anime,not_removed,the beggining of it still gives me slight chills i feel it could have been a bit less heavy on the bass but its still great
anime,not_removed,yeah the cassim arc was definitely a bit weird for that i heard it was done a lot better in the manga and ive been considering picking that up recently since i like the series same here i also heard they changed some stuff around in the arc following that one so im curious to see whats different in that one as well well thats what the spinoff is for but theres also not enough sinbad in the spinoff either and fanart saved
anime,not_removed,the anime isnt that much different from the manga it only sort of differs at the ending of season with the sequence of events and what happens to who but it ends in both sources on the same note season is a direct adaptation
anime,not_removed,what didnt you like about morgiana shes typically considered a fan favorite
anime,not_removed,i didnt say it was slow i said it was bad it goes up and down way too much s the whole balbadd arc could have been shortened to fewer episodes but the dungeon was over way too fast which really failed to show the difficulty of going through them aladdins magnostadt arc is stretched out too much the series has too much exposition at times because they want to explain the political reasons for a lot of whats happening while at the same time trying to be a shonen battle series it has issues man but i like the series as a whole
anime,not_removed,its called the toei syndrome
anime,not_removed,literally alchemy from xing
anime,not_removed,all the way to the end just because i wasnt alone in my suffering
anime,not_removed,yeah first episode of fmab acts as if it expects its audience to already know who ed and al are first episode felt quite fanservicey to me in that aspect and is one major reason i always recommend fma for the beginning
anime,not_removed,didnt see and jumped straight to bh because everyone said skip bh is way better a terrible mistake imo i know a lot of people who make this claim but i feel like it overlooks a serious issue brotherhood works on the assumption you have seen the original if not you are truly missing out on a lot of character development and some strong moments lose a lot of punch on the breakneck speed bh goes over them they truly work best together
anime,not_removed,slow like most things is a word that makes sense only in comparison shounens are generally faster paced and the sol aspects of mob make it a bit slow
anime,not_removed,ehh since you didnt speciafy what you were replying i will make different thoughts s while he didnt knew the situation he told a bunch of what he thought were normal delinquents to find a live and not be slaves a manipulator wouldnt really do that he also knew the boss was a esper because the dude threw him an energy ball and reigen made the wut face he tends to make the dude does want to help mob in becoming a better person he could easily told mob to kick ass run like the supposed badcoward person you say or abandon the other guys fighting but he reduced to protect mob and told him to never use his powers to harm others even though he was surrounded by explosions and i remark he still gives a service and makes his customers happy and if he was that much after money he can use a kaiki style of strategy and leave them on the street
anime,not_removed,no worries im an enormous eva fan myself and i think it does a lot of really good things and pulls a great story overall but i certainly recognize that it isnt perfect and it happens to have holes here and there
anime,not_removed,rnocontext
anime,not_removed,the entire line for the part you just tagged should be under a tag since the leadin itself draws attention to a plot point and might imply relevance where not directly stated tell me when youve addressed that and ill reapprove it
anime,not_removed,when you need to explore a dozen different side materials and read the lore collections in spin off video games in order for the basic elements of the plot to even be explained at all but you dont i didnt need to sure i didnt get it all on my first watchthrough or my second or third or fourth but i got there eventually the one thing i did cheat on was a google search for what the symbols in reis birthplace meant and i learned that they were quantum mechanics stuff which helped me put the rest together ive never consumed any eva content beyond the episodes of the show end of evangelion and the rebuilds which have nothing to do with anything and are trash
anime,not_removed,look at it from a first time viewers perspective as experienced viewers weve had to really look and pay attention to some very minor things just to understand a bit of the story better but someone who is new would be lost to these facts and would end up disliking it because they just arent given sufficient information to really know what is happening i dunno what you mean by no sense of the word am i an experienced viewer and bout seele s yes that was what happening and that was very clearly stated its also been by that stage longestablished that there is some kind of ideological conflict and difference in goals between seeles impact and gendos impact s however theres no real narrative evidence to makae the viewer believe that gendos impact is going to be better or worse than seeles impact both gendo and seele are dickbags interested in their own mysterious goals basically the viewer doesnt have a side to root for and a great deal of narrative tension is lost the attack on nerv is pointless and silly but eoe protrays it as very serious business
anime,not_removed,i watched the first seasons its shallow sol friendship crap with a few episodes being a bit darker certainly not as dark as madoka and certainly not having all the themes madoka covers
anime,not_removed,a first person pov and an unreliable narrator arent the same thing hyouka for instance is told from orekis pov but theres no evidence of him being an unreliable narrator and still has beautiful visuals for character relationships and orekis warped view of the world in oregairu is another example i suppose you could personally argue that theyre unreliable narrators but its not established in their shows and i cant think of much evidence for it the araragi family dynamic is kind of just weird as hell wow ive never read those books dont worry i probably never will but that kinda makes me like the unreliable narrator stuff even less are they told from the sisters pov
anime,not_removed,i remember when i was watching mekaku and bakemonogatari there were weird scenes where the dialogue would just stop and there would be a dramatic head tilt for no reason most of the time it was their artistic choices that didnt mix well with me also bakemonogatari was not at all what i was expecting senjougahara is apparently a vampire but thats hardly touched on at all in the episodes i watched it was mostly her toying with the mc and the loli who was always lost i guess i was expecting something more fast paced as for nisekoi i just couldnt stand the gorilla so i stopped it those are the only shaft shows ive seen but i have on my ptw
anime,not_removed,yeah i totally get you thats a really interesting and fair criticism thanks for sharing it
anime,not_removed,yeah shes a character i admire but not necessarily one i relate to
anime,not_removed,i mean there were a lot of useless characters that really didnt do anything and of which i didnt even see the point like the team cocona was working with there was nothing to them really weak supporting castpapika was really annoying but thats just me cocana was interesting i really liked her but in the end they just made her motivations yuri feelings for papaki which really undermined her character and yeah the plot well i really disliked it so much shit came out of nowhere was never explained and to top it off cocanas s mother being the villain was just stupid it made no sense in the end they went for cheap surprises in the plot edit its not that i disliked everything though i really loved some of the ways they portrayed feelings especially the episode with coconas inner struggle and her going through all these different scenerios in the that other world which represented her feelings and doubts that was cool
anime,not_removed,😡
anime,not_removed,there were times it didnt bother me but there were times when we just got low angle shots or skirt lifting for no reason and buchan felt like he existed solely to be a robotic creeper and different cultural perspectives notwithstanding it bothered me dont get be wrong i looked past it in the sense that i still really enjoyed the show but even if the rest of the show had been perfect that would have marred its image for me
anime,not_removed,honestly i dont think flfl would be as expressive without that fanservice element it was a show trying to express itself in the most vibrant and wild ways possible and whether thats the action or the sexual element i dont think it would have worked if it held back on them i get why such aspects arent going to be everyones cup of tea but i think the show needed to be that wild personally
anime,not_removed,yeah i wouldnt put down someones distaste over it even though i personally liked the over the top imagery though i suspect the show decided to get as sexual as it did in order to supplement its crazy storytelling with visual overload also many people in the storyboarding and writing and director crew worked on sexual comedy anime in the not too distant past and maybe they just wanted some of that in this original story
anime,not_removed,well saying negative things about any show in its episode threads is risking your comment karma but that doesnt bother me terribly but in any case i like to think my criticism is levelheaded since i dont hate any and all sexual aspects flatout there are good and bad ways to introduce that sort of thing edit wording
anime,not_removed,thats two arcs away right
anime,not_removed,that character was already shown after the credits of final episode
anime,not_removed,what other shows do you feel do that as well id love to watch more shows that do characters well and from a trope and romance perspective toradora is currently the model for shows trying to do that i see youre on the taiga abusive camp and i cant say its not a valid dislike simply because its so common but honestly most of her physical violence was fine with me due to the comedy and medium obviously if i was around someone that kicked me or poked me in the eyes when she was upset id dump her right away but obviously the anime doesnt consider it that serious or hed be seriously wounded and i find her personality to be understandable given her situation and history ill accept your criticisms of kitamura and minori minoris my favorite but you really have to like her spunk and passion to care about her s ami definitely feels the most natural in her conversations with ryuuji but shes immature in her own way and i really dont think they have the chemistry theyd need to be good together its a completely oneway attraction for better or worse and yeah s the show ends as soon as they basically get together and its both perfect and sad that you dont get to see the relationship but i respect the decision to quite while youre ahead especially since a successful relationship was not within the shows themes and scope i understand that frustration though
anime,not_removed,yeah shes not the main character for sure but shes absolutely perfect p i love her character design every part of her personality the fact that shes refreshingly different and i guess i find it easy to relate to the mc and s his love for her which makes the fact that she likes him extra rewarding she might not show up as much as girls in other shows but she feels magnitudes more real shes not fake and cutesy missing character outside of a trope or two or pure wish fulfillment i dont feel like im coming up with enough reasons but its probably just a matter of clicking with a character i could expound on what i like about her personality but it probably wouldnt make you like her more
anime,not_removed,the term is often too rigidly applied to villains only fair enough ozus an antagonist but hes not really the point nor the primary conflict of the show the animations certainly not impressive but i could probably name plenty of shows that did worse jobs the movements were fluid and expressive when necessary and brings out the yuasas fantastic directing skills
anime,not_removed,nhk may be over exaggerated to make the story interesting but id say it best represents that theme steinsgate isnt really about shut ins its a great scifi story thats aimed at otaku but anyone can watch it and still enjoy it
anime,not_removed,i dont disagree i just think thats simply the core message of the show whether that is too convenient for the protagonist is really up to each viewers take on the protagonist and how much of his tale is easy to relate to
anime,not_removed,s the vn has the monologue along with the fact that out of context you dont know what is actually happening the show clearly goes for the shock of the sudden gore right from the start
anime,not_removed,i get what you mean must be pretty frustrating hell is super frustrating to me so i can only imagine how it must be to you its just peat peeve of mine because when a lot people talk about this particular show its often dismissed and reduced to simply yuri bait i guess its just a difference in culture in my country people in general are very close so things like this i associate with a close friendship rather than a romantic one thou i aggre that the those scenes are framed in such a way that they could be interpreted as such there is this from one of my favourite youtubes that doesnt touch that much on the topic at hand but does a great job explaning alot of what i like and how i view the show and he as very little recognition so i try to find excuses to show is stuff to people
anime,not_removed,tru tru
anime,not_removed,but then whos the audience in the battle tower arc they watch these fights all the time they must know what it is or is the audience just other contestants because that seems like a money sink that sounds unsustainable for such a massive organisation
anime,not_removed,is that so i guess its my mistake then or his
anime,not_removed,dude hxh spoilers well gon is retarded s not like he knew the strongest being on earth was being born while he was on a date
anime,not_removed,ok cant argue with that one
anime,not_removed,hxh was always dark never really portrayed that as good as the anime where the tone is really different it has its own fanbase that basically wish death to the version until ca arc of course
anime,not_removed,it feels way too serious and dark without that little adventurous derpy feel everything before it had but it is serious and dark thats not a problem its how the arc is oo
anime,not_removed,it feels way too serious and dark without that little adventurous derpy feel everything before it had mate s just in the first episode its revealed that kurapika is in a revenge mission because a group of assassins killed his whole tribe and in episode hisoka kills a bunch of guys with a card hxh is fucking dark
anime,not_removed,dammit
anime,not_removed,scenes those scenes and the whole last episode would be worth the rest even if the rest was actually bad isnt immediately ruined by narration to be fair i would put this on togashi not the anime the narration part is taken straight from the manga
anime,not_removed,ok
anime,not_removed,both narration and pacing are really subjective things i dont have problem with either and for example i never understand people saying stuff of fmabs pacing also consider it is a shounen in the end having aired between weeks and knowing how the whole thing was structured it required lots of reuse of scenes
anime,not_removed,yeah pretty much there was actually an altered character death in the anime which was a really important revelation it does get better like a bit of a spoiler but the volume which is basically a battle royale but volume is a mystery and the world building of the magical girl world council or whatever the fuck they are is somewhat interesting which madoka lacked
anime,not_removed,i think season had a lot of changes i heard for zagan i think it was just order and that some event happened earlier in the anime than it did in the manga also some censorship i believe with regards to blood in the first season the was a pretty good adaptation apparently though
anime,not_removed,she just didnt seem to get any development or growth she kind of had to be forced out of her shackles and i could understand that but with the tone of the show otherwise it just felt like they couldve given her more strength in terms of personality rather than just brute strength felt like something was distinctly missing maybe there was more of that cut from the manga
anime,not_removed,but it worked differently or something like that
anime,not_removed,and that scene took the place one of my favorite moments from the series s the younger brothers suicide eds reaction to that scene is just so fantastic
anime,not_removed,literally nothing in the nge or eoe explains what the fruit of life or fruit of knowledge are what the lance of longinus is or where it comes from or what it does what the chamber of guf is what seeles real goal was and how their version of the third impact differed from the one gendo sought any mention at all of the first ancestral race et cetera
anime,not_removed,well sure compared to madoka but how can i put this if you wanna talk about no conflict its not lucky star either
anime,not_removed,nah theyre from koyomis but there is surprisingly little that suggests that hes exaggerating too much maybe hyping up karens power levels a little bit but otherwise the majority of the dialogue isnt particularly flattering towards him and youre right about the pov thing poor phrasing on my part theyre actually super short probably around words max i can link the karen one mostly because it is just in case you change your mind
anime,not_removed,senjougahara is apparently a vampire she isnt a vampire so that would explain it
anime,not_removed,i get what youre saying i guess im just approaching the show from a different perspective im working on an analytical essay on it right now and have come to believe that most of the show revolves directly around coconas character and that shes the only part of the show tethered to reality that is i tend to think that papika and yayaka are more symbolic of her mental state than literal characters so im not as quick to criticize their development although ive yet to find a purpose for the loli amorphus child or buchan i definitely agree that the plot was very far from perfect i really wanted to give it a but as you said there was too much that came out of nowhere s actually i thought that coconas mother being the villain was one of the most clever parts of the plot since it emphasized the theme of personal identity and maturity and coconas struggles with separating herself from the identities of the parents she never knew which seems to be one of the shows core themes a bigger issue to me is that the organization with the hooded people the show spent so much time hinting at ended up not being very relevant
anime,not_removed,yeah i tend to think that buchan is one of the weakest parts of the show and likewise i thought episode was the weakest out of the bunch in fact episode was the first one that made me genuinely concerned for the shows future i personally found that fear to be in vain but it is worth noting it makes me wonder what the approach of the creators where to scenes like that a lot of people were originally attracted to it because of how much it reminded them of gainaxtrigger stuff it makes me wonder if the creators took more inspiration from those studios than just their art style
anime,not_removed,thats a very interesting perspective i tend to lean towards that line of thinking as well
anime,not_removed,but we still have the sports festival arc to get through before we really get into his stuff how much do you think will be covered in the episodes we will get
anime,not_removed,off the top of my head i hear asuka from evangelion and haruhi though calling her a tsundere is iffy both have strong reasons for why they act the way they do im not saying shes entirely abusive since she obviously grows out of it and clearly since i like haruhi im not averse to that sort of thing i think my problem is just the fact that she is abusive at the beginning haruhi never gets that severe until her explosion and then afterwards she mellows out significantly taiga mellows but the level at which shes at at the beginning is just not something im ok with s im not necessarily averse to it ending after they get together i just think it went so quickly after he gets out of the tatami galaxy that the payoff just wasnt there i dont even remember them getting together because everything just blurs
anime,not_removed,yeah i actually really liked her a lot and was super disappointed that she didnt appear more her design was just really nice i feel like its a senjougahara situation where id probably like her more but she just doesnt exist in her own show
anime,not_removed,s fails to expand upon the subject matter and the causes of that behaviour in that sense it provides a false narrative and perpetuates stereotypes of hikikomori aoi bungaku ningen shikkaku arc on the other hand does cover those other factors including war economics society status ecchi betrayal etc s all of the characters are tropes of various forms ie moeka tv is like a mother to me also a shutin cosplayers crossdressers otaku moenekos maidcafes hackersnerds harems and various japaneseglobal societal issues in a satirical fashion it doesnt end on the note that life was badsucks either but that it should be accepted as a form of fatalism ie the past cannot and should not be altered
anime,not_removed,thats interesting about your culture im american and i know that americans are a lot less physically affectionate than many other countries i know were actually more physical than japan though which is also part of the reason i interpreted those gestures as romantic haha that video looks really interesting but its for me right now and i have class in the morning lol ill watch it tomorrow i promise
anime,not_removed,spoiler tag dude
anime,not_removed,welp then im some filthy secondary who prefers inferior product yuishrug
anime,not_removed,that is a problem because it makes this arc sucks in comparison to what was before it
anime,not_removed,but for the most part that darkness is kinda balanced by gons childish simplistic nature chimera arc lacks that little bit of goofiness
anime,not_removed,you know as a person who read the manga first i agreed with you at first but then i had a discussion with someone else who pointed out that the anime should have taken the opportunity to improve upon the manga by cutting out a lot of the extraneous narration even though i was ok with in the manga since i can read through most of it quickly it slowed the pacing of the anime to a crawl and that should have been taken into consideration
anime,not_removed,fmab has no pacing issues that is how an anime should be paced and yes it is a shounen and they reuse scenes but not whole episodes usually just about minutes in the start of the episode this damn arc showed the same scene so many times or just paused on it for basically entire episodes
anime,not_removed,s amestrians used tectonic energy xingnese use dragon pulse aka aura the same way ling and his squad estimate the homunculi power
anime,not_removed,other the third impact one everything thats plot relevant is explained through context we may not know exactly what the lance of longinus is or how engines work but we understand what they are doing and their importance to whats going on the eoe third impact motivations always felt intentional to me with both sides fighting to effectively achieve the same thing
anime,not_removed,well whatever madokas made by adults for adults mlp is made by adults for little girls but the show isnt utter shit so it is watchable its still a stupid comparison to make
anime,not_removed,lol note taken but she is involved with the supernatural somehow right
anime,not_removed,yea i read something about that theory once it was really interesting but imo the second half kind of excludes that of being possible that would have been really interesting in the end its only what really matters to you in a story it didnt really click with me but i can appreciate some things in the story it definetly had some really interesting ways of storytelling and was quite unique with my earlier example being my favorite feel free to tag me or pm me if you finish that essay id be interested in hearing another perspective
anime,not_removed,yeah i wonder the plot and conflict were certainly on a similar scale
anime,not_removed,i like eva and haruhi a lot too i will admit im i have a bias towards tsunderes im a big sucker for the emotional gap that requires patience and time and development to cross so even though taiga would probably bother me in real life i enjoy seeing her grow and change while not exactly being bothered by her initial failings
anime,not_removed,it was enough for me but i would definitely love more senjougahara is actually very similar in that she may be my favorite monogatari girl and i didnt mind her relative absence but would still love more
anime,not_removed,wow that part of about steinsgate was pretty deep i never really gave the plot any analytical thought i doubt the creators of the vn had that message in mind though
anime,not_removed,but then magic exists and the audience knows it right how difficult a leap is it really that they figure out its nen the audience might not understand the specifics of controlling it but whats the point of keeping it a secret
anime,not_removed,woops forgot
anime,not_removed,i actually liked the adventurous tone of over dark tone but i just love ca specially the palace invasion not often do i see episodes in a single day
anime,not_removed,fmab has no pacing issues i mean i would agree but it is the most common complain after the comedy being on this same thread but not whole episodes can you point out when
anime,not_removed,fmab has no pacing issues it has the opposite problem to hxh it starts way too fast and wants to get to the action quick maybe because the creators assumed original fma knowledge but that ends up lessening the impact of s hughes death it certainly has fewer pacing problems than hxh but it doesnt mean it doesnt have any of them
anime,not_removed,i didnt not sure where this line of thought even started
anime,not_removed,only for the first two episodes then shes not really other than being near when supernatural people are around
anime,not_removed,sorry not you the guy you originally talked about
anime,not_removed,i dont mean theyd automatically think nen as in the word itself but i see someone doing something magic my first thought is its an illusion and how did he do that in this world its been happening on a regular scale that its an illusion doesnt hold up especially when at the higher ranks theyre destroying an arena itself once that happens someone would naturally ask how are they doing that and once people have been debating it long enough im sure they would come to the conclusion that these people are manipulating forces of nature through some power of their own especially when they know it is dependent on the skill of the person which is the point of the tower itself so far the secret has only been the name nen and the specifics of how you use it if i were in that world id know something was up almost immediately plus itd have been leaked somehow or somewhere long before the stuff in the show goes down but thats just speculation
anime,not_removed,spoiler tags s i definitely disagree with any episode since thats not true it reused stuff every now and then but not everytime aand about the second part wasnt that only episodes when they fought not to mention they were talking to each other
anime,not_removed,please spoiler tag this thanks
anime,not_removed,all good i have a bad habit of defending it too hard ill say this uhh conflict doesnt have to mean fighting
anime,not_removed,this has been pretty great to watch today its a long shot but itd be nice if this campaigns success resulted in kemonozume and kaiba getting some wider physical distribution too
anime,not_removed,im surprised the goal was only £ seems awfully low for releasing a bd worldwide
anime,not_removed,nice to see that due to a wide recognition for yuasas latest works like ping pong and the upcoming movies people are intrested to see his former works like mind game and maybe kaiba in the future
anime,not_removed,i didnt have the money to donate to this so it makes me happy that this was funded so quickly
anime,not_removed,damn i didnt even have time to donate so when can i get it
anime,not_removed,sad no dub
anime,not_removed,have their own crowdfunding effort up on their site aiming for yen this is just anime ltd providing supportdistribution like they did with time of eves crowdfunded bd
anime,not_removed,youve still got days to donate
anime,not_removed,i mean is still pretty low
anime,not_removed,honest question why donate if they already reached their goal
anime,not_removed,an interview with gainax veterans i read over at wave motion cannon mentioned that crowd funding is mainly used as an opportunity for advertising and connections with the fans not really as an actual means of fully funding a project though that was in the context of producing a new show dont know how applicable it is in this case link to interview
anime,not_removed,larger budgets allow better products also its common practice for kickstarter rewards to be cheaper than buying the product later
anime,not_removed,pretty sure thats the case here it was said that would cover the remaining costs though perhaps they wont have to now probably also helps that anime ltd as a company are quite economical compared to something like funimation for example
anime,not_removed,looks like i got to wait for a mirror
anime,not_removed,and here im still wondering where the hole is
anime,not_removed,i might have to revisit this one once the dub comes out a lot of the titular dirty jokes jokes in the original either fell flat or just seemed extremely basic imo but if its getting the psg treatment itd probably be worth a rewatch
anime,not_removed,pantydropping fun voice of panty from ps i see what you did there if that was supposed to be anna at the end though the voice is way higher than i imagined it would be edit god damn it i just realized thats stockings voice
anime,not_removed,the team must have had quite the time dubbing this one
anime,not_removed,i may just watch this dub for the jokes i wanna see if they actually made good ones or not
anime,not_removed,sos sox
anime,not_removed,the blu rays come with a fucking sock to jack off into httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlywvtbgkheu starts at
anime,not_removed,mirror
anime,not_removed,its been dubbed guess im gonna have to watch again to see how the english vas do the roles xd
anime,not_removed,as much as this is neat its a reminder that we will probably will never get a season
anime,not_removed,makes me do a captcha not available
anime,not_removed,the vas reminds me of those that did panty and stocking
anime,not_removed,oh cool i was wanting to buy this ill have to wait till i have money to order this though also that sock as a bonusthe fuck
anime,not_removed,my goodness how did this manage to get approved not that im complaining
anime,not_removed,they changed cockadoodlepussy to just cock balls ill stick with sub this time thank you very much
anime,not_removed,i really dislike how every dub seems to have the same voices for male characters
anime,not_removed,mirror pls
anime,not_removed,more than anything i am curious to hyokas english va performance

anime,not_removed,dirty jokes in japanese are one of those things that dont really translate very well in terms of both offensiveness and impact psg was a perfect way to get the same feel across in english

anime,not_removed,sure if
anime,not_removed,youre really gonna write off a dub based off of one sentence
anime,not_removed,i like it and dislike it at the same time josh grelle is probably my favorite male voice actor for comedy so i dont mind how much he keeps turning up in stuff but it is strange to see him in so many lead roles recently

anime,not_removed,if they did a dub thatd be pretty cool british voices worked for xenoblade chronicles
anime,not_removed,great anime cool story but i still have trouble keeping up with that pace
anime,not_removed,is this subs only tg was one of those shows id love to see dubbed but imagine it is impossible
anime,not_removed,hopefully with the better subtitling available to bluray the sign subs will be as comprehensive as those on funimations youtube channel the beez dvds left quite a lot untranslated which i like to imagine was because including the shows full text content wouldve pushed them over the maximum disc capacity
anime,not_removed,one of my alltime favorites this series seems difficult to dub but heres hoping itll be great
anime,not_removed,shit despite not recognizing the name anime limited i assumed this was an america distributor when reading the title oh well hopefully some day

anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,is it cheating to say relife if not then yeah from this season it would be relife
anime,not_removed,this season probably amaama though to be different ill say days only because httpiimgurcomsrqavbbjpg is by far my favourite character this season
anime,not_removed,cheer danshi by a fair bit
anime,not_removed,its between shokugeki no souma and love live ss after those would be tenkyou no alderamin and days
anime,not_removed,jojo
anime,not_removed,for me personally i wouldnt say i have a favorite but i am enjoying days alderamin on the sky beserk dgray man and rezero if that still counts as a new season though i must say im surprised at how much i kinda like servamp and regalia
anime,not_removed,im going to go with or aotk is has that super great mix of action military strats cute red heads and a not so op mc who still gets work done orange i cant wait to see how it plays out and how it still the story it is trying to convey also shout out to for being my guilty pleasure anime this season still have no idea why i find it so engaging to watch
anime,not_removed,carryover from last season still stuff only from this season
anime,not_removed,this season thunderbolt fantasy alderamin on the sky sweetness lightning
anime,not_removed,amanchu
anime,not_removed,days and orange
anime,not_removed,new game
anime,not_removed,my top for this season are macross and shit regalia is now fall anime new game then days sunshine and surprisingly ange vierge are good too
anime,not_removed,days i really like this anime and ive grown attached to some of the characters
anime,not_removed,days for new this season if were counting two cour macross delta is still killing it
anime,not_removed,shigofumi letters of the departed an underrated supernatural drama gem would reccomend edit whoops my apologies i didnt know that by favourite new anime was referring to the new series released lately i misread
anime,not_removed,why no one watch qualide code it has good quality of animation and plot best anime in the universe
anime,not_removed,orange is an easy pick for first place this season second favorites a little tougher maybe amanchu and its relaxing vibe
anime,not_removed,saiki kusuo no psinan is my favorite if only it was just a normal fulllength show tho it would have been much more popular
anime,not_removed,orange amaama to inazuma and days
anime,not_removed,shokugeki but considering its the sequel to one of my favorite anime it was bound to be my answer if we arent including sequels cheer danshi i legit want to go try male cheerleading now because of it
anime,not_removed,unsurprisingly its shokugeki no souma for me though im really enjoying kono bijutsubu as well
anime,not_removed,sweetness lightning with the kids alderamin of the sky solo tho i get pumped for shokugeki days when i see they are coming up though we just found puzzles dragons cross and weve all been playing the game as well its their new favorite of the season if we are counting continuations rezero is the most compelling watch it mixes many elements i love and i have no clue how the story will unfold which is exciting
anime,not_removed,it has to go to relife or rezero
anime,not_removed,im not going to count rezero since this is technically the second cour of the first season so my vote goes for everything fits so well together it doesnt just seem fluid it feels organic ive said this before but i really like its concept as a love story without romance also i think this show is a great example of the idea that shows dont need good worldbuilding or exposition as long as the story contained within them is grounded and strong frankly we dont know jack about the postwar world that planetarian has as its setting but we dont need to we know just enough to understand the characters which probably adds to the fluidity of it all
anime,not_removed,danganronpa
anime,not_removed,amanchu is easily the best airing show right now
anime,not_removed,since technically re zero is from last season i guess i cant pick it so ill go with relife
anime,not_removed,konodioda
anime,not_removed,rezero relife and hxh
anime,not_removed,welcome to the nhk
anime,not_removed,chikako is going surprisingly ok now however i wish sayuri childhood friend was more active but i doubt that will happen
anime,not_removed,berserk ftfy
anime,not_removed,why would anyone downvote this
anime,not_removed,yeah i liked sayuri too
anime,not_removed,some kids knows no art still my fav anime
anime,not_removed,bakamonogatari ep and the final episode of death parade did the playing of the oped perfectly during a scene ngnl changed the op during one episode that was fantastic
anime,not_removed,another good one would be s which is a flashback of sorts that explains homuras groundhog dayesque time travelling powers fittingly the op only happens at the end and is used as the ed pretty cool actually
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,my favorite example httpsmymixtapemoeghxgzkwebm also the sfx versions of the first jojo openings are fucking sick with the stardust crusaders ops version just being too good for words
anime,not_removed,the rezero thing is actually really common another example i can think of is i believe fatestay night ubw episode or where s illya died and they played ring your bell as the ed otherwise gakkou gurashi does this really well too
anime,not_removed,its always funny when gintama changes up its op sometimes its for the laughs and sometimes its to make it more epic also jojo stardust crusaders season did that perfectly
anime,not_removed,without any spoilers the music just adds way more to it
anime,not_removed,one i can think of right now would be the last episode of the melancholy arc for the suzumiya haruhi series the op did not play until the last few minutes probably signifying something something hahas
anime,not_removed,kekkai sensen last episode op played at just the right moment
anime,not_removed,symphogear takes whole gimmick with opseds to next level by playing op as ed and making it start earlier during climatic moment all the tropes at once ping pong girls went with something different and in ep before a fuckin hype match op plays normally and then is interrupted by upvotechan talking about how best she is really nice trick to boost the hype power in already full of hype show
anime,not_removed,nagi no asukara the ed transitions are the best ive ever seen and gives you chills every time anohana was pretty good too in terms of what you are talking about slight spoilers
anime,not_removed,surprised toradora hasnt been mentioned yet episodes and all use the ed iirc and its used a couple of times before that as well the op although it never directly overlaps is also strategically used to break sections of the episodes not just slapped onto the beginning which i appreciate as well i believe episode or doesnt have the op kick in until a third of the episode
anime,not_removed,anohana uses that in a lot of episodes

anime,not_removed,oh yeah that ngnl example is exactly what im talking about changing things to build up tension or defy our expectations is always pretty awesome when done correctly
anime,not_removed,ngnl changed the op during one episode that was fantastic httpsmymixtapemoeedbjaxwebm httpsmymixtapemoepwcdxxwebm
anime,not_removed,wow that was really nice
anime,not_removed,that second one simply superb animation is gintama made by ufotable or kyoani
anime,not_removed,i really like that rezero example because it is not the ed music thats playing but something completely different and also the image itself is beautiful it really does look like the end of a kurosawa film
anime,not_removed,yuitears
anime,not_removed,shaft just cant resist doing characterfocused ops apparently
anime,not_removed,like i said its the same thing for ubw they had a different animation and song for only that episode
anime,not_removed,oh cool i havent watched any of that series so i thought ring your bell was just the normal ed
anime,not_removed,ore wa pumpkin gundam
anime,not_removed,sorry for being a noob but wheres this from looks pretty cool
anime,not_removed,its the gundam i think its probably the most recognizable gundam in the series most notably the i used for my carving
anime,not_removed,it looks like a gundam super deformed
anime,not_removed,this angle makes it seem smaller than it actually is the thing is huge in person or tall
anime,not_removed,if its gundam its sd not chibi

anime,not_removed,i read promo as porno
anime,not_removed,wow she does look unhinged i love it looks like i need to finally watch the first vivid
anime,not_removed,that artlooks different from the vivid manga and nice to see that they meant oct
anime,not_removed,a street battle show taking place during vivid or rather vivid with a different protagonist i admit i didnt know i wanted this lets hope tsuzuki learned something
anime,not_removed,an elementary school kid refers to herself with httpwwwwapediacomlanguagejapanesepersonalpronounsshtml its a bit weird heh
anime,not_removed,too high five
anime,not_removed,thats cuz sevenarcs is doing it again not like they did with vivid
anime,not_removed,high fives
anime,not_removed,i think ping pong offers a good counter to this sentiment not that i necessarily believe its wrong altogether just like sakuma sometimes our dreams dont work out and thats okay
anime,not_removed,is that spikes english va
anime,not_removed,a sequel to there most famous promo fucking hyped
anime,not_removed,original truly the original promos are all insane
anime,not_removed,this video perfectly shows the reason why a lot of people does not like dubs
anime,not_removed,you mean steve blum yeah
anime,not_removed,he always has been except for when toonami first begun
anime,not_removed,nostalgia this kept me going back when
anime,not_removed,im one of the rare dudes that prefers them certain lines are cheesy either way its just when theyre in japanese you cant take them in a certain way lol
anime,not_removed,for some dubs are a necessity would a dyslexic anime fan enjoy subtitles
anime,not_removed,to me hell always be the mahine world supreme overlord jerghingah
anime,not_removed,i like keeping up with current seasons and watching not so popular anime that dont get dubbed so i watch exclusively subs now days not because i dont like dubsits more that i like watching whats accessible to me
anime,not_removed,some dubs are legitimately good its also interesting to see what choices the translatorsinterpreterswriters made
anime,not_removed,yeah ive actually been watching more subs lately for those reasons exactly
anime,not_removed,barring shows that have essentially no ending because of the source material i think many writers are just incapable to write solid endings since they just never thought that far they have the premise setting and conflict in mind at the beginning but not the conclusion and because of that they have to think of some midway without a lot thought also many writers had to change their endings because the showmanga got more popular the author of aot for example had to change the ending of his work due to the rise of its popularity
anime,not_removed,original anime and anime based on completed source material usually get decent endings unfortunately so many shows adapt releasing mangalight novels and the studios always end up having to decide between an anime original ending or holding off in hopes a second or third season gets greenlit that practice kinda irritates me even though i know the purpose of the anime is to promote the source material theres multitudes of great shows that have crappy endings or are going to be left incomplete indefinitely and that sucks just a quirk of the genre i guess
anime,not_removed,youre not wrong but a lot of good anime also have great a ending
anime,not_removed,to be fair aldnoahzero isnt a good anime everything that happens in the series was a pretty good indicator that thered be a shitty ending as far as btooom goes it sold poorly so it wasnt given a proper ending and i think anime like that doesnt count its also why i kinda watch less and less newer anime theres no point in getting invested when the anime wont ever tell the full story
anime,not_removed,what was particularly bad about the golden time ending unless you are just salty about the ships i dont think it was bad about btooom i think they expected to make a however the manga only recently surpassed enough contact to make a and the anime didnt sell that well
anime,not_removed,its easy to make someone excited about something harder to pay it off death note in particular had not only a shit ending but a drawn out shit ending on the flip side stuff that left me satisfied were fmab your lie in april steinsgate and kill la kill
anime,not_removed,yea like of all the anime i have watched have bad endings i can only name about with great endings and with good ones
anime,not_removed,death note was pretty infamous for this the last episode was completely not in line with how the rest of the series progressed
anime,not_removed,i watched aldnoah a few months back on netflix and thought it was alright but i havent been able to be bothered to go watch the next season they put on there you want bad endings try these akame ga kill fantastic series but had a garbage ending once the anime ended i picked up the manga series and have been enjoying it for quite some time but now the manga chapters are ending just like the anime did and that makes me so mad mirai nikki the entire series itself was a very meh series i actually only watched the first two episodes and then the last two episodes and had my roommate fill me in on the gaps because i like the idea of the story but they didnt execute it worth shit the ending was so bad but i have to give them credit because the ova that they released was awesome totally made up for the bad ending this last one is the worst ending ive ever seen to any anime ever i was totally devastated when i watched it a few weeks ago im still not totally over that yet rokka no yuusha i watched this a few weeks ago and i was heavily enjoying it i had started it and made it to the end of episode and i was like yeah this series is so cool and then i watched episode and and i was sitting there for a while thinking uhhhhhhhh but then i watched episode it literally made the entire story that they had gone through the past episodes mean absolutely nothing it was like spending years looking for a needle in a haystack and then getting another one and throwing it back in it was the worse ending ive ever seen in any anime ever everything was up until episode thats where everything left just like my dad
anime,not_removed,im fairly new to anime compared to a lot of people on here but i think that the issue with anime endings is that its pretty difficult to establish a premise progress the plot and wrap it up in a satisfying way when you have to deal with cour seasons and the uncertainty of getting renewed this is one of the perks of sol anime since sol series dont ever really have to end i believe its part of the reason i tend to rate sol higher than other genres since most sol shows dont do the whole fuck around leave a bad taste in your mouth endings id say of my completed anime have lost at least a point due to unsatisfactory endings
anime,not_removed,a major reason so many endings suck is because the source material frequently manga light novels is serialized meaning they are published on a regular schedule a serialized format gives incentive for an author to keep the story going for a long time because that way the paychecks keep coming in but when it comes time for an ending its usually because the publisher pulls the plug on the series and thus the author has to scramble to come up with something that will at least provide some kind of closure to the story which is tough to pull off especially for a longrunning series because there are so many plot threads and character arcs to account for for animeoriginal shows endings often feel lackluster probably because the producers are hoping the show will get popular enough to get renewed for a second season so they try to end things on an open note a great example of this is psychopass both seasons and the movie which concluded its story arcs well but each one leaves the door open for a sequel a horrible example is aldnoahzero where the writers seemed like they were changing every other episode and throwing darts on a board to determine how can we change slaines characterization next episode you see this happen a lot with american tv shows castle just ended recently on a very sour note after seasonsgo to rcastletv and youll see a ton of threads complaining about the ending
anime,not_removed,endings done right steinsgate nice happy statisfying ending ttgl by far my favourite ending ever just perfect in so many ways ping pong topped everything off nicely and the song in the final match was httpiimgurcomiazjwlujpg
anime,not_removed,my problem with anime endings is that there is nowhere near enough kissing even for anime where ending on a kiss would be the perfect ending eg toradora golden time it doesnt happen
anime,not_removed,watching aldnoahzero and was suprised how terrible the last half was what part of on mal made you expect a great ending am i the only one who thinks a lot of good anime have mediocre endings no but i think many series try to differentiate themselves from the crowd by doing something unexpected with the ending and often times it falls flat but i can name almost as many where they hit a homerun with the same strategy i think its a very american ideal that everything needs to have a perfect disney ending
anime,not_removed,usually bad ending means that the anime is simply unfinished recently there are a lot of anime adaptations of manga and light novels that are still ongoing so they simply cant end it properly and the anime works only as a some kind of commercial for them other thing is when they dont have enough budget to make long anime and rush ending in a crazy way charlotte or erased though i heard some people that said that anime ending of erased was better and the last case is when anime starts good but then suddenly the plot and characters gets worse etc for no other reason than bad writing no game no life chaoshead sword art online of course there can be more examples but i think those are the most common ones
anime,not_removed,berserk was great but screw the ending one of the better read the manga shows sure but i hate it when they say read the manga i dont want to and im not going to
anime,not_removed,also many writers had to change their endings because the showmanga got more popular yeah i got a similar feeling about a manga that i was reading where it was probably intended to be a short story but got serialized due to popularity had to basically stall the ending until they were told that they are not going to be serialized anymore at which point they decided to end the initial plot line that started the entire thing i am guessing this is how filler for long running shows must feel for people
anime,not_removed,really i thought the author changed aot bc the ending was leaked and was changed to make it unexpected what was the ending
anime,not_removed,so tldr dont hate the player hate the game
anime,not_removed,true but most anime i have really enjoyed have had lackluster endings there were a handful of amazing endings but other than that most are terrible some average at best your lie in april has one of the best endings so far same with anohana
anime,not_removed,i liked golden time all of it found no problem with the ending either what is the issue
anime,not_removed,i really liked death notes ending i enjoyed near and mello more than most i guess
anime,not_removed,if you dont mind me going off topic ive got a question about your lie in april on one hand i know practically nothing about the show i dont know the characters the setting or any events i think maybe theres music on the other hand given the number of threads your lie in april comes up in and the general comments that arent a direct spoiler make me think i know exactly whats going to happen will that detract from my experience at all for context s from what i gather the main heroine dies at the end no need to confirm or deny said speculation just to give you an idea of what im talking about
anime,not_removed,death notes anime ending sucked balls but i did like the manga ending quite a bit
anime,not_removed,what the last episode wasnt in line whit the rest or the series the ending of the series was the only acceptable solution to the series all it was leading to this ending and it was the point of the story the only thing that it was not good was that it didnt adapt the ending of the manga completely that ending was just right
anime,not_removed,just like my dad um
anime,not_removed,i finished akame ga kill awhile back and i agree it was a the last few episodes were terrible the last episode did not end well at all it almost made ruined the whole thing for me
anime,not_removed,magikano may have been the worst swingandamiss
anime,not_removed,the material is long af tho i dont think there is anything other than something like one piece that would ever get so much content turned into an anime nowadays the whole point of anime for a while was to advertise the manga anyway lol most are never intended to finish the whole story
anime,not_removed,but iirc the manga author realized the popularity of the show and decided to continue writing the story actually it was an anime original the manga happened after
anime,not_removed,iirc s he planned to kill everyone off to end it
anime,not_removed,well ive felt the same way about a lot of shows but i feel like im just sad that theyre over finishing bebop or lagann or most other shows i just realize that im not going to watch them any more i took my sweet time watching owarimonogatari because that was it for the series excluding koyomi and kizu
anime,not_removed,way to spooky i could barely make it through without feeling chills through my bones
anime,not_removed,mmm i dont think it will too much theres no twist that comes out of nowhere but youll probably pick up a few hints easier than others id recommend it alot and while there is a fair amount of classical music in it which i enjoyed even though im not a fan thats not the focus its a romance drama so if thats your thing youll love it probably my fav of
anime,not_removed,yeah i dont think it will detract at all the show itself gives you all the hints before the stuff happens im not one for romance stuff but i massively enjoyed your lie in april give it a shot
anime,not_removed,i dont believe it will youll definitely notice the flags that pop up a lot clearer than most but its still a really worth the watch i think that if thats the kind of thing youre looking for than maybe itll take away from the emotional aspect of the show but theres so much else to enjoy about it that i think youll be okay
anime,not_removed,i felt like the behavior of certain characters you know exactly who i mean didnt match at all with their behavior previously and what their characters would do which made the ending unsatisfactory nobody likes a at the end of a story unless its a plot twist it came across as lazy writing
anime,not_removed,that got unexpectedly dark
anime,not_removed,i love akame ga kill im so sad the manga is going that same way
anime,not_removed,haha in that case i recalled incorrectly thanks for the correction
anime,not_removed,hmm i guess thatd be fine if it was clever and well written deaths not just random meaningless deaths
anime,not_removed,no thats not it he said in an interview that he was planning to kill off a specific character without naming names but that this character became unexpectedly popular and he had to rethink the ending s it was probably levi he was gonna axe until he saw the legions of fangirls
anime,not_removed,if you mean light than his behavior was just as it should have been he called him self god and when he realised that is not this was the only natural outcome and thats the story or death note the path leaded to this conclusion
anime,not_removed,oh my bad
anime,not_removed,i dont think so with how convicted he was in every past episode its a let down for him to finally go huh i guess i was wrong and just break down imagine watching die hard or a new hope and at the very end the bad guy just says oh i guess i was wrong in doing these things k bye theres no actual confrontation no conflict nothing bad guy gives up his side end of story its really anticlimactic
anime,not_removed,death note is a story of a guy who tried to became something big that at the end he couldnt handle he did so much wrong for a long time so the punishment was bound to come when he found himself powerlessbecause he never was that powerful only thing left was to brake under everything he did the manga ending did this just right and there was monologue from one character that explained this situation very well
anime,not_removed,the entire subplot of death parade ie things that characters talked about that seemed to have no relevance to death parade were talking about death note madhouse animated both death note and death parade ultimately its mostly just an easter egg though the cute jpop star is voiced by light yagamis va as well i dont remember what the last three scenes were specifically so someone else will have to help you with that
anime,not_removed,the fanart looks really cool for this
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,goodbye ai
anime,not_removed,time to vote for smug face echizen one more round

anime,not_removed,your mal is so pretty
anime,not_removed,flattered
anime,not_removed,you ever hear an opinionreviewanalysis on something and its so rife with misunderstanding that you cant help but feel pity for that person to be able to misconstrue things to that depth this is it kyonfacepalm
anime,not_removed,dio brando has no redeemable features and is in no way sympathizable yes that is the point
anime,not_removed,the general rule for jojo is give it up to episode if you still dont enjoy ep then ya feel free to drop it
anime,not_removed,in general it seems like you have misconceptions about a few things for example youre disappointed that dio is a pure evil villain it sounds like you view complex motivations as a desirable trait in villains and that a simple villain is a bad thing this is not absolute many memorable villains in history are absolute assholes if you cant see that type of villain as a good villain then you arent even entering a conversation where you can discuss jojos strengths
anime,not_removed,sounds like you are expecting too much out of one episode i had the same feelings for dio when i first started the next few episodes made up for it imo
anime,not_removed,the first arc is a chore second arc is actually pretty enjoyable
anime,not_removed,theres a time skip after the first episode go watch episode and then come back if you still cant watch it
anime,not_removed,maybe you should watch more than the first episode well i would be saying this even at the one the first arc is by popularity the worst of all try it until episode dont skip it you wont understand almost anything of the plot until part
anime,not_removed,the series changes a lot later on id say if you didnt enjoy the first episodes just skip to episode and go back to earlier episodes later
anime,not_removed,i agree with you first time i watxhed jojo i was turned off even after giving like episodes a try but then i watched the currently airing part and it interested me enough to stay through the mediocre at best part dont let jojo fans mislead you this show definitely has its very rough moment s but so far part the end of part and part have been very much worth watching all i can say is it gets much better
anime,not_removed,you know what sure ill defend the show and talk about why i love it heck ill even defend the first episode the first episode is the classical tale of how one character completely changes the main characters life except for dio this involves stealing everything johnathan holds dear his familys love his friends his girlfriend and even his dog are subject to dios evil and all for purpose to show how gosh darn evil this son of a bitch is like all throughout the episode im yelling dammit dio why why are you so freakking mean is he a shallow character definitely but who cares about his motivations hes a villain his sole purpose is to make johnathans life miserable and he does that really really well so when johnathan bashes him in the face im nodding my head going yea get him the whole scenario in general is one that in no way seems farfetched sure its utterly dramatized to cause old shounens do that but the premise is something people with siblings or had that one prick in their class should no about losing his friends having his father prefer dio having his girlfriend kissed those are more or less the troubles youd expect a young schoolboy to have you cant talk to your dad or teacher about this he wont fucking care especially if he likes the other kid more whats he gonna say dad dio punched me in the eye by god how horrible when did this happen when we were boxing or dad dio kissed my girlfriend i dont care son daddy has business to take care of you can get revenge by kissing his girlfriend but he doesnt have one then laugh at him son just in general the episode is a rare piece for me its an old tale thats been done a million times before and after but the anime does it right and i was looking forward to the next episode to see how dio would be evil again before getting his teeth knocked out as for the series in general i can absolutely confirm it is not the type of anime that people just watch and convince themselves is good this is the type of anime thats so out there that you either love it for one of its many good points or just dont really get it ill assume youre in the latter camp but who knows maybe youll find something youll like
anime,not_removed,you gotta get to the second part first part is pretty good imo but i ibstantly loved the second part cause of joseph if you still dont like it drop it
anime,not_removed,parts drag on for far too long parts are really fun and actually keep you invested
anime,not_removed,being a despicable piece of shit of a villain is the exact point of dios character that being said if you really hate him not as a villain but as a character he doesnt appear for a while after part which is episodes there are a bunch of timeskips in this arc that may change things up for you too as for jojo jonathan has the least screen time of all the joestars in the show only the first episodes in ep a new joestar gets introduced i wont spoil but his personality is on a whole new level of interesting i think youd do best to keep watching until then only if you dont like him either is the show probably not for you treat the first eps as a prologue if you dislike it skip it but dont let it discourage you
anime,not_removed,jojo is show you either like or dont depends on your acceptance of what the show presents at least give it the privilege of the episode rule if you dont like it well you dont and thats that
anime,not_removed,you sound like a rational guy if so dont watch jojo
anime,not_removed,i think one of the things that bothers you about this first season is the mc jonathon joestar is drastically different from the other jojos that will eventually be revealed to you while he has the appearance of a strong young man in reality he is weak naive and his intelligence is lacking as well this can most likely be attributed to his ritzy upbringing and a lack of having to work in the early days of his life lets just say that after the twists and turns of the first season you will be introduced to a cunning comedic and cocky jojo who will take you for your first truly bizarre adventure one of the things that drives this series and keeps it from becoming stale is the development of a new mc moving into a new season i feel that with a new mc focused in each season and how the powers are reexplained to the audience and new characters it allows for each season to be watched standalone except stardust crusaders which really should be watched part then part so honestly if you arent feeling the original try jumping straight into stardust crusaders or diamond is unbreakable and see if the change in pace is more to your liking
anime,not_removed,so jojo is split up into a number of parts in fact the first part is generally considered the worst and is essentially a story of absolute good vs absolute evil part starting at episode is the part that gets people hooked on the series the series is great for its extremely creative fights id try and push to episode unless you find it completely unwatchable
anime,not_removed,keep watching
anime,not_removed,dont take jojo seriously and see it as a comedy first
anime,not_removed,oh boy i watched the first episode of something really popular time to give my super well thought out opinion because im an expert and people will care about it this guy when watching the first episode of a part long series thats still on going
anime,not_removed,uh thats four hours of screen time if a show needs more time than a lord of the rings film to get me into it that shows got a problem
anime,not_removed,i cant see them as a good villain because theyre not actually a character at that point theyre a prop an object to be used for little more than pushing the story along and i require at least a modicum of depth to a character if im going to tolerate their bullshit hes literally the same tier of character as butch the bully from the cool cat yms reviews evil to be evil might as well be an endtable that has some mean things written into it
anime,not_removed,speedwagon is never a chore
anime,not_removed,mind expounding upon that suggestion
anime,not_removed,actually it was hey guys everyone said this was good and i watched the first episode it was really bad heres what i found bad about it is the rest of it really bad or should i keep watching dont try to shape my words and intent to better suit your victim fantasy you butthurt fanboy
anime,not_removed,its a shounen manga from so part isnt too great at times part episode onwards is a bit closer to the quality of the rest of the series but it really just gets better as it goes on that being said i thought part was still fantastic even though i dropped it for over a year or two after the first episode
anime,not_removed,well think about it like this if you really end up enjoying jojo you will get eps second arc plus eps third arc and eps fourth arc of enjoyment which equals eps this equals minutes about min per ep which equals about hours of enjoyment sacrificing hours for cant be so bad right
anime,not_removed,thats basically the majority of anime and if an anime has an amazing first ep its more likely to disappoint you and fall flat along the way i like slow starting shows bc they always get better well at least the ones ive watched
anime,not_removed,interesting things happen in ep and
anime,not_removed,the first arc is only episodes long and is a pretty enjoyable classic battle shonen the second arc improves exponentially and improves upon everything in the first arc phatom blood is not bad its just the least good arc in jojo the style and presentation of everything in the first episode should sell you on the series even if youre kinda shocked by it
anime,not_removed,except it wasnt even bad you are just being contrarian there are a lot worse things than the first episode of jojo if someone told you that one of your favorite shows was bad when it clearly isnt and some random guy who literally watched one episode thinks he knows everything is posting this shitpost of course you gonna make a comment about how pompous this guy is and wtf is a victim fantasy supposed to be lmao i like the show i dont care if you think its bad i just think its ridiculous that someone can judge something based on the first episode and then make a long ass post about it thinking his opinions so important its like someone watching the first minutes of game of thrones and asking if the rest of it is this bad you are so stupid yesh
anime,not_removed,i would argue against that in fact id say with the average cour being episodes these days taking episodes to get off the ground would be a death sentence for most everything cowboy bebop trigun evangelion ttgl and most other anime that get as much acclaim as jojo didnt take episodes to grasp their viewers in fact i feel like i was hooked from episode with most of them
anime,not_removed,i mean dont get me wrong the art style and animation are great theyd have sold me if the characters themselves didnt feel so badly written
anime,not_removed,you learn to enjoy it more once you embrace the ridiculousness
anime,not_removed,keep in mind the first part was written in and was more or less ripping off fist of the north star the author himself has said that he would do things differently with jonathan if he wrote it today hes not really supposed to be this super great character
anime,not_removed,people are saying watch until the second arc because the first arc is more or less a prolugue part has a new main character a new setting and a new plotline
anime,not_removed,all in all im glad is being enjoyed i have been really enjoying it and i hope it can spread to more people
anime,not_removed,well i waited hoping that fune wo amu would have gained enough traction to break into the top for real many more people need to be giving fwa a shot attention to detail in movement downtoearth characters and episode threes s newly introduced romance angle make it one of the best anime this season i suspect it is mainly due to the availability of it that is indirectly turning people away
anime,not_removed,the gayer yuri on ice gets the higher its ranking coincidence
anime,not_removed,im still sad to see ajin so low
anime,not_removed,sad to see kiss him not me so low for me it is without a doubt the best comedy since konosuba no scorching ping pong girls is also disappointing
anime,not_removed,kiss him not me getting a bump is nice but a bit sad to see go down after episode was its best episode so far
anime,not_removed,so whatre peoples opinions on nanbaka i havent been hearing much about it
anime,not_removed,hmm not much movement haikyuu needs to be though for pulling amazing episodes week after week after week obviously ep is not included but still
anime,not_removed,ajin and nanbaka are severely underrated based on this ranking
anime,not_removed,im surprised nastume go is so low i guess being the season makes it hard for people to get into it i never expected it to be amazingly good but its a solid show that wont be bad
anime,not_removed,more people really need to watch fune wo amu though this season is just amazing in general but i really think fune wo amu is being criminally underwatched
anime,not_removed,i wonder why nanbaka is so low its pretty fun to watch the inmates fuck with hajime each time guess people dont like pure humor and traps around every corner literally and males that look like females
anime,not_removed,i am really enjoying nanbaka and am quite sad to see it so low on this list i think more people should give it a try
anime,not_removed,keijo being on top of all the sports anime in karma and exclamation mark count pleases me
anime,not_removed,are there any must watch or underwatched shows this season other than sequels and no lion edit im so mad no one suggested flip flappers and im watching it now and its so awesome
anime,not_removed,a could of my favorite shows are near the bottom of the list girlish number and kiss him not me i wish the sub for girlish number would come out
anime,not_removed,im surprised udon no kuni no kiniro kemari didnt make it to the top definitely my favourite sol of the season not surprised that vivid strike didnt make it though
anime,not_removed,the future is not looking good for for magical girl raising project not here nor on mal nor s for the magical girls themselves
anime,not_removed,the mouths are weird but everything else is amazing
anime,not_removed,i wish the threads werent so mean fedup loving the sisters though
anime,not_removed,if youre not familar with sailing the high sea then u not gonna watch it in time so yeah
anime,not_removed,as the person who to generate some interest in this show before it aired i have to concur people always complain about how generic and repetitive anime is yet shows like this that dont feature meta jokes pantsu explosions excessive suffering or moeblobs get absolutely zero love consider how little interest there is in these types of grounded anime its a wonder they get made at all though im glad that they do
anime,not_removed,nah its just good no homo
anime,not_removed,im sure a lot of people including myself are waiting for it to be released on netflix before watching it the lack of any legal simulcasts hurts its viewership
anime,not_removed,its definitely hurt by the difficulty of obtaining it i basically put the show on hold when i looked for it several days after the first episode and could only find shitty subs translated from russian
anime,not_removed,id have to say this season of ajin is killing it im really enjoying the pacing and satou is too bad ass
anime,not_removed,if its even on the list then its in the top half right
anime,not_removed,sad to see kiss him not me so low id watch it if the powers that be deemed us poor brits worthy enough for it
anime,not_removed,i have minor problems with khnm i love the mc but the guys are quiet annoying always going on pack with her everywhere so far i only tolerate smooth glasseskun and greenheaded guy
anime,not_removed,i just looked up kiss him not me on mal this show looks hilarious
anime,not_removed,its still rather chaotic and a lot of people dont like that i hope it fits like a puzzle piece in the end though
anime,not_removed,kinda falls into the same category as durarara for me there are some interesting characters but there are just too many characters in total and the focus is often on the less interesting ones i dropped durarara somewhere during the second season i still have high hopes for
anime,not_removed,character designs are extremely fabulous i wish more anime did this humor isnt particularly refined but its good if its your kind of thing overall im liking it more and more over time
anime,not_removed,i like it a lot so far im shocked to see how low it is because the first episodes are great
anime,not_removed,its great theres a episode coming up where it may become much more popular depending how well they animate it
anime,not_removed,as a naysayer i thought it was cheesy and ended up dropping it after episode just wasnt a fan of the comedy or any of the characters
anime,not_removed,yeah absolutely tsuki killed it this week
anime,not_removed,its actually surprises me how its not stomping its competition this match is fucking lit
anime,not_removed,ajin suffers due to accessibility
anime,not_removed,i gave it a try and dropped it after eps it wasnt bad but it really didnt give me a hook the jokes didnt land and overall i was getting bored
anime,not_removed,i tried it too and dropped the humor was so strange
anime,not_removed,haikyuu will take its rightful place as top sports anime as of episode and the moment should keep it above edit this is a controversial statement seriously haikyuu got a score of with episode while keijos score is falling bit by bit haikyuuz established fanbase means it wont drop below a certain score and having read the manga i know how good its going be this season if hype episodes are what cause jumps in score then haikyuu is going to have a lot of momentum from here also keijo might be good but as far as sports anime go haikyuu is among the best
anime,not_removed,fune wo amu is a must watch imo flip flappers is getting a lot of praise its hard to say whats good because this season is very niche focused so its more a question of whether you enjoy that niche
anime,not_removed,imo is super underrated because people didnt like the watermelon boobs and the pacing of the first episode the directing in is really good
anime,not_removed,fune wo amu and girlish number are both underrated fune wo amu severely so id definitely recommend you give both a try edit accidentally spelled fune wo amu as fume wo amu
anime,not_removed,girlish number is a great dark horse this season
anime,not_removed,id say drifters its a whole lot of stylish action and men doing men things
anime,not_removed,keijo if you can suspend disbelief personally i dont have a trouble with this and focus more on the message than on the form so for example some people complain that the characters dont have spines but i focus on what the characters try to do instead so it doesnt disrupt my willing suspension of disbelief deal with the fanservice the fanservice in matches isnt distracting or cringey most of the times looking at you tit hypnotism because the characters look like theyre putting effort into their attacks i think that there are some ecchi scenes that arent in the manga but removing it wouldnt make much difference imho since there would still not be enough room for world building characterization buildup for character development such as the hip toss arc thats shorter in the anime because theres only episodes available to adapt chapters keep in mind that in the mangaanimes universe surprisingly the vast majority of the male audience and none of the male staff so far dont sexually objectify the players in the definition of being primarily seen as means to provide sexual arousal theyre seen enjoying good matches or being frustrated at times irritated when their chosen player the ones theyve betted in doesnt play well enjoy the comedy style some of the special attacks and training that make sense in the universe but seems ridiculous by the readerswatchers personally i enjoy keijo because of its characters even most of the more characterized opponents who havent appeared again decision making intense matches its not a contest of who has the best special ability expect lots of regular attacks too varied playing fields and the more calmer moments with training comedy plot advancement and characterizationcharacter development
anime,not_removed,i dropped it after the first episode each shoe of its ilk i watch i find myself less interested in and udon provided me with nothing of interest
anime,not_removed,from what i see there is still quite the dislike for this series everywhere and people opinion about what type of series this anime is are still fixed quite a few judge this very quickly and written it off base on generalized info like a few manga pages or tvtropes info some come in with certain expectations but what they got is something else different not what they expected thus written it off and left really ill be happy if people can see this for what it is by the end
anime,not_removed,i havent seen much love for magical girls in quite some time im not sure if this is because of a lack of quality anime or if people are just tired of the genre
anime,not_removed,there was a bit of a movement among the magical girl fanbases to attack it as many predicted it would be the most talked magical girl due to the edge instead of stuff like flifla and izetta even though izzy isnt exactly a mahou shoujo it is just very near the zone i took my part in it sharing criticism i found to be valid in the hype threads and it was my true opinion of the show and all that but there was definitely an effort take it down while praising other stuff
anime,not_removed,i think its intentional i read somewhere that they are supposed to look like open wounds or something
anime,not_removed,wait but arent you the one being mean to rei every thread always callin him creepy and stuff csikon
anime,not_removed,consider how little interest there is in these types of grounded anime its a wonder they get made at all here is in japan its ranked yuri haikyu hibike fune edit its but ranked
anime,not_removed,people always complain about how generic and repetitive anime is exactly i love moe ecchi and comedy in my anime so much it hurts but watching an anime like fwa that doesnt have that kind of material that goes against the typical anime formula lets us know that anime doesnt have to rely on its usual tropesideascrutches to be meaningfulfunintriguing consider how little interest there is in these types of grounded anime and thats why we must try harder to get people to understand just how great the anime is at least right now for it could easily take a nosedive at any point i dont foresee that happening but stranger things have happened
anime,not_removed,its been picked up by a decent group now thankfully
anime,not_removed,i only tolerate smooth glasseskun and greenheaded guy emm i dont think those are characters in that show you are probably talking about who i dont think has used glasses and if he did it was once and the walking life hack that already won who if you like is because you watched s and know it is actually a girl p
anime,not_removed,its so much fun
anime,not_removed,its fantastic
anime,not_removed,as we all should be
anime,not_removed,its still rather chaotic and a lot of people dont like that i guess but i found the first episode incredibly fun so i guess its just a style that works for me honestly the show is just climbing my ranking of this season as it goes on it may not be the best thing since slicedzero but it constantly grabs me and seeing all the little hints i missed just gets me more excited for whats to come
anime,not_removed,its still rather chaotic and a lot of people dont like that kinda like concrete revolutio then
anime,not_removed,its been a leisurely walk in the park compared to that mess of a first episode haha i hope it all comes together two but i doubt it will deliver
anime,not_removed,if it turns out to be as good as durarara id be ecstatic
anime,not_removed,i guess im part of a niche then i honestly thought nanbaka would be really popular
anime,not_removed,you seriously overestimate us here at ranime friend
anime,not_removed,idk keijos episode was probably their best episode so far aswell i think it might still top haikyuu
anime,not_removed,its the kind of show you have to stick with to really enjoy im willing to bet that by the time it all comes together its going to be a lot higher and much more wellregarded
anime,not_removed,well that was a little long and thanks for writing it first of all after years of watching seasonal anime it made me disgust fanservice a lot the kind of anime that heavily focuses on fanservice ie konosuba overlord saekano i dropped them after seeing too much skin ill keep keijo on my mind and if it gains more popularity maybe just maybe id pick it up
anime,not_removed,flip flappers is one of the best this season and its super magical girl there was a big transformation sequence in episode three that was straight out of sailor moon
anime,not_removed,but there was definitely an effort take it down while praising other stuff but why its just incomprehensible to me that people choose to tear down a show just because they think other people will talk about it instead of simply letting it stand or fall on its own merits i remember this kind of thing happening with yuuki yuuna during the first episodes the commentariat was ripping it a new one on a regular basis yet once yuyuyu stood up on its own and started becoming a damn good show they all faded into the woodwork so personally i hope that mgrp turns itself around and shuts them up yet again im less confident in it being great than i was with yuyuyu but mgrp should still prove to be above average by the end of the season
anime,not_removed,i think rei himself is fine just the angles they show him in are pretty darn spooky
anime,not_removed,point taken have to wonder if it having a japanese best picture winning live action version generated a buzz domestically that didnt happen here because most of us dont pay attention to the japanese academy awards
anime,not_removed,i dont know why i thought mutsumi had glasseswell he is pretty cool to me about the latter i was talking of the one who makes the most moves with serinuma i think it was yusaki or something
anime,not_removed,im bound by masochism to watch it until the end so im sticking with it whether or not i like it i hope for the best though yuishrug
anime,not_removed,well keijo is beginning to drop into the where haikyuu recently just pushed i think thats going to be hard to turn around
anime,not_removed,best episode so far but still worlds away from s eastwest war keijo hype should go through the roof then the first episodes had necessary setup while still advancing the story adapting the manga parts that advance it so there wasnt much action i expect things to get hot starting on episode or if im underestimating the screentime needed for the arc that precedes the arc of awesomeness incarnate
anime,not_removed,i partially agree i think targetting a show in particular with the sense of killing the hype is bad especially with the planning some people did dont know much since i didnt take part into that on the other i think everyone has the right to dislike a show and to answer negatively to stuff being hyped up mgrp stood in an odd spot because it was really being hyped hard a month ago back in those seasonal expectation threads it had a drive higher than any other of the other femaleled shows people were ignoring stuff like flifla and instead saying things like i will check this one because it looks like madoka thus the salt rose and people started to target that show in specific
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,i dont think the award matters much for anime fans here imo its a noitamina being noitamina again
anime,not_removed,huh httpiimgurcomihtfgsujpg i always just took it as black hair x its yuusuke btw edit oh and you dont like nishima that is kinda surprising
anime,not_removed,after episode in the immortal words of snoop dogg i dropped it like its hot curious to see if i missed on something great but once i drop something i rarely ever look back maybe itll miraculously turn out amazing in the end
anime,not_removed,mgrp stood in an odd spot because it was really being hyped hard a month ago you think so i remember being very surprised how little hype there was grimdark magical girl battle royale sounded like something that would be straight up ranimes alley and i couldnt understand why nobody else seemed to be looking forward to it
anime,not_removed,well i guess it depends on the way you see it but the whole brigading idea was dumb so you might as well be right crap man this whole stuff is so messed up that now im starting to question if my feeling that mgrp was overhyped was not just people echoing the same opinion over and over again i still dislike it but im starting to feel bad for having commented in the seasonal expectation threads kenshinoro
anime,not_removed,i heard some rumors itll be a not sure though
anime,not_removed,episodes d
anime,not_removed,most likely and dont worry about one punch man coz it might actually get a second season but but its highly likely that it wont be this year
anime,not_removed,hopefully ive been hearing that one has been working hard on making new chapters just so bones has enough material to adapt into the anime
anime,not_removed,it doesnt even have chapters no way in hell
anime,not_removed,hey that would be a good reference to the title
anime,not_removed,please there wont be a new season for about years not with the slow production the author of the remake is doing to the series there supposed to be in this new arc but the author has been releasing very little pages in each chapters while filling it to the brim with filler scenes and mini arcs that slow the pacing down by alot weve been in this arc for more than a year but were just scratching the surface for whats to come in this arc
anime,not_removed,it was a joke
anime,not_removed,it does have over chapters but one probably wants to end it at chapter so he puts decimal numbers in his chapter numbering
anime,not_removed,were in a lull between seasons so we have to fill it somehow
anime,not_removed,we already have a rule against genitalia and female nipples in posts
anime,not_removed,fanart can be enjoyed by anyone you dont need so see a show to enjoy good artcute girls neither is discussion needed it looks good thats it
anime,not_removed,its what the people want
anime,not_removed,but what can you really do to reduce it nothing i can think of i hate the ranime front page too but i dont think theres much you can do about it
anime,not_removed,i check a lot of fanart even if i havent seen the show as long as its not spoilers you dont need to watch the show to appreciate the fanart
anime,not_removed,this submission has been removed meta posts belong in the monthly meta threads found have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,seasons lead to season specific fanart the next season is going to be filled with konosuba nsfw fanart we already have lots of it
anime,not_removed,but are you ok with nsfw fanart posts in the front page right now im actually ok with them even being straight up hentai if there was lesser of it instead i dont want them to be lesser nsfw but more like lesser of them being posted in general
anime,not_removed,seasons lead to season specific fanart of course they do but right now theres nothing airing the nsfw fanart isnt keeping episode discussions from the front page the next season is going to be filled with konosuba nsfw fanart probably and even more sfw fanart of that show and others id bet
anime,not_removed,i get annoyed with it but if its getting to the top that means the majority of people wanna see it most you can do is downvote the content you dont think belongs
anime,not_removed,broken link
anime,not_removed,remember that guy in gate who went across the barrier in search of catgirls that guy
anime,not_removed,any neet characters who watches anime
anime,not_removed,hotaro from hyouka or hikigaya from oregairu
anime,not_removed,everyone is a madao deep inside
anime,not_removed,lol yuri from yuri on ice because im really anxious and gay
anime,not_removed,watashi from the tatami galaxy
anime,not_removed,hohenheim in fmab no im not a philosophers stone but his struggles and feelings were very relatable for me
anime,not_removed,eishiro sugata heavens lost property prefered to live alone mindful of the underhanded trickery of women bored with this world obviously an ecchi kind of guy he stayed devoted to his science where i abandoned it though no black holes with sexy droid angles were going to open up here
anime,not_removed,tomoko kuroki tatsuhiro sato jun sakurada kaoru samura
anime,not_removed,konata izuni shinji ikari neptune
anime,not_removed,im not a big fan of nge but shinji was the first anime character that i could personally relate to
anime,not_removed,takemoto from honey and clover it hits too close to me sometimes tho
anime,not_removed,oumae kumiko and smile started off their series jaded and longing for reasons to keep moving forward
anime,not_removed,karasuma chitose
anime,not_removed,kouhei imamura
anime,not_removed,tanakakun from tanakakun is always listless come on hes just a lazy bastard thats like some ranimeirl material right here
anime,not_removed,machi from demichan wa kataritai
anime,not_removed,were both into computer programming and were both useless losers who cant do anything right and are surrounded by people who are better than us at everything and probably nicer to us than we really deserve
anime,not_removed,saruhiko fushimi hah who would have guessed i dislike my first name have a s shitty manipulative father not to the same degree as saruhikos but still im a loner and have treated my friends like saru did moving on without a word hoping that theyd follow but theyve never did
anime,not_removed,surprisingly saeko from highschool of the dead she and i went through a similar preanime for her thing namely finding out you really like beating people with a stick
anime,not_removed,shikamaru im lazy and i atleast believe that im smart
anime,not_removed,i find kamille bidans selfrighteousness towering arrogance and flair for unnecessary drama very relatable the only thing that could make him any more relatable is if there was a layer of self awareness to it all
anime,not_removed,yoh asakura from shaman king he is laidback and carefree and just wants to chill out and listen to music but he has a lot of things he is forced to do he goes through struggle and sacrifice but is always steadfast and forward thinking ive always related and admired that sense of calm and selflessness he always keeps a positive outlook on life and treats all livingnonliving things with respect and cherishes the friendships he makes doesnt stress the little things and has hope things are going to work out alright so i relate to that
anime,not_removed,american beaver from kemono friends being perpetually afraid to start because she might mess up
anime,not_removed,sato from welcome to the nhk also hachiman from oregairu to an extent not because im edgy but because he says alot of things i agree withm
anime,not_removed,to be fair most of us can relate to him
anime,not_removed,you wanted to be flooded with low class edgy jokes didnt you
anime,not_removed,arent you edgy
anime,not_removed,what about us surfacelevel madaos
anime,not_removed,i really doubt you share the same struggles
anime,not_removed,no were not like that but araragi is one of her favorite anime characters we laughed hard at that scene
anime,not_removed,shinji ikari i think he might be one of the most relatable characters ever deep down dont we all want to be loved and accepted
anime,not_removed,rawr
anime,not_removed,this post isnt whos the same as you its who do you relate to even then you dont have to share the exact same circumstances as someone to relate to them empathy and compassion can do that all by themselves and almost any good character has something you can relate to even villains good ones have a relatable motivation in some way eg shogo makishimas disconnection from his dystopian society or kiras desire to live his life quietly without interference or judgement but i picked hohenheim because i do have a strong personal connection to the feelings he struggles with hohenheim views himself as something inhuman unworthy of happiness or life i grew up in an environment that told me people like you arent people or deserving of life youre a freak and you should die as a result i told myself that a lot too it started when i was too young to question it further back than i can remember so when hohenheims going about how he believes he doesnt deserve what he has or that he will somehow infect or hurt the people he loves because who he is is fundamentally wrongirredeemable those are feelings that i relate with very powerfully because theyre thoughts i used to have too theyre feelings that i struggled with and im glad to say ive overcome i eventually i learned to accept myself and that im not less than anyone else i deserve happiness and life and i want to enjoy them i want to be with the people i love and i know that they wont be hurt by who i am because theres nothing wrong with who i am and thats the point hohenheim reaches at the end difference is he wasnt told he was inhuman by others different cause lots of different issues but a lot of feelings and thought processes that hit painfully close to home for me personally so when he says now believe it or not i actually want to go on living i guess i really am hopeless that was exactly where my head was about four years ago when i started to work through well everything except for me it wasnt too late when i realised that so thats why i relate to him more than pretty much any other character ive seen in anime
anime,not_removed,did you ask her to film a porno about you raping a girl you just met
anime,not_removed,forbiddenlove
anime,not_removed,thats what happens in no game no life
anime,not_removed,curious
anime,not_removed,or a second season of grimgar of fantasy and ash
anime,not_removed,rather get the accelerator story as he is character in that series or season of overlord or season of spice and wolf
anime,not_removed,index doesnt have pizzabutts and bunny suits
anime,not_removed,spice and wolf etc there is more money to be made elsewhere
anime,not_removed,i fucking love code geass but it just ended perfectly and i want spice wolf season
anime,not_removed,because they might still want you to wait for it probably didnt sell that incredibly well comparatively
anime,not_removed,im a bit late with answering but index is plausible according to a statement by miki the former editorinchief of the light novels at the beginning of this year he also told us to be patient its not even a year since then so please calm down with the exclamation marks
anime,not_removed,ummm not sure what that is
anime,not_removed,but it doesnt have a rail gun
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,it doesnt got misaka
anime,not_removed,and what a lifetime it was heres to another wait that doesnt sound right
anime,not_removed,dont forget the with transformer humming and everything
anime,not_removed,went in looking for was not dissapointed
anime,not_removed,surprised this had not been posted before but httpsredditcomdomainpowerlinesinanimetumblrcom says not maybe it has been linked in comments anyway the person who made this httpstwittercomwhitequark does all sorts of neat stuff on the internet and off like hardware reverse engineering
anime,not_removed,always noticed these in monogatari any reason why these are so prevalent
anime,not_removed,cm per second
anime,not_removed,i just spent an unhealthy amount of time staring at this and im not sure why
anime,not_removed,someone has a really weird fetish
anime,not_removed,im just surprised it isnt monogatari
anime,not_removed,ive always only half jokingly said power lines are a sign of a good anime thank you for this op
anime,not_removed,no jojo i am dissapoint
anime,not_removed,i feel like power lines and its poles give a ambience of being grounded in reality it really feels as if these locations are right around the corner from my own home sometimes
anime,not_removed,lines and contrast are important compositionally so urban art as a whole is riddled with this convenient source of lines and contrast monogatari is a special case though i think a lot of it has to do with studio shafts fascination with structuralarchitectural subjects theyre always going out of their way to occupy your eyes especially during long dialogues they also play an important role in emphasizing the countershaded art style where objects especially those more distant or near the edge of frame are seen to whiteout smoothly even though they shouldnt
anime,not_removed,when i last this to rararagi ucarlospicy a similar question and in response uoutdoorsexxx the landscapes and perception of the people in them are characteristic of the lead protagonists power lines show up a lot with the main man araragi particularly at night and at dusk if another character is the center of the arc then the world may look more open or with more people or more colorful i dont think there is anything more to them than that and i locations and characters are kinda tightly coupled in the mythology used in monogatari think about how s hachikuji had trouble finding closure by returning to her previous home because of urban renewal or how s godnadeko was stuck at that shrine even for the humans their houses and other surroundings define them to some extent s the araragi house koyomi has a nifty room gaharas apartment hanekawa sleeping in the hallway power lines are infrastructural they are threads connecting all of us tangling our plots together also they just look really cool and urban especially when contrasted with the beauty of natural landscapes or made into a kind of treelike growth themselves i also like ujustsomesluts dbtmliu
anime,not_removed,at first i thought that pwower lines were crazy in anime then i went in japan and now i know that they are just crazy in japan
anime,not_removed,i had assumed got a sequel but probably an error
anime,not_removed,that refers to the directors cut where they replaced the snow with rain
anime,not_removed,thats how many wallpapers per second there are
anime,not_removed,weird and very specific it must be a frame of anime and have power lines or power line support poles or lattices or rail overhead lines in it and have the name of the source included please also add the relevant tags more formally any wire that hangs and carries current or is built to carry current or any structure designed to support such a wire qualifies anything else does not i try to publish only visually distinct shots from the same source — httpspowerlinesinanimetumblrcomsubmit and with a surprising amount of material compared to others
anime,not_removed,video girl ai is a episode ova series from that i would like to get more exposure also theres punch line episodes that a lot of people dropped while it was airing but has an insane tone shift and multiple plot twists made the anime amazing in my eyes i wish more people would give it a chance
anime,not_removed,alright episodes can be done by next wednesday for sure i just did scryed today but i appreciate the recommendation and i can easily do that in the time i have afterwards ill look into punch line what genre are these btw check back next wednesday and youll find yourself a brief review of what we think on the channel here is the channel link httpswwwyoutubecomuserrecklessfyre i honestly thought itd be a good idea to talk about anime people may have missed so weve only pumped out videos for that segment so far but hope it gets some traction going
anime,not_removed,video girl ai falls in the magical girlfriend genre and punch line is just an awesome clusterfuck of genres some genres of punch line would spoil the ending but its definitely an action scifi paranormal superhero action ecchi psychological anime
anime,not_removed,ill see which ill do first ill get back with you soon
anime,not_removed,hey bud i finished punchline and will do the reviewrecommendation late today i didnt realize today was my dads birthday
anime,not_removed,im actually interested to hear someone elses opinion on it ive recommended it a lot but never see any feedback
anime,not_removed,oh it was definitely an interesting ride i have a lot to say about episodes im not home yet though so expect a late upload thanks for the recommendation
anime,not_removed,vids up should i start a new thread to try and spark a discussion on the anime video is here i just dont know if posting too many vids is considered selfpromotion but im down to discuss it with this subreddit if you feel its okay
anime,not_removed,i liked the vid a lot i subbed and am interested to see where you two go im glad i got you out of your comfort zone and im glad you enjoyed it a lot of people dropped it because of the lull in the middle and with it being one of my favourites i love to shout it out whenever i can if you havent shared the video on this sub i definitely will id like to see some discussion my one critique is an editing critique i would mute the gameplay audio if youre going to add a backtrack as you did but it was still good
anime,not_removed,thanks for the feedback and critique i lowered the gameplay audio to and assumed itd be alright but for future references ill set it to you are free to share the vid i shared it only to the punchline subreddit which is dead thanks for the sub ill look into your other suggestion and you can keep em coming if you like
anime,not_removed,oh yeah if you reference the vid in a thread just ume or however you beacon another user lol ill join in
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcommrbzynijpg i like how they went equalopportunity on those toetohead panning oh wow shots for all four mains httpiimgurcomuqdnwowjpg
anime,not_removed,i would love to see marins oneechan so that i can see who is behind these informations the influence she gives to marin and in turn marin to the other girls except cocoa is so alarming
anime,not_removed,ah back on track with a good episode how he won v volleyball is beyond me but a fun ep p
anime,not_removed,ayase is adorable with her hair in buns and that swim suit nice episode was a good one
anime,not_removed,you forgot the best screenshot httpiimgurcomsitelitjpg
anime,not_removed,that is the power of love
anime,not_removed,kek
anime,not_removed,itll make one man weep make another man sing
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,naruto one piece id say sword art online as a super popular anime and mentioning light novels cant hurt
anime,not_removed,whats the point on putting the spoilers tag in the title if you dont mention what are you spoiling
anime,not_removed,the title wasnt bleach when tite kubo decided to draw a story about shinigami this was before he drew the oneshot manga that appeared in akamaru jump the weapon wasnt a sword but a scythe only rukia had a scythe and the other characters used guns at that point the title was snipe as in sniper right before he started drawing he began to think that a sword would be better and realized he couldnt use snipe as a title anymore he began looking for a title that grasped the bigger picture shinigami are associated with the color black but it would have been boring to use black white on the other hand can suggest black as a complementary color so tite kubo chose bleach to evoke the impression of the color white basically because it sounds cool
anime,not_removed,huh i always thought that it was because ichigo bleached his hair
anime,not_removed,i always it was done on purpose for memes
anime,not_removed,and though this one does have a live action series already all deserve anime adaptations i dont really have an answer for the second one
anime,not_removed,i hope gets animated in the future it doesnt have enough material for an anime adaptation but i hope it does get one i just realised how long the name is anyway its a great comedy with psychological and romance in it
anime,not_removed,octave by akiyama haru best romance i have ever read and more than enough source material it would make a fantastic slice of lifedrama
anime,not_removed,i really want to get an anime adaptation its my second favorite romance manga i know theres a episode ova but i want an actual anime series
anime,not_removed,helck
anime,not_removed,im a bit worried about kaguya getting an anime imo certain things like how cute and the declaration of winnerslosers wouldnt really work that well in anime along with the fact that its nice that each chapter is nice and digestible but putting that into anime format would be difficult it could be web short series or it could be a sakamotoesque skit series to get over those shortcomings web short imo would fit it best seeing as sakamoto clearly suffers from the fact that the skits dont translate all that well into minute long episodes
anime,not_removed,thats true but i wouldnt mind if it gets a short or a fulllength series because seeing the characters animated would be glorious also it could a short similar to where it had episodes with each episode around including op ed
anime,not_removed,really cool philosophical take on mha channel is filled with quality stuff too
anime,not_removed,flavour of the season sell well things like rem emiliayuri toorusubaru old favourites also sell well things like fateharuhievangalion its more important than the prints look good
anime,not_removed,old favorites long running shows stuff like that narutodbzfairy tailone piece anything that has a pretty big following im sure nge would go over well popular shows in the west like cowboy bebop or fmab
anime,not_removed,this submission has been removed the content of your post does not appear to fit httpwwwredditcomranimewikiruleswikieverythingpostedheremustbeanimespecific have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,have you watched fatestay night unlimited blade works i can list a few animes that i really liked off the top of my head elfen lied rezero berserk hellsing black bullet i really recommend rezero
anime,not_removed,jojos bizarre adventure
anime,not_removed,no game no life
anime,not_removed,neon genesis evangelion good luck
anime,not_removed,have you watched kill la kill yet itll spoil you for good action
anime,not_removed,death note jojos bizarre adventure
anime,not_removed,dbz cowboy bebop flcl assassination classroom akame ga kill gurren laggen asterisk wars theres a ton just explore crunchyroll or netflix and pick random ones thats basically what i do i only sometimes hate my decision
anime,not_removed,evangelion monogatari series puella magi madoka magica kon love live giant killing syd kimi ni todoke
anime,not_removed,would recommend the aesthetically pleasing but me personally i havent seen the original yet
anime,not_removed,yes i watched ubw and i like more fatezero another besides rezero i hate the protagonist for being weak lol
anime,not_removed,i like the opening haha is the anime entertaining
anime,not_removed,no i dont like the animation but its good i like gurren lagann
anime,not_removed,is monogatari really worth it
anime,not_removed,i think i will watch it the fights look amazing how many episodes it have
anime,not_removed,berserk but its old hellsing ultimate is pretty good code geass is another
anime,not_removed,its really good op mc other world world revolved around games
anime,not_removed,yes its the most successful anime ever because its a very good anime
anime,not_removed,each ep is about a hour long i think and its eps if i recall correctly
anime,not_removed,watch the first minute episode and you will have your answer for why it has such low ratings its only slightly better than mars of destruction
anime,not_removed,incest gore yeah also its supposed to be horror but its mins per ep
anime,not_removed,its excellent you should watch it its aweful the suffering must be shared
anime,not_removed,welp that was pretty bad
anime,not_removed,i know thats what it is but is that all it is just some animation showing off incest and cannibalism
anime,not_removed,you asked for it man haha
anime,not_removed,im told that the source material is better
anime,not_removed,basically
anime,not_removed,its supposed to show off that incest angle with extremely violent imagery as a visual metaphor the manga pulls it off a bit better
anime,not_removed,i think that most all fight scenes in darker than black and to a lesser extent kara no kyoukai are very underrepresented in the once a week best fight scene threads
anime,not_removed,httpsmymixtapemoevdpwzgwebm
anime,not_removed,most fights from bleach some were kind of bad but many were really fucking entertaining until the final arcs in the anime
anime,not_removed,from gundam ms team
anime,not_removed,i dont hear it talked about much but the in moribito always struck me as pretty good and more realistic less flashy than a lot of other shows each blow has weight behind it and the fighters look like theyre exerting themselves
anime,not_removed,fatekaleid prisma illya gets some representation in these threads but often in the near the middleend of the the thread imo the franchise has had some fight scenes for a relatively smallunknown studio too bad i cant find bazett fight on a side note mecha fights are heavily underappreciated on this sub outside of the big three mech series mech series can have httpsmymixtapemoewkubklwebm
anime,not_removed,s taiga vs sumire
anime,not_removed,s that war game was brilliant
anime,not_removed,watch the entire fight with the zaku amazing i like mecha and sakuga in my fights
anime,not_removed,can i say pretty every fight in httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcngatovvdlu and httpsmymixtapemoeoxtuulwebm or is that a cheat i mean it is an old franchise and mechas so in general western fans dont care for these series pretty much every fight is superb and the animation quality is so far and beyond what can be achieved on tv it isnt even funny
anime,not_removed,birdy vs s nataru and just about any fight from that series really
anime,not_removed,easy the in katanagatari this is only a preview but the full length fight scene is one of the best ive ever seen
anime,not_removed,dunno how underrated these are but i havent seen these mentioned yet any fightaction scenes in is pretty incredible most of the fight scenes in kyoani shows like are very effects heavy and stylish with fluid movement even some of the battles in were very slick and i really thought the use of first person in that scene was cool the thing i think i like most about these fights is the facial expressions the studio is known for their mastery of character acting and i think thats something we dont see a lot in fight scenes the looks of surprise or shock or glee really communicates a lot bakemonogatari near the end of her arc is a standout example most monogatari series have at least one or two excellent choreographed and directed fights pretty much all of end of eva particularly where excellent sense of weight as they wrestle and heave enormous swords around ghost in the shell arise has some gots has masterlevel animation work pretty much throughout the franchise
anime,not_removed,probably most of the pretty cure ones and i am sure there is plenty more
anime,not_removed,everything in chaika all the fights were choreographed so well all the hits felt like they had impact and the characters felt like they were all bound by the same laws of physics and combined it more than makes up for the rushed ending
anime,not_removed,i enjoy and the conversation that they have right before it unfortunately i couldnt find a clip with the full conversation
anime,not_removed,i really liked the fight in episode of rokka no yuusha between adlet and the two tournament finalists his resourceful and kind of underhanded style was what kept me watching but it will probably stay underappreciated because s rokka no sales
anime,not_removed,ikki vs kirihara the fight alone is great but goes up a level with the additional buildupcontext the series itself is a bit underappreciated especially compared to its genre imo
anime,not_removed,the fights in prisma illya are all pretty great
anime,not_removed,i was shocked by how good the fight scenes in evangelion are s unit vs unit and asuka vs the massproduced eva units were both sickeningly brutal and instantly entered my list of favorites all of the fight scenes are great though even the ones that are just shinji vs angeloftheweek theyre short and simple but theyre so raw so savage and convey so much more emotional and physical weight than in any other show i can think of the fight scenes were a big part of what made eva so great to me and its an aspect of the series that i rarely see mentioned
anime,not_removed,the charging head forward into a garmillan armada
anime,not_removed,every single fight scene in etotama
anime,not_removed,i havent seen any mention to the fights in zetsuen no tempest whereas i think that the fight between mahiro and natsumura and s aika vs hakaze even if its totally onesided were great
anime,not_removed,in noein is one of my favorites
anime,not_removed,knights of sidonias fights look great they just show the scale of them really well ajin also has fairly good ones especially since its approach to fighting is fairly unique s since you can only win by capturing your opponent due to them being immortal characters tend to die easily a couple of times each fight
anime,not_removed,spoiler of bleach jigokuhen looks amazing
anime,not_removed,to answer my own question brutal and well animated
anime,not_removed,any hajime no ippo fights particularly ippo v sendo
anime,not_removed,in a series full of great fight scenes i always hear people talk about how much they didnt like s ryuuko vs the elite naturals election king of the hill we get some great character development and it really shows what ryuuko and senketsu are capable of when they combine their strengths i would really like to hear why people dont like these fights
anime,not_removed,not sure about underappreciated but the only ttgl fights people seem to mention here are the final battles thats kind of a shame since and are pretty great too
anime,not_removed,the fight scenes in of horizon seems to be underappreciated here the way their laws and physics and execution also they also felt unique that you cant see it on other series
anime,not_removed,recently nagare vs tora from ushio to tora was an amazing one
anime,not_removed,blade of the immortal had some really good fights especially s manji vs makie but unfortunately i could only find httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrmijkltosdk of it
anime,not_removed,i havent seen anyone mention fight scene in the second episode of here yet cant find a proper video so let me just describe the scene she is ambushed by a group of people in a building at night first she to confuse her enemies and get her eyes used to the dark then after dealing with the two lesser threats she switches the lights on to and get his eyes used to the light again while httpiimgurcomlxgpmelpng so she can still see well when she kills the light for the final time and gets a combat advantage over him this way its not that visually impressive overall but her tactic is communicated very clearly and is refreshingly well down to earth compared to what the insanely powerful espers and mages make of most of the fights in raildex definitely one of my favorite fights in the franchise
anime,not_removed,httpsdmaxfileroglrsmhfoozwebm fighting scenes are beautiful and imaginative furthermore everybody just knows fatekaleid liner prisma illya for its loli yuri ew and not the amazing fighting scenes
anime,not_removed,archer illya vs black saber in fkaleid is one of my favourite fights ever
anime,not_removed,from berserks golden age arc movies gut vs bazuso httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzyfzfpdosds
anime,not_removed,i still go back and watch bell vs that minotaur in is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon
anime,not_removed,everything in fateubw a lot people call them just flashy or whatever because there are a lot of effects but all of these effects are pretty complex and more expensive than traditional stuff they arent there to obscure anything or take away from the scene and yes servants are really fast during fights for a good reason but what a lot of people dont realize is that ufotable simply represented servant fights correctly according to descriptions and lore of source materials because servants are dozens of times faster and stronger than normal humans indeed fateubw has best representation of raw speed and strength of servants out of all fate adaptations ive often seen people criticize saying servants are teleportingskating whatever but that is perfectly in line with narration and shirous monologues because servants can just move that fast as to become a blur or even invisible to a human observer its even known that some servants can move at speed of sound so there things like sparks debris shockwaves is also straight from vn i wish there was more appreciation for the effort it took to portray fights properly
anime,not_removed,nearly every fight from towa no quon theyre some of the best choreographed fights ive ever seen
anime,not_removed,some of the fights in while not exactly huge on choreography or highly stylized were very tense and had back drop to add to it whether it was the look of it who was involved or the stakes behind it the one that stuck for a while with me was s ian killing his captain who raised him after his father was killed in the fire and joined the army
anime,not_removed,bento is the first thing i thought of also many gundam scenes
anime,not_removed,psycho pass movie has some great fights like
anime,not_removed,heres something no one else is going to mention the battle in the lake in armored trooper votoms between chirico and epsilon during the vietnam kunmen jungle war arc ive never seen anything like it in mecha and still havent
anime,not_removed,fatekaleid liner prisma illya episode saber alter vs s archer illya
anime,not_removed,im surprised nobodys said katanagatari yet the entire series is filled with beautifully choreographed fights
anime,not_removed,the entire precure series
anime,not_removed,shizuo fights in durarara i mean most of the time they ended up pretty quickly but it was entertaining as hell to see shizuo dragging a bikecarroad sign into the fight and stomping everyone
anime,not_removed,the mecha action scenes in majestic prince are pretty awesome especially near the series end
anime,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqkzbxnpjbdg
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,its relatively new but i havent seen too much mention outside of the discussion thread s entirety of episode everything from the banter to the personalities of all those involved on its own it does a fine job at showing how different everybody involved is given the context by episode it means much more an example being s felt in this fight versus a previous timeline in which rom is killed in this timeline she lacks the courage to fight yet she threw herself into battle when rom was killed in a previous one interesting but as somebody who is a bit further ahead and knows some of what is coming the fight takes on more meaning im very much impressed on how well this first fight embodies the character of all those involved
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,pain vs naruto kappa
anime,not_removed,seconding darker than black
anime,not_removed,kara no kyoukais episode fight scene is incredible
anime,not_removed,it sickens me how good this is
anime,not_removed,had better choreography than some of the stuff from sao honestly
anime,not_removed,saw soul society arc the fighting was basically one character having op speed and a projectileweapon
anime,not_removed,i fucking love the gouf
anime,not_removed,i forgot how much i loved ms team
anime,not_removed,certainly not underappreciated to me one of my favourite fight scenes of all time
anime,not_removed,agreed seirei no moribito had some amazing fight scenes but i have to ask what do you consider less realistic and more flashy by comparison as far as armed melee combat goes anyway because what i see is a lot of backflips jumping off walls spinning breaking off speartips and so on that makes it feel a lot more like the rule of cool style of fight choreography rather than anything approaching realism then again i did longsword in hema maybe the spear guys were having all this fun when we were not around to see it and feel all jealous and inadequate
anime,not_removed,for a relatively smallunknown studio silver link is responsible for non non biyori kokoro connect baka to test rakudai kishi no chivalry just off the top of my head theyre a newer studio for sure established in the late iirc but with some experienced staff but their ability to choreograph fights impressively like those in rakudai and fatekaleid has made me really enjoy their work in particular ive really enjoyed the combat in s between gilgamesh and illya co before gil broke out of the mirror dimension they will be doing stella no mahou and brave witches in fall they did tankakun and annehappy for spring if anything their recent repertoire have earned them a reputation i very fondly remember someone linking to a clip of the flowing water from the prillya ova claiming that it was an example of ufotables godly animation only to get very proven wrong
anime,not_removed,i havent seen fatekaleid prisma illya yet because it just never looked my cup of tea but that scene really changed my opinion
anime,not_removed,whats that mecha fight from
anime,not_removed,that fight from macross plus is amazing probably why the remains one of if not my favorite valkyrie shame it gets such a poor on screen showing in pretty much every other macross
anime,not_removed,whats the big three mecha series i would always have thought macross is one of the biggest mecha franchises out there
anime,not_removed,the bazett s gilgamesh fight scene is pretty good but not quite bazett s everyone level httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoacaofjjyuq
anime,not_removed,you ever find bazettes fights you let me know too
anime,not_removed,or the one in the first episode when taiga has a kendo sword and ryuji is unarmed in his house
anime,not_removed,school rumble was brilliant
anime,not_removed,i do love the first season of gbf amazing stuff i especially love the nge reference with the fisheye shot at the end of the fight hah
anime,not_removed,freakin gbf it makes me think that every mech duel needs a flamenco ost that fight music is freakin phenomenal also what about their next fight i consider that to be much better but then again that one probably wouldnt fit into the underappreciated category
anime,not_removed,woah im not a fan of mecha but i gotta say that unicorn pv was beautiful
anime,not_removed,unicorn animation too op
anime,not_removed,the very first fight scene with the kshatriya vs the stark jegans is amazing immediately hooked me on unicorn
anime,not_removed,but imo not the best battles in gundam they look the best but they are nowhere as well choreographed as those in gbf
anime,not_removed,birdy needs way more love in general and you know a fight scene is legit when zachary snyder borrows from it for man of steel
anime,not_removed,s i really like it when she goes crazy as a kid
anime,not_removed,s fuck you whoever came up with that
anime,not_removed,the final marathon fight in the anime is way better though sure sabi had a cool fight but how about in a row with the best track in the series for the last battle cant top that
anime,not_removed,kyoukai no kanata is like they took the chuuni fights and made that reality
anime,not_removed,kyoani brings the noise when it comes to action scenes you gotta understand weight and timing really well for slapstick and those skills carry over
anime,not_removed,saw an amv with most of the from kyoukai no kanata fights its what got me to watch the show which i now love
anime,not_removed,my favourite precure fight is the all stars new stage fight against the giant bear until cure echo appears
anime,not_removed,i thought just about every fight in that show was amazing but that introduction fight was what made me think the show was going to be awesome which it was
anime,not_removed,i prefer the fight at the end with the cool color scheme that was art
anime,not_removed,that show basically monopolised all my favourite fight scenes ive seen in anime my personal favourite is raikiri vs imouto which made me the most hyped up of any fights in action series by far
anime,not_removed,ikki vs sword eater was my favorite
anime,not_removed,really like all those colors in those fights
anime,not_removed,ive always liked shinjis first skirmish it set the tone of the series on how fights are always in hightension and how it may not easily go as planned especially with
anime,not_removed,i love this fight and the music that goes with it
anime,not_removed,i thought that sequence was even better in the tv anime where you could hear ulquiorras thoughts the pacing was better too it made the blows feel much more powerful
anime,not_removed,i loved those fights they were better than a lot of the later fights imho
anime,not_removed,hmm i watched klk recently and yeah tbh i didnt really like those fights not sure what it was i guess the fact that i was sure of the outcome had a bit to do with it the character development was nice but the fights themselves were pretty bland over the top yet boring imo also i didnt like that many of the fight scenes in that anime so my opinion isnt really relevant
anime,not_removed,i will always up vote gurren lagann
anime,not_removed,lazenngan is the goddamn best good choice
anime,not_removed,but thats cg i bet you faggots actually like the way the new berserk looks
anime,not_removed,that was a fantastic fight
anime,not_removed,running at like fps the movie was many things and i personally felt like well animated was not one of them
anime,not_removed,finished that anime recently and loved everything about it have to agree
anime,not_removed,muh friendship
anime,not_removed,i am fully caught up to the series and dont actually hate it but fairy tail fights are terrible even in shounen standarts
anime,not_removed,whys she getting down votedthere are some good fights in the seriesalthough i can agree it can be boring
anime,not_removed,not the second season of darker than black lets make that very clear here folks
anime,not_removed,doubly seconding kara no kyoukai
anime,not_removed,kara no kyoukais episode fight scene is incredible ftfy
anime,not_removed,tfw has better fight choreography than sao and its from the same studio
anime,not_removed,everything with grimmjow is beautiful
anime,not_removed,yes grimmjow was super great everytime he was involved the only fight i would say i didnt enjoy was ulquiorra vs ichigo
anime,not_removed,the first episodes were great after that it went to shit right now its great chapters in
anime,not_removed,i guess at the very least moribitos choreography respects physics seems difficult to make a cool fight if you had to respect biology as well
anime,not_removed,probably just having any kind of actual fight choreography if you watch something like ultimate budget works it is mostly just lights going wooosh where as in moribito most fights look like actual fight choreography if a bit over the top
anime,not_removed,non non biyori
anime,not_removed,prisma illya is a hard recommendation to make since its a lot of injokes that that dedicated fans will only get and then loliyuri fanservice that some episodes get dedicated to which is obviously not all people are jazzed about if you can get over those shortcomings though i really do think the series is absolutely fantastic
anime,not_removed,thats from also yes you can watch it completely standalone without any prior knowledge of the franchise
anime,not_removed,gundam and macross are probably two no idea what the third one is dont think there is any other very old ongoing mecha franchise
anime,not_removed,whoops super late i forgot to specify but i meant the big three on this sub being evangelion ttgl and code geass
anime,not_removed,i agree people mention the former a lot but i always thought the latter was significantly better
anime,not_removed,i decided to make em httpsmymixtapemoevifvtbwebm httpsmymixtapemoehqwumuwebm httpsmymixtapemoemfsenzwebm httpsmymixtapemoedjbbjswebm
anime,not_removed,the curtains
anime,not_removed,i wouldnt call that a fight personally more of an attempted muggingbeating but ok
anime,not_removed,cruel af
anime,not_removed,i know a lot of people hate the way she talks but i cant get enough of it
anime,not_removed,i wish it showed the actual clash you know like a lot of fights cut out right before last blow showing just the result
anime,not_removed,that one is great s but for people without the context of the fight linking a scene with one albeit incredible strike may have been underwhelming all the fight scenes in rakudai are hype and i love it just had to choose this one because this is the first time everybody realizes what ikki is capable of
anime,not_removed,raikiri vs shizuku was really solid only black mark is that their exposition with nenesensei took a bit too long with the random boob grab
anime,not_removed,umm yeah not many things are animated in animated in is exactly fps thats right ive yet to see many fights with better you show me which fights are not fps usually its full fps only in slowmo moments or like short moments is the same
anime,not_removed,ranime will be ranime
anime,not_removed,there really isnt any context to put something like that in sao but there is also a lot of choreography
anime,not_removed,inoue x ulquiorra is always the only inoue romance i enjoyed
anime,not_removed,not sure if serious but current bleach arc sucks assim saying this as a person who even liked fullbringer arc
anime,not_removed,ss arc was supposed to be a highpoint if the highpoint had such shitty fightsnot for me downvotes for opinion stay classy weabs
anime,not_removed,ultimate budget works it is mostly just lights going wooosh youre wrong about this and i regarding some people trying to dismiss it because it looks too good or too fast or too flashy or whatever most of which should qualify for good choreography i have no problem with showering you with more gifs though if you arent convinced note that good choreography isnt just about realistic humanlevel fighting
anime,not_removed,like how dedicated do you mean ive never done any of the vn but i have wikipedia the crap out of the series also im a loli lover myself
anime,not_removed,currently watching delta so ill definitely pick it up thanks
anime,not_removed,i would have called those the big two and ive never heard of a big three at all in fact the only big three i do know of in anime is the big three endless shonens one piece naruto bleach
anime,not_removed,a gentleman and a scholar thank you sir though i realize that the scenes are too short im just going to rewatch the episodes now
anime,not_removed,ah aggravated assault the classic opener to any good love story
anime,not_removed,well she did want to kill him
anime,not_removed,dont say that youll get down voted more
anime,not_removed,cinematography sure sakuga sure fight choreography i dont think so the example used in the post was just him flipping around cutting bullets how is that good fight choreography and why was he even spinning for some of them also good fight choreography in a show with fights is always contextually appropriate what do you mean there isnt any context to put it in
anime,not_removed,probably because you used other opinions to formulate your own opinion and had a very weak basis for ruling out the show
anime,not_removed,weabs ranime your embarrassing hypocrisy is indeed classy
anime,not_removed,you cant be serious soul society had some of the best fights ive ever seen
anime,not_removed,as stated earlier none of these look anything like martial arts or realistic
anime,not_removed,should be fine if youve seen fatezero and fate staynightboth the deen version and ubw except for bazett most of the references can be understood from just the stuff the various fate anime cover
anime,not_removed,i went in having never watched any of the fate series before and i still really enjoyed it definitely worth a watch imo
anime,not_removed,i figured the big three would be something like evangelion ttgl and one other i guess because they get talked about the most on this sub
anime,not_removed,its how mine went irl but that was college and at a bar soo
anime,not_removed,great humor you got there
anime,not_removed,there are actually several examples of different fights as well as comments im saying there isnt context to do something like balancing and hanging on poles and shit id say is on par considering they fight on a barren field
anime,not_removed,other opinions what i used one opinion from other people that ss is a high point what else
anime,not_removed,being on this subreddit makes me a fan of anime now oh well im on this subreddit simply because it makes it convenient to follow when a show gets another episode also because most of the time only liveaction shows are discussed at rtelevision so no not an anime fan just a fan of tvshows some of which happened to be drawn from jap so fuck you weabs
anime,not_removed,well we wont agree bleach from what ive seen so far has extremely boring fights without any thought behind it again just a guy teleporting and having a longassreach sword and when shit hits the fan he transforms his sword into whatever ridiculous stuff
anime,not_removed,and as i stated good choreography has nothing to do with realism or martial arts so your implication that fateubw doesnt have good choreography has no basis and no it doesnt just have lights and woosh if you cared to read and think about what i postedlinked there are plenty of well choreographed fights in ubw to dismiss them as something as just lights and wooshjust flashy would be ignorant every move here is well choreographed and detailed with lots of unique moves and frames it is as you say fight choreography here is some fz httpiimgurcomepyjaojgifv one punch man has a lot of great fight choreography all of which is ridiculously over the top and unrealistic
anime,not_removed,for this sub it would be eva ttgl and code geass for actual mecha fans it is probably macross gundam and patlabor
anime,not_removed,well its a matter of opinion and its been a good while since i saw the show so i might be forgetting things but in my opinion this clip along with the others i saw usually have good animation but not good fight choreography especially compared to the fight from idolmster but maybe its just me and because i find swinging a sword into another sword with not much else being done really boring at this point i believe the point of the comparison for the two shows choreography was how creative and interesting it was comparatively not literally talking about doing this fight scene with these weapons in sao instead of idolmster even fights with swords can be as complex and interesting as a hand to hand brawl to each his own opinion though
anime,not_removed,had such shitty fights thats a second opinion
anime,not_removed,you sure got him
anime,not_removed,what are you doing discussing in the threads that arent about new episodes then hypocrisy indeed
anime,not_removed,well i wont agree ftfy both fights with renji and the fight with byakuya are what i enjoyed
anime,not_removed,i only care about realistic choreographed ubw was mentioned as an example of the opposite
anime,not_removed,ive heard good things about patlabor and i have it downloaded but i never realized it was that popular
anime,not_removed,thats my own opinion not somebody elses holy fucking shit can you even read
anime,not_removed,well wasnt my point to begin with
anime,not_removed,also because most of the time only liveaction shows are discussed at rtelevision do you really have such bad reading comprehension
anime,not_removed,fixed what i wont agree with you you wont agree with me dude got slashed cuz hes slower then somehow manages to dodge the other dudes attack becausewho the fuck knows and then guess what flashback and suddenly ichigo can make explosions end of fight there was no outsmarting no outstrategizing nothing ichigo was weaker than renji suddenly after a flashback he was stronger one swing explosion end of fight brilliant fight really
anime,not_removed,what you mean to say is that you only care about choreography depicting realistic fights of normals humans but you dismissed ubw as just lights and woosh which is just ignorant and incorrect either way that is just a narrow minded perspective and makes you unable to recognize a lot of great choreography thus also makes you unable to judge or appreciate those fights either why limit yourself maybe you should watch them frame by frame lol slower blander fights dont really take more skill or effort to execute than faster fights like in ubw quite the opposite in fact and they arent more impressive from technical or visual standpoint
anime,not_removed,well it hasnt had many releases recently but it is quite influential in the history of real robot it helps that it is pretty darn great and the mecha designs are superb
anime,not_removed,all i saw was you responding to somebody else saying that they were shit hahaha you are a joke man getting so fucking mad over anime youre literally getting pissy over a couple of comments on reddit let that sit for a while lmaooo
anime,not_removed,ive been having a lot of trouble finding an anime that hooks me lately so ill give this one a try too
anime,not_removed,you must be one of the people that only read headlines hahaha you are a joke man mad why would i be mad about an anime that i disliked if i were to be mad about everything i disliked id be mad forever actually if anything you fuckers are the ones mad because i called you weabs
anime,not_removed,id advise starting whith the early days ova it is really well made and only episodes long so it is the perfect length to try out the franchise instead of taking the on the episode main series
anime,not_removed,youre not mad about an anime you disliked its pretty clear youre mad because people dont agree with you as indicated by the downvotes youre trying to play it off but its apparent youre mad about it when youre reducing yourself to insulting others especially with the lowest hanging fruit possible have a good day mate
anime,not_removed,its pretty clear youre mad because people dont agree with you who gives a fuck whether other people agree with me on the internet d especially about tv shows if somebody agrees nice but whatever if not ok but whatever how does it affect me if somebody likes the same shows as i do ridiculous d
anime,not_removed,the big is a purely western phenomenon bleach was irrelevant to the japanese audience for many years and the manga got cancelled cause it sat at the bottom of the wsj ratings keep in mind that slot the magazine can be given to a much better series kubo began making everything up as he went along shortly after the soul society arc and drags out the story in a way that makes it impossible to adapt into anime he often gave entire chapters to showing off one ability he would have more than battles happening concurrently he tries to fill out pages with huge panels and in some cases blank or entirely black pages i suspect hell never have his own serialization in jump ever again hell be kept as one of their veteran artists and asked to draw another writers story not to mention dozens of underutilized and underdeveloped characters every possible battle shounen trope crammed in with poor execution to boot plus why would anyone need bleach when noragami exists
anime,not_removed,thats quite a biased opinion discarding criticisms using a single example the perfect counter battles happens many times per arc even more in the last one but he used as example one of the only battles that have a twist in this arc because the bad guy had a counter to this perfect counter besides that since he is talking about how is bleach seen in the west i think is relevant to say that it has more fans than one piece in many places at least when it still had an anime
anime,not_removed,naruto and op get respect
anime,not_removed,naruto and one piece get respect
anime,not_removed,i dont know if this was shared to here at any point but if it was just let me know beforehand ill remove it that being said what do you think is the reasoning behind this is
anime,not_removed,he tries to fill out pages with huge panels and in some cases blank or entirely black pages in his defense he purposely goes for a very cinematic and stylistic panel layout which would work if he wasnt making a weekly manga i want to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that it is a consistent style rather than just being lazy
anime,not_removed,where do i find wsj ratings interested in seeing the data
anime,not_removed,maybe not the anime so much but the manga for one piece definitely does
anime,not_removed,theyre probably both the most respected manga of the last two decades in japan
anime,not_removed,nevertheless bleach still my fav battle shounen
anime,not_removed,as someone who grew up watching the orignal gatchaman from the i loved crowds it had some nice little call backs and really felt like a modern day gatchaman the art style is amazing the music is phenomanal and the story is pretty great too the second season just expands more on characters and the concept of morality and stuff its good and i think it was just one of those shows that either your a fan of the old so you watched the new or you never heard of either and didnt like it or you thought it was okay but i guess it just is in a wierd spot with viewer base its sad because its fantastic when i was in japan this summer i went to a concert for the guys who do the op white ash it was great but yes more people need to enjoy the show hajimepout
anime,not_removed,i really like gatchaman crowds as you said characters are fun and aesthetic is amazing not to mention all the insightful social commentary my favorite thing from the show however was hajime shes such an awesome character
anime,not_removed,i love it hajime is one of my favorite main characters ever could give kyousougiga a shot
anime,not_removed,i really like the series it hardly gets talked about hell finding the ova between season and that contains the proper ending of season was a little tough because how the series isnt too popular i was drawn into it by the bright palette i really love the visual style of the series also really liked the themes presented in the first season of the nature of people inherently good vs bad and the common person being able to be a hero taking initiative to make the world a better place on your own rather than relying on heroes i thought it was interesting how the series moved on from those to the major theme insight being individuality and conflict vs hive mind hajime was a great character at first glance you would assume shes your typical naive genki girl but i dont think she is naive at all just optimistic and i love the optimism of this show also both the ops are my favourite is the first one but the second one is pretty good as well a few negative things though is im not a fan of the suit designs and there are a couple awkward looking didnt have budget things that i noticed in some of the animation but these are not really that glaring id say and did not take away from my enjoyment of the show at all besides the awkward ending of season id really recommend this show if youre going to watch it the ending of season one is kinda confusing so recapa bc embrace cd i would absolutely recommend watching embrace the ova before starting insight season it has a pretty big plot point that isnt really explained afterwards and is the proper conclusion to the season
anime,not_removed,one of my favorite shows but you gotta admit its not for everyone also the first episodes were pretty weak and the transformed forms looks pretty bad imo
anime,not_removed,in addition to what has already been mentioned one of my favorite things about crowds was the social commentary between highlighting the ability of trolls to take over otherwise wellmeaning systems in the first season and the second seasons concentration on the dangers of groupthink and circklejerking the crowds series has been absolutely incredible
anime,not_removed,i just finished it as well what timing anyway i liked it a lot though i can see why hajime can be a turnoff i liked the setting and i really enjoyed the social media aspect of the plot and the questions it brought up i think ruis ideas were pretty interesting for sure especially in the way he used galax to encourage people to help one another my main quibbles were ruis crossdressing and utsutsus bikini which both felt like unnecessary fanservice to me since neither were addressed or explained in any way also i wish they hadnt cut out so much from the last episode you should check out the directors cut of episode recommendation similar mech design also pokes fun at various parts of japanese society just like gatchaman pretty lighthearted and fun though keep in mind most of the series is episodic
anime,not_removed,i loved it the popolarity problem its linked that is a smart anime that need to be understood in fully to enjoy its geniality and doesnt mesh well with the typical anime viewer that see it as an action anime hajime is one of the best mc ever a walking tropedestroyer that gives the finger to every battle shonenaction tropes in the first season and then acts as the voice of wisdom in the second season and gives a new sense to be a hero hajime is a modern hero that uses her skill to link with others to improve the world but avoiding to be lost in too much sharing and both seasons are focused on a fresh and actual social problem on various questions that internet raises and on the politic apathy leading to danger for society an anime that i will rec if you seek something more deep than your usual anime without being too heavy to view
anime,not_removed,one of crowds lack of popularity is probably because frankly speaking it just looks like tumblrbait to most of the western audience and well theyre not too far off with how well tumblr ran with it secondly its probably because its a mix of for some people and that it just looks too ridiculouscampy as hell for others or both iunno though i thought crowds was a pretty good anime even if hajime is apparently perfect as hell still like her you could try checking out shimoneta its like crowds in the way that its a social commentary and absolutely bonkers but thats pretty much where the similarities stop
anime,not_removed,how do you add that gif to comments sorry know thats random love crowds
anime,not_removed,ruis crossdressing i watched crowds a while ago so i dont really remember specifics anyways i cant find anything definitive saying why rui did crossdress but the wiki says ruis crossdressing as a girl and a companion named president x are references or nods to the original berg katse from the series here is httpgatchamanwikiacomwikibergkatse i dont exactly believe this and i think rui crssdressing was just typical tatsunoko antics but rui being like berg katse is pretty cool utsutsu on the other hand was kinda weird to me
anime,not_removed,on the right hand menu here is a httpswwwredditcomranimewikicommentfaces section it explains it meguminthumbsup

anime,not_removed,ok ill let them know
anime,not_removed,he has a backstory never really felt he needed it
anime,not_removed,maybe you just wanna share this with us and that cool but sadly a doubt madhouse will come here and see this
anime,not_removed,yeah the tokyo ghoul mangaka wrote it
anime,not_removed,every great villan needs a backstory
anime,not_removed,i disagree slightly with clannad as i think the ending fits in nicely with the plot but i can see how others disagree for me its not just that s tomoya wishes everyone back to life and it undoes everything its not undoing its a continuation of the story tomoya still has those experiences and they go on forward with him i think that makes it valuable however i do agree with anohana i think s was way too short definitely squeezing too much in the last episode when they are all outside the shrine together everyone some how methodically shares their problems it was just too scripted for me and yes it was just too easy for everyone to be able to suddenly see menma but i still thought it was a nice watch i think i gave it an or on mal havent seen plastic memories
anime,not_removed,me neither notraining its raining
anime,not_removed,s death of the main girl is there hope
anime,not_removed,op im assuming you wrote the blog post same username have you seen if not watch that one and id like to know your reaction as well
anime,not_removed,put quotes around your spoiler after the s s insert spoiler
anime,not_removed,no i havent i had the ending spoiled for me and knowing it will change the viewing experience ill watch it eventually but i really wish that it hadnt been spoiled
anime,not_removed,which part was spoiled what did you find out i think there are multiple spoilers so all might not be lost
anime,not_removed,the part about the blonde girl kaori i think
anime,not_removed,might want to spoiler tag this too but if you only heard about s someones death then i think its okay i think you can still enjoy it at least of its fullness the s very foreshadowed and the anime does a good job of preparing the audience honestly you hear about ylia and you hear that its so sad you already know whats going to happen there are better reveals that make the anime imo
anime,not_removed,sorry i didnt realise the spoiler tag didnt work well ill be sure to give it the watch then and ill write about it as long as i have something unique to say about it
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,but why whats the point of non lewd body pillows you should get a bodypillow of best girl griffith from the anime berserk
anime,not_removed,httpwwwbuyfagsmoelistofshopsdakimakura also what charater should i get how is that even a question get one of youre waifu
anime,not_removed,want to get an anime body pillow i am not a pervert that aside if you want anime in your room but dont want to hug and squeeze it get a poster for your wall instead
anime,not_removed,you can buy an ironic one with gundam or something it might look suggestive but since character is clearly not a human it will be obvious to anyone but conservative nut or years old that its an ironic pillow case
anime,not_removed,its not strictly anime but its your best shot at a nonlewd body pillow
anime,not_removed,gendo
anime,not_removed,full metal alchemist brotherhood has some
anime,not_removed,everybody else is saying relevant things and im just glad im not the only one wondering this same question
anime,not_removed,live with my parent now so its not convenient to own a lewd waifuso i got my sfw clockwork planet recently from coosfly and its very softwish its not too late
anime,not_removed,animedakimakurapillowcom has a ton of designs and lots of non lewd ones
anime,not_removed,but what if i want a dakimakura out of this dakimakura
anime,not_removed,this is straight up the best pillow related thing ive seen in my lifetime
anime,not_removed,not wanting a cute tastefully dressed anime girl to snuggle
anime,not_removed,excuse me guts is best girl
anime,not_removed,donovan griffith prove me wrong s you cant
anime,not_removed,you have no idea how much i laughed at this
anime,not_removed,one of youre waifu but what if one has a waifu for each series
anime,not_removed,buyfags is that site calling us fags
anime,not_removed,with gundam or something suddenly setsuna
anime,not_removed,im suddenly inspired to buy a ramielchan bodypillow
anime,not_removed,can i buy a karling dakimakura
anime,not_removed,retweets tho
anime,not_removed,ed hold me in your strong metal arm
anime,not_removed,you might be right since s even griffith had some feelings for gatzu i apolagize for my mistake
anime,not_removed,heretic each series has a best girl but there is only one waifu otherwise you will ruin your laifu
anime,not_removed,careful there what you mean is best girl if you truly have multiple waifu then hooo boy youre in trouble
anime,not_removed,i thought you could only have one overall
anime,not_removed,welcome to ranime aka a pretending to be nice
anime,not_removed,yes fag
anime,not_removed,fag is added to pretty much anything in culture people who draw are called drawfags those who write short stories are writefags gay people are gayfags straight people are straightfags and those on a who actually buy merchandise are called buyfags
anime,not_removed,sonewithurts
anime,not_removed,why they are disgusting kaniedisgust
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,i dunno that id call that a spoiler as its kind of central to their dynamic almost from the start but better safe than sorry i guess
anime,not_removed,this is correct there are no waifu for each series what the guy means are best girls you can have best girls for each series but your waifu is holy you have one waifu and one waifu only
anime,not_removed,i have no idea how the rules work
anime,not_removed,its not possible to have a harem of waifus
anime,not_removed,its like this every series you can have a best grill and collect figuresitems of them but when people ask for your waifu you bring them towards your shrine in a separate room with almost all the merchandise of her thats the difference between waifu and best gril with every figuresmerchandise you have of any other character you need to have an additional of your waifu example you have maki and eri figures then you gotta have kotori figures
anime,not_removed,no
anime,not_removed,are we allowed to change waifus if we really want to
anime,not_removed,keep living in squalor
anime,not_removed,rl divorce is a thing so you can divorce your waifu but you have to observe the one season grieving period before moving onto a new waifu if you jump from one waifu to the next you were just a cheat looking for an out
anime,not_removed,to make luluco the best experience you really only need to see the trigger stuff kill la kill little witch academia inferno cop and sex violence with machspeed i really dont recommend this one are directly referenced kiznaiver and luluco mutually reference each other at the very end of each but its pretty impossible to notice on the luluco side
anime,not_removed,you didnt list diebuster
anime,not_removed,kiznaiver was too melodramatic for me tbh felt like a big departure from why i enjoy trigger in the first place guess inferno cop it is klk and lwa are awesome btw
anime,not_removed,sigh
anime,not_removed,ill get to it eventually gunbuster was a mess to me felt really damn rushed and messy even if the art was cool
anime,not_removed,sex violence with machspeed is very much triggeresque also it is minutes so might as well
anime,not_removed,dont listen to him sex violence with machspeed is great i even got to personally thank wakabayashi for that little piece of insanity
anime,not_removed,this does not tied to loluco but i recommend you give a go which is made by gainax it is fastpaced over the top short has a groovy sense of style to it it also shares some triggergainax talent with the people who made kill la kill can see its influence on it
anime,not_removed,s spoiler
anime,not_removed,ghost in the shell stand alone complex and ouran high school host club rewatching a random episode or two of mushishi once in a while is also pretty chill
anime,not_removed,i always rewatch gintama times and gekkan shoujo nozakikun times
anime,not_removed,for rewatches i have seen times so far maybe which is a great pick me up
anime,not_removed,fooly cooly its fooly cooly what else hellsing ultimate fell on the floor a few times when i slid out of my chair because it was to badass k project original im not even sure why i love this one its bad to most standards gintama i still havent caught up yet ive watched many episodes times
anime,not_removed,hunter x hunter ive seen the entire series more than times already
anime,not_removed,gunbuster it is short it is sweet it has kickass action it has an great ost and the ending always makes me cry im so happy i managed to snag the dvd for only £ it is usually around or quid here normally
anime,not_removed,mostly comedy and romcom anime some that come to mind are nerima daikon brothers gekkan shoujo nozakikun and nichijou
anime,not_removed,kuroko no basket and ouran high school host club
anime,not_removed,cowboy bebop i like episodic shows to randomly watch episodes of
anime,not_removed,too many new things to watch so i almost never go back to something ive already seen without having a good reason for it
anime,not_removed,uchuu senkan yamato
anime,not_removed,oreimo and rezero
anime,not_removed,sweet baby jesus
anime,not_removed,that ant arc times you are a patient person
anime,not_removed,i mostly just want to know whos idea it was to turn nyantas cat like meow into a wanna be gangster saying baby the smartest man on the planet thats who
anime,not_removed,oh god i personally loved nyantas sliky smooth pimp voice i personally hate the highschool dxd dub totally changed iseis personality
anime,not_removed,i loved dubnyanta i think it was shiroe i had to get used to karin will forever be one of the worst dubs ever made however
anime,not_removed,honestly nyanta was the only character i actually liked in the dub going from wise cat man to smooth black man
anime,not_removed,ah man im really not picky about dubs honestly im really not so i actually thought log horizon was pretty good you want a bad dub diabolik loverssweet jesus that thing made me wanna rip my own ears off just to stop the horrible horrible torture prolly didnt help that i wasnt too impressed with the story anyway and kinda felt the mc deserved to get eaten really
anime,not_removed,but dub nyanta is a kool kat i like my kats to be kool
anime,not_removed,i actually quite liked log horizons dub especially nyanta and rundelhaus most other characters were passablealright with only a couple standouts like the two mentioned it was really weird watching in english and watching in japanese took awhile to get used to but now im used to both i think my entire scale of critiquing voice acting in general is in a tumultuous state since im trying to watch garzeys wing its soooo baaaad but its sooooo goooood
anime,not_removed,log horizon was one of the few shows imo that had a great dub shiroe actually sounds like a gamer akatsuki a college student actually has an older voice and some other things i mostly just want to know whos idea it was to turn nyantas cat like meow into a wanna be gangster saying baby well imo nyantas dub sounds very much close to original nyanta and besides hes a cat whos old and acts like a gentleman what other english dub voice could you possibly give him than any other voice that he has now and i think the reason why you associate nyantas eng dub voice to a wannabe gangster is because its in english nyantas jap voice would probably sound like a wannabe gangster to the japanese too
anime,not_removed,nigga nyanta is godtier you plebius maximus
anime,not_removed,i actually didnt have to much of a problem with the log horizon dub
anime,not_removed,i liked the log horizon dub but it was one of the first anime i watched when u started up again recently
anime,not_removed,log horizon has a really nice dub nyanta especially sounds great
anime,not_removed,if you think thats bad then you should try the dub for school days its bad enough that the anime itself is bad but the dub is just adding insult to injury
anime,not_removed,dub nyanta is the greatest
anime,not_removed,you should try green greens dub next op
anime,not_removed,dont want to sound rude but get used to it the one thing that really irks me about the english dubbing industry for anime is that if you end up disliking a certain voice actor you most likely screw yourself over because there is only a very small pot to pull from for dubs especially if it is funimation
anime,not_removed,only show i like dubbed besides dragon ball is high school dxd
anime,not_removed,as far as dubs go sentai is the bottom of barrelfunimationviz and aniplex blow them out of the water
anime,not_removed,honestly his was the best voice out of the whole thing pimptastic af
anime,not_removed,like i had other problems with the dub but honestly i can overlook a lot and just enjoy the show that one character though holy shit the voice did not match the character at all
anime,not_removed,havent gotten to what happened
anime,not_removed,i honestly thought bus new va did a lot better than the first
anime,not_removed,i just couldnt handle it like i watched season in sub then switching to that dub just freaked me out
anime,not_removed,well the problem i notice most people have is that it doesnt sound authenticly japanese like i have the same experience with bojack in japanese it doesnt feel like bj because i dont generally hear japanese performances in that style i get over it i certainly dont think its bad just awkward takes getting used to as for vasi think takehito koyasu sounds a bit cartoony tomoko kaneda can be especially squealy i find japanese female cutesy voices irritating norio wakamoto reuses his one voice between cell m bison king charles etc hes likethe ron perlman of japan great actor but not much range that said i think we tend to nitpick dubs more over us cartoon acting which also often has irritating voices because its taken for granted that thats the vo whereas with subs theres a blur the senses option of subs the reason for the actual issue of a lack of diversity is down to tv demand for imports nicheness of anime firstly it has to be a bigdeal show secondly we have to be receptive to more imports get em on tvnetflix etc pokémon db are big shows but us tv dont need them that much their dubs are very lowbudget for what they are worth actually i feel that toei the dub companies do them injustice but thats a different story i find it difficult to get folks to agree i do respect your ideas attitude opinions
anime,not_removed,basically this i wish more folks would point this out like funi are intentionally cheap generally nothing special but sentai sadly cant really afford decent oftentimes
anime,not_removed,of the vas changed akeno and issei i dont know why akeno changed but isseis original va got into some child porn trouble
anime,not_removed,its hard to explain to me his voice was fine but how they changed his dialog to be more of a funny year old giving him lines that are vastly different than the sub season and did it a bit but season it seems like they decided to change his personality
anime,not_removed,oh i dont mean the actual voice his voice was fine but how they changed his lines to make him come off as more of a joking old some of the changes are just things he wouldnt say
anime,not_removed,i just kept chuckling everytime he talked i never expected him to be voiced liked that but his voice was like butter i just accepted it and reveled in its glory
anime,not_removed,well the problem probably stems from the fact that its mohafuckin jouji nakata voicing nyanta in japanese guys voice is unmistakable and unique if you associate with the character too much which is easy to do due to the characteristics changing partway is going to be incredibly hard personally i really laughed when i heard the gangster guy intonation but i can definitely understand that its not for everyone and i do prefer joujis voice over it too
anime,not_removed,but isseis original va got into some child porn trouble woah seriously i thought he just wasnt available at the time and was working on something else
anime,not_removed,like he looks at serara a child and says yeah baby just wrong
anime,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiscottfreemanvoiceactor
anime,not_removed,to be fair jail is technically something else that keeps him from being available
anime,not_removed,eh in his case i dont think baby was meant in a sexual way i have had plenty of people call me babybabe and mean it as just another darlinghoney but i can agree with you that his voice was very unexpected and i could easily see it ruining someones viewing experience
anime,not_removed,i just put in my order
anime,not_removed,site is blocked what extras come with the blueray
anime,not_removed,why the fuck is it cheaper on amazon
anime,not_removed,still to be determined so i dont know
anime,not_removed,i guess they count on attracting more customers and making up for the slightly lower price that way i just ordered from there because they ship to europe my av equipment isnt even the correct region to play this stuff but nichijou
anime,not_removed,also found nude art of her too d
anime,not_removed,oh fuck yeah for one of the best character designs in anime i want more zvezda now
anime,not_removed,welcome to the internet
anime,not_removed,this episode was both cute and sad cute because you had the female teacher whos name escapes me at the moment finally basically admit her feelings for onizuka and even fantasize about him on the other hand its sad because she also feels insecure about her looks because of some comments she overhears by students and onizuka about her breasts or lack thereof this makes her take extreme and outofcharacter measures to try and make herself more attractive its sad that the characters including the female nurse equate a womans physical attractiveness and worth to the size of their bust still rooting for the female teacher and onizuka though
anime,not_removed,here we have a fuyutsuki episode as she prepares for the okinawa trip she overhears some people talking about her body as compared to naos and how she doesnt have much boobage when onizuka is one of them she vows to show them all what shes got first she has to go swimsuit shopping there she runs into nao who helps her pick a few out back at home she tries on different swimsuits and has nao help her out when nao steps out for a while fuyutsuki gets carried away with the makeup fake tan and jewelry and ends up looking like a cast member from jersey shore thankfully nao can help her but alas she can only do so much she ends up white as a sheet and terrifies all the students dammit girl how can you recover from this humiliation
anime,not_removed,oh god onizuka shattered fuyutsukis self esteem i think they were over exaggerating a bit i mean she doesnt look like a surf board at all of course onizuka was joking around but she really took it to heart because at this point its obvious she really likes him in a romantic way at first she actually looked pretty good with the bleached hair but she was obviously inexperienced in what she did and ended up completely destroying her look she looked like a clown near the end to be honest showing up to a school like that is pretty much asking to get bullied damn it onizuka the root of the problem starts with you
anime,not_removed,man were on episode already time flies when youre laughing your ass off man dont make fun of fuyutsuki sensei small breasts are nice too haha fuyutsuki says the years old part too development fuyutsuki x onizuka otp thats a wee bit too much makeup fuyutsuki sensei
anime,not_removed,it was azusa fuyutsuki and yea it was sad seeing herself believe their degrading remarks like that i def thought she would have a little more self confidence than that but like you said shes admittingrealizing her feelings for onizuka we can only hope that ship sails
anime,not_removed,yea she really didnt look bad in the second bathing suit nao had picked for her granted shes not endowed like nao but onizuka didnt seem to care before nao was around did he
anime,not_removed,thank you im so bad with the names of everyone yeah im hoping we get to see the ship sail even a little bit before the series ends
anime,not_removed,yea theres a lot of side characters in this one def hard to remember them all as long as onizuka doesnt let the nurse nao distract him i think theres a chance lol
anime,not_removed,fatestay night
anime,not_removed,trigun its basically vashs defining character trait
anime,not_removed,masayoshi hazama from samurai flamenco the guy seriously wants to be hero and save as much people as possible
anime,not_removed,vash the stampede has a certain irony to his character with being an immaculately talented marksman yet being a wholly devoted pacifist who tries to save every one he can both the mcs are superheros commit to it by saving everyone they can even if they are criminals
anime,not_removed,steinsgate its literally the basis of the plot once the gears shift midseason
anime,not_removed,allen walker from dgrayman wants to save both his allies and their enemies in the ongoing war from the series at one point even proclaiming that the right side of his body exists to save his friendshumanity and his left side exists to save the enemies they face
anime,not_removed,monogatari series
anime,not_removed,death note no but seriously if you want a really touching and thoughtful commentary on the whole save everyone idea fatezero is perfect in that regard plus the animation is beautiful not exactly shonen and not what you are looking for but the way this show tackles that philosophy is amazing
anime,not_removed,what do you mean by selfish i thought it was usually the opposite for the shounen mc archetype
anime,not_removed,id recommend fatestay night unlimited blade works and fatezero s examines the problems with trying to be a hero and the conclusion that arises from taking it to an extreme and unlimited blade workss acknowledges those flaws but decides that its worth it regardless
anime,not_removed,touma from a certain magical index would fit this description pretty good also shirou from unlimited blade works a good portion of the show is dedicated to discussing wanting to save everyone
anime,not_removed,gatchaman crowds
anime,not_removed,well depends i wouldnt call naruto selfish for example on a whole but he doesnt want to save some people like black zetsu
anime,not_removed,higashi no eden takizawa is purely saving lives
anime,not_removed,jojo especially jonathan
anime,not_removed,its literally the basis of the plot once the gears shift midseason actually no okabe isnt so idealistic to believe that he can save everyone at least in the true ending as hes s perfectly willing to sacrifice yukitaka akihas life to save mayuris he also seriously contemplates murdering moeka
anime,not_removed,and near the end watch the movie and the person who was saved then saves the mc xd
anime,not_removed,s araragi doesnt save anyone they all save themselves
anime,not_removed,is just that goku cares about saving his friends yeah but i truly feel that he cares more about training and fighting its very common for him putting at risk everything just for watching his enemy full power
anime,not_removed,s touma pretty much discards everyone in the perfect world for selfish reasons
anime,not_removed,gatchaman crowds what is it exactly about
anime,not_removed,this comment has been removed untagged or improperly tagged spoilers are not allowed repeated violations of this rule will result in a ban have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,yeah i know but the show is about how he want to become a hokage so that anyone look at him weird i would like a show about someone that is a true altruist
anime,not_removed,none of the jojos past joseph are particularly altruistic theyll fight their way across the globe for their friends and family but generally are disinterested in anyone else jotaro is a clint eastwood aloof badass archetype who only cares about helping people because his family is in immediate danger josuke s is incredibly materialistic and takes advantage of a developmentally stunted kid that said he goes out of his way to protect okyasu when they first meet so points to him giorno wants to be a mafioso s and his only moral objection to the people he fights is that they sell drugs to kids jolyne was a petty criminal and acted primarily out of self preservation and s saving jotaros memorystand johnny was a selfish dick who s didnt care that his shots were killing innocent unrelated people josuke is too focused on mysteries to help anyone
anime,not_removed,thats what he loves to say but i dont think it is true
anime,not_removed,oh okay then i agree with the fatestay night unlimited blade works suggestions also the prequel fatezero offers a slightly different take on the subject
anime,not_removed,s well he originally tries to sacrifice himself to save them
anime,not_removed,its about being a superhero in the age of the internet and the moral questions of having heroes to protect people vs giving the people the power to protect themselves
anime,not_removed,the dangers of social networking
anime,not_removed,cool
anime,not_removed,yeah im hyped for this one
anime,not_removed,looking forward to this one too not only for the characters but also the military hardware stukas and tanks galore yum
anime,not_removed,try rmanga
anime,not_removed,okay im always missing out on the busy opening hours of the contract threads because being european has its downsides so today i thought id stay up late to post early for a change ive got a few shows on offer all shows i loved and want to share with others a sol comedy with a slower pace and some healing qualities kind of like the love child of aria and azumanga daioh episodes a sports drama with a clear story and message set in in follows a group of girls breaking out from the norm to make a baseball team together in a time girls playing baseball was unheard of episodes a comingofage story about two aspiring theater actress drama rivalry growth passion and much more episodes a character driven sol drama by pa works following a hard working strong willed positive girl moving out of tokyo to work at her grandmothers inn episodes a hilarious moe comedy excels in character dynamics and witty jokes its a bit hit or miss but if you like a good moe pure comedy this is the show episodes a more serious sol drama with believable and realistic characters and issues it has a music setting or more specifically singing episodes a weird setting but a serious executed drama two girls a young adult and a junior high student suddenly swap mindsbodies and now has to cope with their new life episodes a slow paced serious yuri romance its a soft delicate and downtoearth drama with no fancy art or crazy comedy or fanservice it has a well written cast of characters and a very steady pace episodes a sportssoldrama about a sport you probably havent heard of unless youve heard of chihayafuru called karuta its basically a memory game using cards with written poems from a famous set of historic japanese poems that might sound dull but its surprisingly energetic and hype episodes first season an episodic mysteryadventuredrama its a beautiful anime that has only one main character ginko ginkos purpose is to travel from town to town researching a phenomenon called mushi and their effects on humanity every episode features different people for ginko to help some stories are heartwarming some bittersweet and some rather depressing none those storytelling and character writing better than mushishi episodes first season alright thats what ive got on offer today i will read replies when i wake up i dont really have a number on max contracts so long as partners dont mind a few weeks time to complete them giveuponlife
anime,not_removed,ill ask again this week since there were no takers last week is anyone interested in doing a double blind with me with its a classic anime that doesnt take itself too seriously otherwise if theres a show youd like to do a doubleblind with please let me know
anime,not_removed,summons and updates all updates to existing contracts and summons of other users should be posted as replies to this comment this will help the rest of the thread remain clear for users seeking contracts multicontracters remember you can only summon users per comment make multiple comments if you have more than that many to talk to also remember im not notified of replies to this thread only pms finally a reminder that you have to use spoiler tags when necessary spoilers below technically isnt a valid substitute for the tags s spoiler text s spoiler text see the sidebar for more info kinirohug
anime,not_removed,so for im up for doing double blind contracts but if you want me to watch one of these specifically that youve already seen im fine with a regular contract where ill give you something ive already seen equal in length and obviously think you would like i will warn though im getting on drama burnout watching dramas right now so if you do pick a drama expect it to take some timeif image isnt working tell me and ill just list them edit forgot to mention natsume would be second season or longer
anime,not_removed,i will watch any episodes anime if you watch also thinking the same for the awesome shorts tv episodes duration but with this one i will have to consider the offer i recieve since its longer so sorry if i say no two episodes long anime or something like that also work for me my and a thread of saiki kusuo i made here on reddit that might motivate you to give an offer or just watching it without any contract because its an hilarious anime
anime,not_removed,im offering a contract for yozakura quartet which consists of the main series episodes and the ovas and episodes for a total of episodes it has a slightly convoluted and isnt on any legal streaming service so you will have to sail the seas to find it if you watch this you can expect to get fantastic animation with some incredible fight scenes a cool core of characters with interesting supernatural powers great world building in exchange ill watch something of similar length from my ill probably just stick to one contract right now will check back later to see which offer interests me that most edit contract closed
anime,not_removed,posting the list i had the last time i posted in one of these things with a few new additions a long list with some rather mixedreception and mostly recent shows in there i only put the first seasons of anime on here so that itd make a good stopping point ie if you like season enough go to season in exchange though id prefer to have a episode anime and also one i havent seen yet and isnt already airing
anime,not_removed,looking for someone interested in giving a shot to the amazing world of starving people underground fight club aka im looking out for a short show or ova series with some action and solid character building or some comedic sol
anime,not_removed,honestly i just wanna find something fun to watch im willing to try almost anything and i can prob reccomend u some decent animes in return
anime,not_removed,hey all im looking to a do onecour swap you pick something from my ptw list and ill pick something from yours bonus points if you want to do a double blind but id be happy to recommend you something i have already seen and really enjoyed as well
anime,not_removed,im a bit late to the party why is the thread always posted after midnight im offering possible contracts episodes a romance series animated by shaft with a neat art style has a nice twist to not make it boring episodes a series similar to a young man solves mysteries with an older woman shes in her episodes the most realistic fantasy world anime no overpowered protagonists here the fights really stand out as there is a real feel of danger ill take any series with or so episodes you can take a look at my or my list which serves as a second ptw for some ideas but as i said any series is fine
anime,not_removed,pick me something from my there are a lot of choices so im sure theres something in there for me to watch
anime,not_removed,make me watch something from my or based on my completed list
anime,not_removed,finally made it this time ok can we do a choose something from my ptw and i choose something from yours
anime,not_removed,offering up a couple of super special birthday contracts episodes a relaxing laid back show for episodes cute and funny i made a for this show last month ill take anything with around episodes doesnt need to be on my ptw list first attempt at offering up contracts lets see how this goes
anime,not_removed,anyone want to do a double blind on either gintama or legend of the galactic heroes i feel that i need to watch a longer show to start off right
anime,not_removed,im sure its not too complex but this is my first time on this business if someone would be willing to pick something out of this ptw list for me id be more than happy to return the favor great teacher onizuka psycho pass akagami no shirayukihime sengoku basara aria series ergo proxy fate series space brothers if the one who takes me up on my offer is willing to suggest me a show they really liked that i should totally watch feel free to do so thanks for having me
anime,not_removed,send me a movie or something thats cour or less from and ill send you back something of comparable length stipulation nothing from nor the garden of sinners

anime,not_removed,ive been meaning to watch some older shows so ill take you up on the slayers double blind
anime,not_removed,gekkan shoujo nozakikun i had a really fun time with this series the artanimation was great and reminded me a lot of dfrag the op was absolutely fantastic one of my favorites and the only op other than nge that i never skipped the characters were great with either mikoshiba or kashima being my favorite even the romance was pretty good s though i wish it had led somewhere but i understand its not a full adaption and other than a few flops here and there it was hilarious i really enjoyed it and ill probably be picking up the manga when i have time oh and i saw the other day and thought youd enjoy it usheroze shinsekai yori i was right to be excited for this series s it was absolutely fantastic with one of the best fictional worlds ive had the privilege to see imo its second only to the drakengardnier games figuring out how everything happened was great and somehow the early exposition episode with that library creature was one of the best in the series some of the characters were also great my favorites being maria kiroumaru and saki who had a fantastic arc through the series and i was very surprised when the time skips happened but the were handled very well another thing that surprised me were the relationships i didnt see them coming but i loved how they handled them and my god the use of the song was spectacular i only have two small problems s i really didnt connect with mamoru as a character he felt much more like a plot device than he should have and while i thought the ending was really good as is i cant help but feel like saki dieing from the death of shame after killing squealer could have been the thing to get the series to a but even with those problems it was still an amazing series i cant quite give it a but it does get a place on my favorites list ufluffyyqtasdf hunter x hunter this was definitely my favorite arc so far s i was very surprised that the troupe was the focus of an arc this early i figured wed have to wait till chimera ant but theyre really great antagonists so far pakunoda was a very interesting character and probably my favorite side character as of now but i still have episodes left so thatll probably change and i loved kurapika hes definitely become my favorite i was also shocked when they killed off all the other bodyguards they had been building them up and i liked kurapikas dynamic with them and finally the troupes attack on the second auction was by far the best moment in the series the music fit perfectly and i loved that it continued into the ed i dont really know what to expect from greed island but im looking forward to it
anime,not_removed,ummreviews akagami no shirayukihime unfortunately this series isnt bad by any means but for me it just doesnt do anything particularly interesting in the episodes ive seen to me the entire series is just based on overly stressing and just making their character personalities and blatant as possible for the two main characters shirayuki shirayuki is nice lady she has red hair she doesnt belong in the castle she wants to help people is eager to learn about medicine has a thing for zen is very forgiving zen zen is a admirable prince he also wants to help people treats all of his subjects and soliders equally has a thing for shirayuki but doesnt admit it the shipping i mean episodes in and im just saying hurry up and get it on all of the episodes ive seen are just there to make sure the viewer knows about their personality traits which are more or less obvious after youve finished watching the first episode it just becomes frustrating because it stays doing pretty much the same thing there arent really any fun interactions since most of them are between our two leads often neglecting the three other retainers who are often relegated into a very minor role in a lot of these episodes to give focus to our leads overall its a for me i dont think my rating of the series will change at all but if youre interested in watching the second season ill be more than happy to take you up on that offer so i can finish the franchise as well mikakunin de shinkoukei i only managed to watch a few episodes of the series but im really enjoying the cast especially kobeni and mashiro apart from that theres nothing much to say about the series will try to finish by next week uhadesre symphogear gx i wasnt really feeling like watching symphogear this week because of my anime burnout so ive only seen a bit im liking the new villain though and its minase inori so im excited ill definitely try to finish it by next week
anime,not_removed,gekkan shoujo nozakikun so i went into this having no expectations and i really enjoyed it i didnt realize it was made by doga kobo either which was one of the first studios that i watched when i started watching anime love lab mikakunin de shinkoukei i loved the funky op and have downloaded and listened to it many times now along with its bside track junjou karen shoten ya girl i enjoyed all the characters but most of all chiyos many expressions and mikorin best girl the comedy overall was on point every episode had moments where i was giggling like mad i saw this video before watching and didnt even realize it was from the same anime until s we get trolled by nozaki and he goes past her face to whisper into her ear chiyos laugh of disbelief was amazing and i found myself laughing along with her ending usually im mad if the main couple dont get together but that was just too perfect overall i gave it a and i recommended it to my mom who is currently watching and enjoying it as well
anime,not_removed,uluvili zetsuen no tempest first of all sorry for taking this long school can be terrible at least i didnt take over a year ok so i went in without too many expectations it helped a lot that the only thing i knew about it was that it had romance and that it was a bit shakespearean had my doubts about how that would play at the beginning i didnt like it that much either so i kept going in thinking it would be just fine and then id forget about it and then shit started coming down and it was awesome like i realised i was completely hooked when s mahiro had the talismgun and was deciding whether to listen to yoshino or samon i had just finished vol of zaregoto so the bit where they try to outreason each other was a blessing and then everything went wrong and then it turned into a teenage romantic comedy and i loved every single second of it really samon is the true hero here since he didnt go crazy after all that i kinda wanted him to end up with evangelionchan felt like he deserved it but he didnt think the same the ending was really satisfying and it tied up thematically nice after all and it felt shakespearean not only on the quotes that came up every episode thanks obama aika but it rather felt like it had some of the humor he likes to place around or the nature of the drama though at a couple of points it was really obvious it was a manga adaptation pacing issues but i felt bones did a great job here animationwise it was great got the bd version and it didnt have any glaring issues it wasnt kyoani level sakuga though sooo it was damn great and im glad i contracted this did you like arakawa if you havent watched it im in absolutely no position to complain though v
anime,not_removed,ucamilodfm uhamazuraxtakitsubo upirateofthestars im pretty sure all three of you are on aria the natural now its been around three months since ive heard from any of you guys any thoughts i know its a really sluggish show but try getting back into it
anime,not_removed,usandvikovich i dont know how busy you are with lifeother contracts but im ready to start with kimi ni todoke when you are if you want we can wait another week as well i doubt ill be able to watch much this next week anyways
anime,not_removed,ueruditious still working on excel saga will be ready by next week welp finished the contract first of all i completed humanity has declined so feel free to post your thoughts now as for what i watched space patrol luluco this is gold all the characters are just so overthetop absurd at all times which is perfect it took a bit longer than id like to really warm up but once it hit the klk parody episode everything after was perfection also the damn judgement gun morphing sfx were hilarious especially when they started throwing in alternate versions and looped it when a character rapidfired special mentions to the lwa episode you have years to live and inferno cop in hell a solid
anime,not_removed,uvalkeiser finished both season of snow white although it was a bit later than i was hoping i thought it was a really well done romance show that had a lot of good characters with good development in the beginning we see raj and he is a bit of a dick but by the end he becomes a pretty cool dude although it was a relatively serious show it still had its comedic moments which i enjoyed i also liked how the fleshed out the backgrounds on a lot of the characters in the first season we got to see how zen got to be friends with mitsuhide and how he made his first friend in the second season we got to see the backgrounds of obi shirayuki mihaya and kiki overall i enjoyed the second season a bit more than the first but they were both great i liked that after all the seriousness the last few episodes had a lighter tone to it while still having serious moments i also feel like they left off at a point where we could get a season but i havent done any research on that but i think there should be one and
anime,not_removed,ukaguraa this week i watched up to episode of shirobako im rather enjoying this show so far i dont know very much about the anime industry so this is a fun way to look into how some things go around there s i expected them to get the show done in the nick of time and they did was fun to see the old guy be that much of a help to everyone around him and see all the members of the old anime club make their appearances since you said most people enjoy cour more im exited to see how that will play out ummreviews so i finished hajime no ippo and the episode special this week i really enjoyed hajime no ippo as the series progressed the fights got better and better and the training sessions got more and more intense the running gags like aoki falling for ugly chicks and the penis jokes were pretty enjoyable i liked how they didnt try to make the other guys ippo was fighting into some big meanies that needed to be defeated they were just like ippo in that they fought long and hard to get this far which made the fights all the more intense s after finishing episode which ends with ippo knocking out sendo within seconds i almost thought it would be over right there and then which wouldve been very anti climatic but instead the fight lasted for multiple episodes and really showed the progress ippo made since he started i think he used pretty much everything he learned to beat sendo but sendo also showed off how much he had grown since his first encounter with ippo because of their history this fight was even more intense than the fight against date s it was cool to see ippo recover after his loss against date as well i felt he defeated the next opponent a bit too easy but then again ippo was pretty strong and ofcourse the training camp where he started to learn sakki was really fun with takamura knocking out a bear and no one believing it s i expected miyata to play a bigger role since he was ippos goal at the start of the show but maybe hell come back later on now that ippo is the champion in the featherweight class s i also hope that his relationship with kumi will continue to grow i enjoyed the little slice of life episode where they went to the zoo for example
anime,not_removed,ujaithe first of all apologies for not keeping you updated on my jojo progress i got quite busy during november and lazy in december i have actually finished first parts a month ago i really liked it well maybe part not as much but the one was a blast to watch fights were awesome the story was very interesting and characters were diverse id say my favorites were joseph and von stroheim joseph because i loved his laid back attitude during fights and how he slowly irritated his opponents von stroheim because he was straight up awesome
anime,not_removed,uknirky aoi hana completed just finished off the series and i enjoyed it quite a bit the characters were all very believable in their roles and the shows managed to create a really nice and peaceful atmosphere that was able to lull me into the their world quite nicely i particularly liked sugimoto from the main cast as she has a lot of traits i love in characters like being a strong person individuality and having their own personal flaws that they must work to fix s which she does and i love it i wasnt a huge fan of achan she didnt fit in with the calming atmosphere of the show to me as she had so much energy and the way she spoke and interacted with everyone else just felt off from the rest of the cast i dont think shes a bad character by any means i just didnt think she fit as well as she could have but i do appreciate her ability to cheer those around her up fumi i wasnt a huge fan of at the beginning but she really grew on me by the end i said before that im a fan of strong women like sugimoto but on the other side of the coin i dislike women who seem to be rather weak willed and fumi came off to me this way at the beginning luckily i was wrong about her and she turned out to be a great character by the end i particularly liked s when fumi told sugimoto to grow up in the second to last episode and sugimoto apologizes to her it really showed that she can stand up to people when pushed she just generally doesnt want to and i appreciated that for the romantic element of the show i mostly enjoyed it and am very glad it didnt slip into melodrama much i did find the scene where s fumi and ikumi started crying in the cafe just after sugimoto broke up with fumi to be a bit much but as far as romance series go thats pretty good the actual romance progressed nicely and there was enough drama within them to keep my interest s while im sad none of them worked out im happy with the direction they went i gave it a
anime,not_removed,ubeartuzzi gosick it took me longer than i expected but i finally managed to complete gosick the setting in a interwar europe filled with intrigue is perfect for this show the buildup during every case was greatly handled with every detail being necessary to solve each mystery and all contributing to the main story in some cases the relation and implications with other mysteries is very direct like the death of the fortune teller and queen berrys voyage cases towards the second half of the mystery everything started to make sense from the predictions of the fortune teller to the leviathan story and the coco rose murder all these pieces together unveiled a bigger plot of military and political intrigue that led to an unavoidable world war as an historical anime the politics and the way of thinking of characters like marquis albert are actually accurate if youre interested in how the events and characters in the last episodes are a reflection of the history europe lived in that time i found this interesting final thoughts the serious and sometimes dark atmosphere of the show really helped the buildup of every mystery but it was sometimes ruined by the forced comedy i didnt find kujo as a suitable companion for victorique i wouldve preferred a more serious and mature character favorite character victorique de blois im not a fan of tsunderes specially violent ones taiga was my only exception but she had a great development with a interesting background her character design and outfits were beautiful and in general shes an intriguing character i enjoyed discovering the different facets of her personality favorite case undying alchemist leviathan this arc was great from beginning to end a murder a story of a man that produced gold and a book with a mystery waiting to be solved i really wasnt expecting the solution to this mystery and how everything was linked to the alchemist story its also a mystery of great importance because it foreshadowed what was coming revealed important background of the main story and has great relevance in the coco rose mystery final score this was a hard show to rate lots of mixed feelings started as a solid whit its good mystery of the week format then even though the mysteries got better characters as cecile and kujo ruined the serious atmosphere and that made me lower the score to in the second half things got better with the excellent leviathan and coco rose arcs which boosted my score back to after all the events of the last episodes and that beautiful prologue with a happy ending i decided to give the show a
anime,not_removed,sooo udoctorwhoops how is sound of the sky going
anime,not_removed,umsbobdobalina i have finished fatestay night i would say it is an okay introduction to a whole large franchise that i have a feeling is going to be pretty fun for now it is a from me because of how obvious it is that they have adapted stuff from different routes some knowledge from the wikis but it was painful how it was skewed over to one girl but yet that girl lost because i couldnt stand my favourite character in the anime actually losing i went on to finish fateubw movie and got even more frustrated with the movie anyway the artwork is great for both fate and ubw so it is pretty good a passing thought on this is how similar it is to the shakugan no shana franchise with a lot of elements being similar perhaps because of a similar target audience they have a similar story to appeal to the same group of people fateubw tv series is on my watching list for now since i do plan to finish this asap it looks a lot more promising than the one i have watched i admit to bias for tohsaka rin because of how awesome and cool she is
anime,not_removed,this is a little awkward but i was on a trip to america and forgot my anime hard drive back at home so i didnt get a chance to watch the shows i was meant to finish by now ill get back to you probably tomorrow on my thoughts on both shows even though i shouldve finished both a couple weeks ago wallbang on a sidenote i was able to make some progress on bakemonogatari and id love to hear your thoughts on nichibros if you finished
anime,not_removed,ucaptainbds chihayafurushock sorry it took so long took a while to get through the beginning of this season beginning i didnt like that much and started making question a bit why did i like season so much i started wondering if i should drop my season score or keep it the episode games were really uninteresting and just having karuta game one after the other pretty much knowing theyll win was hard to get through along with not liking the freshman characters that much but i think as soon as it got to aratathe queen and the semifinal where the matches were multiple episodes thats where it improved and reminded me why i loved it and desire a season badly the half episodes were tense as hell just waiting to see what will happened next i groaned whenever an episode ended because it was a cliffhanger and i needed to watch more and it became a much better binge the second half saved it the characters came back to why i loved them and even though i dont think its as strong as the first season it still really wants me to see how it continues with a hopeful season overall
anime,not_removed,unextgenalchemist just got done with spirited away and thought it was pretty good it wasnt the best anime film ive seen but overall i thought it was good it is certainly something i would recommend to just about anyone and a film im happy to have seen
anime,not_removed,ullllnd i finally finished only yesterday i thought it was a pretty good movie overall i definitely enjoyed the parts when she was young more since they felt a bit more relatable ultimately i did think she was a bit of an uninteresting character there wasnt anything really unique or memorable about her i can hardly remember her name i liked how the movie ended as it brought both the young and old parts together it was pretty satisfying unrelated but i really like the art in ghibli films though the characters do look a bit weird when theyre laughing the characters really liked to laugh in the movie especially the main guy
anime,not_removed,utobimta i just finished flag it took quite a while for a one cour show but i got there in the end honestly i didnt enjoy it all that much the setting of following a war from a photographers persoective and only through the visuals of her camera really piqued my interesting and it was interesting and somewhat facinating at first but i grow tired of it after a few episodes when it wasnt new and fancy it sometimes felt like it was kind of in the way like it made my mind and attention wander as i looked around and thought about all the numbers and info and stuff on the display i hope there werent actual relevant information and easter eggs in those numbers and the layout though cause i didnt look at them or notice them that way the robot never interested me rather the opposit but i knew that would happen i dont have interest in mecha even less robots even less in military setting but i thought id try this show anyway as it looked like they wouldnt matter much they did kind of matter and was kind of the focus so that led me to lose interest in a lot of the important plot scenes and episodes which ultimately made the larger part of the series a tad bit boring for me personally s the deathflag from the start and throughout for shirasu was a bit too strong though maybe intentionally but then they shouldnt make such effort in the episode to make it look like she escaped her inevitable plotted fate just to kill her off again halfway through the last episode what i liked about the show was the writing of most of the characters and the focus on them in this setting how it affected them and so on i also like the soundtrack not amazing but solid and fitting and the op was great i loved that i liked the final two episodes it was a good ending to the show and even though there were robot action my attention and focus was still strong through the final episodes which was good because until then it didnt grab my attention the middle part didnt give me much at all overall its far from my favorite show but it was a different show and even though i didnt really like it all that much im glad i watched it oh and i almost forgot pou looking just like rikyu was such a weird coincidence as the other part of this contract was hyouge mono
anime,not_removed,i really want to offer you sakura any interest in starting something a bit longer you could give me an assortment of anime in exchange to make length roughly equal
anime,not_removed,id be up for natsume been meaning to watch it forever
anime,not_removed,ill take you up on lotgh been meaning to watch it for awhile perhaps it isnt a true double blind since ive seen the standalone prequel but its close enough itll be nice to have someone to watch it with since it seems like a lot of people cream their pants over the series
anime,not_removed,are you still open for your double blind contracts if so ill take macross sdf since ive been meaning to finish it for a long time ill watch again from the beginning if thats fine with you you can go ahead and submit the contract
anime,not_removed,id watch saiki in return for andor or just either of those in return for kiniro mosaic season though
anime,not_removed,i already started kiniro mosaic on my own who needs a contract for that show so i cant really form a contract with you but how would it be if you watch and in return the first one has two minute episodes so that it worth one episode in fact the second one has eight minute episodes so also worth one episode vas are great the first has hanazawa the second one a bunch of famous vas some are also part in kiniro mosaic the reason i want you to watch it i want the opinion from someone else they are lesser known so edit if you find someone else who want to watch kirino mosaic you can take him i also want to spread the love of karen to the whole world edit you already watched the whole teekyuu so you can ignore that part
anime,not_removed,any interest in the movies im not sure of the actual length i think its around in total run time
anime,not_removed,ill take mob psycho for kon
anime,not_removed,ill take sore ga seiyuu and mob psycho for gin no saji and inoubattle no rush if you choose to take it
anime,not_removed,alright its a bit weird to do it like this but id like to offer seasons of and for bento teekyuu is a super fast minute short about the school tennis club that never plays tennis it does kinda count as sol it has super fast dialogue and its super hype i dont know any other way to describe it other than its teekyuu its the sort of show that will leave you staring at your screen thinking what space patrol luluco is triggers most recent minute short it references heaps of gainax and trigger shows kill la kill ttgl evangelion little witch academia and seeing as youve seen those shows i really think this something you will enjoy the characters are super memorable and super endearing its another show where id just say watch it all up seasons of teekyuu mins and episodes of space patrol luluco mins comes to a total of mins episodes of bento comes up to mins this is unconventional so feel free to say no but i really think these are two great shows
anime,not_removed,how about and im up for anything but heres my if it helps
anime,not_removed,how about after looking at your mal i think youd really like it heres my im up for anything
anime,not_removed,hey ive checked out your ptw and not having watched dusk maiden of amnesia is a crime in my book ill happily watch ef tale of memories its on my ptw and its a romance made by shaft so im down edit as for the time bracket its up to you to decide im a pretty fast watcher and so i can watch about full episode season in two days without a problem
anime,not_removed,ill watch grimgar for non non biyori
anime,not_removed,watch code geass man pick any similar length anime for me
anime,not_removed,ill give you some choices if you give me some choices cowboy bebop bakemono no ko black lagoon hellsing ultimate princess mononoke all i ask is that you pick something similar in length that i havent seen before my mal should be in my flair
anime,not_removed,how about amagi brilliant park and you can choose from mine preferably similar length
anime,not_removed,you gave saki a so youll also probably love my mal preferably pick something from medium or high priority
anime,not_removed,ill take acchi kocchi and i offer you in return
anime,not_removed,ill take acchi kocchi for but kamichu has specials which should be watched as theyre relevant to the plot i see acchi kocchi has a episode ova we can throw in but there would still be more episodes on you is it still okay you can throw in whatever episode worth show you want or find another solution if you want or i could try finding a different show for you what do you say
anime,not_removed,ill take you on with this ive been meaning to watch and itll be easier to do with someone else im sure
anime,not_removed,i can recommend both psycho pass and the fate series if you want to get the best extremely subjective opinion here start to fate i would recommend the original deen anime if you dont want to read the vn which would probably take hours unless youre an incredibly fast reader even if it isnt the best anime of the series but ufotables ubw and zero are also acceptable starting points if you want to select any show or series of comparable length off of my list for me to watch my ptw list is
anime,not_removed,how about ill basically take anything of the same length cour you can try to choose something from my but since its just some mutated monster feel free to take anything that you liked doesnt have to be on my ptw although chances are it is anyways lol
anime,not_removed,im down for that but i wont be able to start till late january early february if youre cool with that you can submit the contract
anime,not_removed,ill offer up going off waht youve rated you should enjoy it for the seasons of gochuumon
anime,not_removed,you should watch haibane renmei my ptw is literally never up to date i have one thing there kek so just suggest something and i do not sail the seven seas
anime,not_removed,is fantastic in my top
anime,not_removed,hah if so then yes staying up was a lot harder than i thought itd be
anime,not_removed,sounds good ill take akatsuki no yona ill submit the contract have fun
anime,not_removed,im up for two contract ill take bakuman for mushishi not sure about twgok though as i really dont enjoy harems all that much do you have another one cour if not ill take twgok
anime,not_removed,great ill take honey and clover had it on my radar for too long ill add the contract have fun
anime,not_removed,sounds great i will go ahead and submit the contract hope you enjoy
anime,not_removed,shinsekai yori hello im not your contractor but shinsekai yori is my absolute favorite anime and always love to talk about it the great world building along with the dark history that led to this dystopian future gives sense to all those morally wrong rules they have one of the major criticism of the show is that the main cast the kids are plain or act in an unconventional way but in my opinion they do act according to the society they grew up which is very different from ours as for your spoiler s saki didnt die from death feedback because even when knowing that the queerats were once humans she doesnt consider them equals in her perspective the cantus users are the evolution of humans and queerats are just traces from a previous life form thats why she as the chairman of the ethics committee can take such cold decisions like their extermination
anime,not_removed,im unrelated here but just wanted to say s only body guards died the kissing girl and the dog dude the other ones are still alive
anime,not_removed,woah youve done some serious watching over the past week and all shows were really fun watches as for shinsekai yori i was expecting complaints on most if not all of the characters because thats the main criticism most people have for the series so i was surprised to see you liked this aspect someone already explained the saki thing but i can see where youre coming from with what you wanted to happen regardless really glad to see you liked the show overall and im happy you werent turned away from the nature of the relationships shown as thats another major reason people stop watching the show did an amazing job explaining everything about its world bit by bit as for penguindrum i havent started it yet as im currently making my way through another contract but ill make sure to keep you updated on my progress
anime,not_removed,glad to see you loved the yorknew arc i also really liked that arc and it only gets better from here on out and yeah the music for the show is really good the opening and gons theme are probably some of my favorites but the piece they used as you described is also hella good as far as my part of the contract goes ive watched the first episodes of assassination classroom i really liked it so far the show grabbed my attention within the first seconds with the intro of the teacher and s when they all grabbed their guns and tried to shoot him the opening is also pretty cool though either im watching a bad quality version or the cg isnt that well done the humor is also good so far so if it continues on this trend im gonna enjoy both seasons i also finished your lie in april i liked it but i dont think i liked it as much as other people i thought the ending was really well done s kaoris death was expected but how they did it with kousei imagining her being there as he played the last piece so they still had their last play together was really touching and although its an end good all good kinda ending i still feel that watari got the shorter end of the stick
anime,not_removed,sorry for the late reply been pretty busy recently im glad you enjoyed the op so much its definitely up there as one of my favourites its hard to pick a favourite character from that cast theyre all pretty good glad you enjoyed it enough to consider checking out the manga dfrag i wish i had more time to watch this show because so far its been great i havent watched a show so focused on comedy in a while so its been a nice change of pace ive been enjoying the characters with kazama being a great straight man ill try to finish it this week so i can let you know what i thought of the series as a whole but for now im loving it
anime,not_removed,no problem at all i can follow your progress on mal and i thought so in my opinion symphogear is really only watchable with the right mindset being negative or unmotivated will only cause that you are overcritical and that is the wrong way watching it have fun
anime,not_removed,i watched the first episodes of mikakunin so far not sure how to feel right now because im a very rare case when i kinda like the characters but i dont really find it funny usually both go together for me anyways its just the start so hopefully i like it more later on anyways dont feel pressured to finish it asap i take my time with the contracts
anime,not_removed,uknirky glasslip ive also managed to finish glasslip i mean nothing really happened in the episodes and im just waiting to see something interesting if you were to ask me what happened in the series my reaction would be ¯ツ¯ the series didnt even take time to explain its gimmick nor was the gimmick even necessary for the show why couldnt have just been a normal glassblowing anime focusing on sol stuff instead of the useless drama im surprised people actually favourite okikura overall the series needed more focus and resolution for everything that happened and scrap out whatever the seeing the future gimmick was all about its not the worst thing ive seen which is quite amazing nor was i too bored by it honey and clover gets the lowest rating for me a ukaguraa hachimitsu to clover i finished it last week and given how you know my feelings on the series youll find it to be no surprise that i actually forgot everything that happened i do remember the last few episodes still not doing anything for me overall it is the most boring anime that i have ever seen in my entire anime watching career while i recognise that the show is definitely not my taste the rating ive given it is just on how much i enjoy an anime so in this case a gift of for the series even glasslip was more interesting and that gets a pretty bad rap around here
anime,not_removed,well rip i loved shirayuki zen the sides despite not much screen time dedicated to them and the main relationship the show is almost entirely character focused so i can understand not liking the show quite a bit if you dont enjoy them though i disagree with your point that shirayuki doesnt belong in the castle though s i found one of the points of shirayukis development to be proving she does belong there even when some doubt that she does i think the only that dont view her as being worthy of being there are the commander in episode or and zens older brother i guess what i found compelling about them is that they are a breath of fresh air in a genre that i feel is horribly stale shirayuki is shown on multiple occasions to be very strong determined and independent which is rare in the shoujo genre she was completely capable of choosing her own destiny and was able to achieve her goals all on her own for zen he was a strong somewhat badass character who wasnt shown to be needy of shirayukis love and he was able to achieve things all on his own and make a lot of important things by himself these things are also rare in the genre i found their relationship to be the strong point of the series but i can understand why you were annoyed with how slow it moved tbh though it had one of the fastest moving relationships ive seen in a shoujo outside of nana which is technically a shoujo but imo its josei so it didnt bother me at all i liked that it was a mutual relationship that they both benefited from but were never shown to be dependent on one another they were just two independent people who happened to be in a relationship and i loved that aspect of it i cant really defend the side characters well as they didnt have much screen time like you said but i found them fun obi was interesting and a complete bro to both zen and shirayuki the others had some funny interactions and i felt there was a good sense of how well they knew each other and the way they could play off each other was fun i enjoyed the snide comments and the pep talks they gave each other now while i did enjoy the show quite a bit i think its far from perfect a lot of the dialogue felt off at certain points in the series lots of things being said that were already known or just interactions that felt off because most people dont talk the way they did another issue i had was that the episodic plots varied in quality a lot while they all served to make the characters better imo a lot of them just didnt have that interesting of a narrative worldbuilding something i usually love in medieval settings wasnt super impressive but that might be because i was expecting fantasy elements and never got any it seems like an interesting world but were mostly only shown the castle and are only sometimes shown things outside it it could be better connected is all im saying though i think it is decent overall the last thing that bothered me was how hard they pushed the choose your own path in life thing they did not have to state it that many god damn times haha overall i gave it a i do plan on watching season but since i watched the bluray version of season season blurays arent out and i refuse to downgrade in quality ill have to pass on watching season with you for now hope thats understandable
anime,not_removed,this is super late since ive been busy lately but im glad you and your mom enjoy it i loved that the show was comedy first and romance second and the jokes rarely fell flat for me im glad you see the light that is best girl mikorin haha kon unfortunately i havent had a whole lot of time to watch anything but i did manage to get this far and ill try to finish up this week its been enjoyable so far it feels like the characters have good chemistry which is nice while im not the biggest fan of moe slice of life its still done a good job of keeping me interested so its not like its a chore to get through or anything so yeah looking forward to keep watching it
anime,not_removed,i started it yesterday and it was there when i realised i missed watching aria daily now that i have time i should be able to advance on it
anime,not_removed,i really hate to say this but this contract really isnt working out for me you are correct i am on aria the natural right now but i cant bring myself to start it i dont want to go around dissing aria because i can easily understand why some people love it but the truth for me is that it bored me to tears slow paced shows arnt my thing and neither is moe i love the technical aspects of it the worldbuilding the music but a slow show with an uninteresting plot i pretty much had to force myself to watch the first season and really do not want to watch another episodes of it i will try to watch a couple more episodes of it today but in all honesty i probably wont i havent been all that intrested in anime latley im sorry its staying on my watch list for a rainy day but the likleyhood of me continuing with this contract anytime soon is pretty low again i am really sorry about this i hate just jumping out on a contract
anime,not_removed,im glad to see you enjoyed it i thought favaro was pretty great as well but did you watch dub or sub because i heard dub favaro is pretty great too im not too sure if hell be in the second season but heres hoping
anime,not_removed,greetings and long time no seen hows it been will be busy this week with some other contracts but we can start with the second season of kimi ni todoke slowly as a warm up
anime,not_removed,ok after some thought i cant remember what i was going to say at all but i definitely enjoyed the series overall with watashi being one of my new favorite characters my only problems were s that i think that the time repeat arc could have just been one episode and i dont really think there was a good reason to tell the whole story in nonchronological order i think it would have been just as good if not better in chronological order except for the last two episode which were just formatted as flashbacks anyways im glad you enjoyed luluco it was my aoty and you can see why i had you watch lwa and savwm before this
anime,not_removed,hello im glad you liked them a lot im a fan of romances and this one had this heartwarming disney princess vibe i agree with you that the first one was just about the sweet interactions between akagami and zen while the second one was more focused on character development gosick i finally have some free time so i plan on binge the show this weekend so far im liking the whole sherlock meets grim brothers vibe in a post wwi europe victorique is an interesting character and shes the main reason im liking the show i love the she makes before solving a mystery and she looks so cute in her my only objection is her tsundere attitude but ill wait to see how she develops in the remaining episodes as for kujo i dont like him at all always yelling and overreacting i hope he gets some major development because victorique is great sorry im taking too long but now that i finally started watching it i can assure you ill finish it in no time
anime,not_removed,glad you enjoyed hajime no ippo pretty much agree with everything you said on it especially the point where you say the opponents arent some meanies that need to be put down spoiler yea that was one thing that always kind of bothered me in the show s i really wish there was more of a conclusion to their rivalry hope you enjoy challenger and rising just as much
anime,not_removed,thats fine ive got a few contracts ive recently finished but ive been to busylazy to update yeah joseph and stroheim were great didnt like part all that much either but part sold me on the series as for initial d im eps into second stage and im liking where it seems to be heading the art change put me off at first but i think i prefer it to the first season at this point ill probably continue watching it sometime tomorrow
anime,not_removed,im glad you liked it thanks for the writeup i share many of your views but ultimately i loved it a lot more than you in the end all your mentioned problems or irks are things i find common in most aoi hana related discussion and while i liked most of them and wasnt bothered by the others myself i ackowledge them all i like achan a lot for example to me she fitted into the show quite alright and made me enjoy it more her energy attitude and kindness is a nice contrast to a lot of the other characters but thats my preference if you enjoyed it enough to be interested in the continuation i strongly reccomend the manga btw sadly sugimoto has lesser of a role in the rest of the story and achan a bigger role so youll see what you do its well written so i reccomend it regardless
anime,not_removed,i agree with pretty much all you have here the cast was basically carried by victorique and most of the side characters had more of an impact than kujo grevil roscoe cordelia and albert offered more than kujo for some reason i was able to look past kujo and gosick became one of my favorites the mysteries started off a bit weak and were only there for i think world building purposes that would last a couple of episodes then move on but the final arc lasted for essentially the entire second half which i liked glad you liked it hopefully we can do another contract again
anime,not_removed,i finally finished it it took me a while because ive been really busy with stuff but i finally got around to it id definitely say that i liked it thats for sure but i cant say i love it as much as a lot of people on ranime seem to do i didnt have any major problems with the series but there also wasnt anything that i really think is fantastic the characters were charming but they didnt feel very fleshed out the plot near the end felt a bit sudden and unnecessary for me and the show seemed a bit convenient at times but other than that i quite liked it kanata is adorable and the setting is great and the stories were enjoyable overall while i didnt much care for the final arc or rios backstory i still think the show was very enjoyable id give it a its fun its charming it doesnt have any major problems with it and overall was enjoyable to watch but nothing amazing
anime,not_removed,im so sorry i havent been able to reply until now my mobile app didnt say i had a message ever and this is the first time ive been at my computer since then once again my apologies im glad you enjoyed the fate series oddly enough saber was best girl for me i also really liked rider in the series as well its been awhile since ive seen it but those are the two that really stood out did you watch fatezero as well ive never heard of shakugan no shana ill have to check that out i am almost done with love chunibyo and other delusions work has been kicking my ass if school hasnt so far its pretty good though very cringe worthy at timesa lot of times beyond the boundary was pretty good but it was defiantly not what i was expecting which is a good thing i was expecting this epic romance toradora style but it ended up being more like noragmi in a sense once again im sorry this took so long to reply to and ill let you know when i have finished love etc
anime,not_removed,well let me know how things are going whenever progress reports are just as interesting on my side im behind on nichibros as well between catching up with the fall season and watching sakamichi no apollon not even for a contract imsorryitwastoogood
anime,not_removed,better late than never glad you enjoyed it i also didnt care so much for the freshmen although they partially redeemed themselves by the end im debating whether to read the manga or hold out for a season
anime,not_removed,yessss another chihayafanatic
anime,not_removed,the manga has chapters worth of continuing if you read i had to give in to it as season doesnt seem to ever be happening
anime,not_removed,hey dropping by to say that youre missing out by not reading the manga i think the anime ended around since its chihayafuru at its absolute best harada sensei is the most badass old dude ever
anime,not_removed,glad you liked it out of curiosity what would you say your favorite anime film would be
anime,not_removed,i can totally understand that you would be bored by flag if you didnt care about mechas im not a big mecha fan aswell but i really dig some good hard science fiction plus the combat and characters in flag were refreshing in contrast to the usual teenaged mecha mc who defeats dozens of troops despite not having any experience
anime,not_removed,interested but youre taste isodd and hard to pick ones id think you like ones i thought youd like turns out you didnt or vice versa and im afraid of picking more you wouldnt like similar to last time if youre willing to try again with me ill offer some in equal amount of episodes
anime,not_removed,damnit forgot to mention it would be second season unless if youre fine with doing season while i do season that sounds weird
anime,not_removed,someone has me going on sakura and id rather not do two longer series thanks for the offer though
anime,not_removed,im in enjoyed delta quite a bit and about time to see where it all started
anime,not_removed,i will take the saiki contract if youre fine with it i was planning to watch humanity has declined even if im not sure if it will be my type of comedy and kekkai sensen since its getting a sequel soon so this contract couldnt be better if you say yes i will send the contract
anime,not_removed,if youre fine with me watching only girlfriendnote since i already watched teekyuu sure just tell me if youre ok with it and i send the contract about my opinion on teekyuu well digibro said something like this today in a video after watching season and i totally agree with him teekyuu is special i dont have time to read the subtitles i dont get half of the jokes but its a very short watch and i simply have to appreciate that this anime exists i dont really like it because i dont get half of what happens for me to laugh but its there and i will watch it anyways
anime,not_removed,an excuse to experience more of the nasuverse with a series thats been pretty high on my personal priority list ever since starting and enjoying the heck out of fatestay night a protagonist that ive seen in multiple best girl lists and whom looks like a complete badass sick ass animation from the few highlights ive seen posted occasionally meh s the movies is episodes worth which is pretty much perfect id be more than happy to accept the contract will submit if you want to go ahead with it
anime,not_removed,sure itll take a day or two before i start kon got to finish sequels to certain shows i watched this year but i hope to finish it before january when my winter break ends
anime,not_removed,sure i guess im in a bit of a tough spot in terms of things to watch so having enough but not too much is good for me
anime,not_removed,ive actually been procrastinating about watching luluco for a while so why not ill submit it
anime,not_removed,i can do gunbuster u can choose between your lie in april and grimgar whichever one ur feeling
anime,not_removed,ptw sure ill take you up on it how does amagi brilliant park sound to you
anime,not_removed,that ones been sitting on there for over a year it was about the time to get into watching it im in ill probably have it watched for the next weeks thread ive submitted the contract form
anime,not_removed,ok sounds good how does sound to you if it sounds good then you wanna go ahead and submit the contract
anime,not_removed,do you have a mal page where i can pick from
anime,not_removed,ill pick bakemono no ko black lagoon and princess mononoke here are your choices psycho pass kokoro ga sakebitagatterunda prison school no game no life shinsekai yori btw i havent done an anime contract before
anime,not_removed,ef a tale of memories good
anime,not_removed,wow we have a lot of the same taste your list is also so organized how about we go in double blind for one of the options below sailor moon super s tamako market saikin imouto no yousu ga chotto okashiinda ga
anime,not_removed,sure do you want to submit the contract or should i
anime,not_removed,three extra episodes is fine i dont mind watching them and im not sure id be able to come up with anything worth three episodes anyways do you want to submit the contract or should i
anime,not_removed,which one though i posted two
anime,not_removed,how pertinent to the first season is the second
anime,not_removed,sure thing take your time
anime,not_removed,sure im not certain i can do episodes in a week though
anime,not_removed,ok then here is one of my favourites that has similar length kokoro connect i hope you enjoy it btw can you do the contract thing cause i dontt know how
anime,not_removed,alright ill take it
anime,not_removed,alright personally twgok is one of my favourite harems because its a little different from battle harems that you see a lot but thats fine maybe
anime,not_removed,s i cam understand why some would have that complaint but other than mamoru i really liked the main cast and i understand why she didnt die and i think the ending was really good its just a small change that i think could have been just a little but better
anime,not_removed,s oh thats right i thought mustache guy died i was just thinking that melody kissing girl dog dude and mustache guy were all being built up to be a group of recurring characters so i was surprised when some of them were killed off
anime,not_removed,yeah i was actually very exited to watch this series i watched episodes in one day i can see why people would have those complaints but i think those aspects all just come together to compliment the world around them and ive found im just really picky about endings and this one was by no means bad it was actually pretty good i just think it could have been just a little bit better and take your time with penguindrum theres no rush
anime,not_removed,id say my favorites either gon or hisokas theme yeah the cg isnt that great it just doesnt really work with the art style but i hope you enjoy the series s i agree it kinda feels like they forgot he exists in the second half
anime,not_removed,oh i had almost forgotten we had a glasslip contract hell i had almost forgotten i watched glasslip myself not the most memorable shows out there and definitely not the best written one it looks rather nice though and as it was for you i wasnt bored by it so who cares ¯ツ¯
anime,not_removed,disappointed to hear that the show doesnt improve at all
anime,not_removed,i disagree with your point that shirayuki doesnt belong in the castle though in my short review i think this point wasnt express out well due to the brevity of it its not like i thought shirayuki didnt belong in the castle but in that thats what the show was trying to show us because she was an outsider i felt that she did fit in but the show went out of its way a lot to show it like s izana and how she is just pretty much connected to zen and no one else i guess what i found compelling about them is that they are a breath of fresh air in a genre that i feel is horribly stale shirayuki is shown on multiple occasions to be very strong determined and independent which is rare in the shoujo genre i dont disagree with this point shirayuki was a strong woman who didnt need no man s except when she was about to shown off like a prized possession in episodes or but after one or two episodes we pretty much know who she is and the kind of person she is as far as ive gotten there havent really been any strong moments apart from episode where this gets challenged zen he was a strong somewhat badass character who wasnt shown to be needy of shirayukis love and he was able to achieve things all on his own and make a lot of important things by himself these things are also rare in the genre i did like how they werent dependent on one another like every other shoujo love anime but like ive said with shirayuki i felt that all is said and done about their characters after a few episodes nothing will ever likely change apart from the fact the fact their relationship will develop further obi was interesting and a complete bro to both zen and shirayuki the others had some funny interactions and i felt there was a good sense of how well they knew each other and the way they could play off each other was fun i enjoyed the snide comments and the pep talks they gave each other i actually loved the interactions with all the side characters because i felt that it was the only thing that was fresh outside the episodic episodes which just focused on say this is who shirayuki is a nice and helpful person while they all served to make the characters better imo a lot of them just didnt have that interesting of a narrative worldbuilding something i usually love in medieval settings wasnt super impressive but that might be because i was expecting fantasy elements and never got any it seems like an interesting world but were mostly only shown the castle and are only sometimes shown things outside it yeah unlike similar sorts of medieval type of shows it just doesnt really explore what makes the setting so novel we get neighboring politics here and there with occasional travels which is pretty much the scope of what the creator sets out to show the world in the end they are ancillary in eyes of the creator since its just pretty much a show thats just based around our two leads i find this disappointing since in most shows the side characters really help to bring out fun and great character moments since its not just relegated to two characters who barely throw shade at each other the last thing that bothered me was how hard they pushed the choose your own path in life thing they did not have to state it that many god damn times haha this was pretty much the crux of every shirayukicentred episode hahaha i do plan on watching season but since i watched the bluray version of season season blurays arent out and i refuse to downgrade in quality ill have to pass on watching season with you for now hope thats understandable not a problem man feel free to hit me up once you do get them because im still willing
anime,not_removed,im glad youre enjoying it so far one my favorite things is the character interactions and chemistry so glad youre taking a liking to it
anime,not_removed,you dont have to feel bad aria isnt a show for everyone id never want to force someone to watch it if it wasnt their type of show at all you can consider the contract completed just for giving it a chance
anime,not_removed,great can you submit it im on mobile atm
anime,not_removed,agreed kujo is definitely one of the common reasons to dislike gosick as for victorique id say her development is some of the best once you learn more about her history and the show hits the second half as thats where it gets into the main story
anime,not_removed,yeah initial d just keeps on looking better and better with each season i started watching stardust crusader one episode in really it does look intriguing although the sudden introduction to stands caught me by surprise even though i knew about them before thanks gintama i thought the introduction to something like that would be more gradual but thats fine i guess since jojo does like to escalate things quite frequently looking forward to see whats next
anime,not_removed,i was able to look past kujo and gosick became one of my favorites i think i expressed myself wrong i enjoyed the show a lot besides its flaws and the second half is really worth it the only thing restricting me from giving it a higher score is the weak mc in the mystery category this one is definitely one of my favorites along with hyouka and below my overall favorite anime shinsekai yori which is sadly on your ptw list im up for another contract if you want either a double blind or something from our plan to watch lists
anime,not_removed,i just finished amanchu and am moving on to oregairu contracts for now i am planning to finish ubw tv series first then wait for the new heavens feel before starting on fatezero based on what i have read from google it is also going to be a good ride tohsaka rin has similar characteristics to my most favourite character futaki kanata from little busters ex so she is my most favourite character for the fate series for now i already know the back story for archer so i guess i have to reserve my judgement of him until i finish fatezero and the ubw tv series i am glad you enjoyed kyoukai no kanata and it is in my top anime just because of how much the anime has hope you will also enjoy chuunibyou since the romance in it is also quite sweet
anime,not_removed,my favorite anime film would be the garden of words shortly followed by wolf children and ghost in the shell
anime,not_removed,yeah my tastes are a bit strange and hard to figure out im sure youd come up with some ill like or you could throw a bunch of ideas out and i could pick and choose from them
anime,not_removed,schemingsaten that would be kind of weird not sure i want to try and watch two seasons of it in week i feel that show is best taken slowly probably pass on it sorry
anime,not_removed,great hope we both enjoy
anime,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomoddhopefulkingfisher you wanna submit the contract or should i
anime,not_removed,no problem at all like i said kiniro mosaic is already a long time on my ptw and i watched already episodes thanks for telling me your opinion i think about teekyuu i saw only the first two seasons that the high speed story telling is a great way for creating new jokes specially some which caricatures the plot line of a normal sol for example finding a solution for the i cant cook really well problem in seconds
anime,not_removed,sounds perfect to me cant wait to hear what you have to say about best girl shiki excitedyui god now i want to watch them again
anime,not_removed,sounds good do you want to submit the contract or should i
anime,not_removed,well ive already seen your lie but grimgar sounds good ill submit it
anime,not_removed,sounds great to me ill submit the contract
anime,not_removed,perfect see you next week fistbump
anime,not_removed,httpsmyanimelistnetanimelistmetalturnfukawa
anime,not_removed,i choose princess mononoke for you and kokoro for myself because thats the only movie that you nominated i will get to the others eventually fwiw my plan is to get everyone on ranime to watch all of the miyazaki movies i think princess mononoke is my favorite although howls moving castle and spirited away drive a hard bargain
anime,not_removed,yep ill go ahead and submit it
anime,not_removed,oh that sounds good i marathoned too much of sailor moon a while ack which forced a pause and i never picked it up again the desire for more has been coming back to me in recent weeks though and this would be the perfect kickstarter this time though if you dont mind ill take it a bit slower i marathoned the first seasons in a few weeks which led to the stop so this time id rather watch episodes a day and take my time which again mean itll take some time to finish i hope you dont mind that if not we should go with tamako market
anime,not_removed,can you do im on mobile also do want to watch the ova too both have one so we both would watch episodes
anime,not_removed,sweet then weve got a deal note that the specials should be watched in set order mal synopsis says how do you mind adding the contract im on mobile rn
anime,not_removed,oh shoot i didnt even notice sorry i meant gintama
anime,not_removed,basically black lagoon is made of small arcs that can stand on their own its more the desire to see more of the characters that would make you watch the season than a continuation of some story season doesnt end on a cliffhanger it ends on a finished arc in the end i just hope that you like it enough to make you want to watch the next season but if you dont like it its as good for a point to stop as any other
anime,not_removed,ahah take your time theres definitely points at which you cant stop binging though
anime,not_removed,submitted
anime,not_removed,tamako market sounds great thanks and sorry do you mind submitting the contract im on mobile rn if not ill add it later have fun
anime,not_removed,its not like i thought shirayuki didnt belong in the castle but in that thats what the show was trying to show us because she was an outsider i still disagree with this point tbh to me it seemed almost everyone accepts her there and the only person that seems to be against her in the end is zens older brother and hes more against the romantic element of their relationship more than her being there in the first place i think the reason shes accepted is s she earned her keep on her own by passing the herbalist examinations rather than her connections to zen as far as ive gotten there havent really been any strong moments apart from episode where this gets challenged i felt s her passing her exams on her own was a sign of strength as well personally theres also some stuff at the end of the season that fits the bill here that id rather not spoil not a problem man feel free to hit me up once you do get them because im still willing cool ill try to remember that
anime,not_removed,ok thank you so much 😄
anime,not_removed,did not know that trailer came out lol from what i saw the animation looks good and i saw a lot of characters from the first season as well its good to know the dub is good so when i decide to rewatch the show at some point i can check out the dub for myself
anime,not_removed,will do hope we both enjoy this season as much as the last
anime,not_removed,haha i actually got shinsekai yori on bluray during the black friday rightstuf sale but since i just moved back home i havent been able to watch it so maybe if we do another contract you can give that to me
anime,not_removed,surprising i found the garden of words to be fairly average with the exception of the animation wolf children and gits are great however not a critique just figured id share my thoughts
anime,not_removed,alright so i think ill give yougoing to go over on episodes so ill throw in the sakura films if youd like into mine episodes episodes episodes episodes total i think youll really like erin and kino kaiba is a risk but could turn out well but others i thought maybe and if you want can use as a replacement episode to replace erin i think youd probably like this a lot but for now decided to go with erin episodes to replace erin or episodes to replace kinokaiba episodes and film to replace kinokaiba episodes to replace kinokaiba episodes to replace kinokaiba
anime,not_removed,its fine dont worry although im fine with taking longer than week im sure someone will offer natsume later
anime,not_removed,i can offer you a normal natsume contract if you find something for me
anime,not_removed,i will do it lets do this faito
anime,not_removed,i look forward to seeing her in action shes looked like a best girl candidate for a long time now d hope you find yozakura crew fun as well contract submitted crazyhatgirlexcited theyll always be there for you to rewatch
anime,not_removed,ill be fine with you doing it
anime,not_removed,if you want some bad ass fun then the dub is good but looking at your list i think school anime is closer to your style so maybe if neither works i can still probably find something for you
anime,not_removed,oh ok ignore my other comment too
anime,not_removed,i didnt see on your list and when i dont see it i always recommend it although if you meant pick something off your ptw then i would say how about which ever one you want but if it sounds good to you then you can go ahead and submit it
anime,not_removed,wait i forgot i havent seen kokoro how about tonari no totoro princess mononoke sounds good to me
anime,not_removed,sweet thanks
anime,not_removed,i was under the same circumstances i watched too many episodes at once time and thus needed to take a break i probably wont binge it like i did the first seasons so i would rather take it maybe episodes a day as well
anime,not_removed,submitted im ok with adding in the ovas i didnt actually specify them on the contract though so hopefully thats not a problem hope we both enjoy
anime,not_removed,submitted thanks for the heads up with the specials the ranime watch order wiki also has an entry for it too hope we both enjoy
anime,not_removed,ill take you up on that ill submit the contract in a bit
anime,not_removed,okay sounds good to me do you mind watching then
anime,not_removed,ok well ive submitted a contract
anime,not_removed,am i submitting both or just the second one no problem and have fun too
anime,not_removed,yeah you can just drop it and move on thanks for the contract though geass was entertaining as hell
anime,not_removed,perfect just choose whatever you want me to see
anime,not_removed,well then erin kinos and kaiba it is hard to choose between erin and cross game but ill trust your instinct you can write up the contract if everything sounds good
anime,not_removed,cant wait crazyhatgirlexcited
anime,not_removed,submitted see you in next weeks thread
anime,not_removed,ill go with gosick so yeah thats it i guess contract submitted
anime,not_removed,that works do you know if the dub is decent ghibli is usually pretty good about it eg christian bale voiced howl in howls moving castle but im not sure about their older stuff
anime,not_removed,sweet weve got a deal then ill submit the contract
anime,not_removed,not at all sounds good to me too
anime,not_removed,both
anime,not_removed,ok since i didnt see any cour shows on your ptw that ive seen how about cour shows i was thinking since it is one of my favorite comedies and since its a good drama and season is coming this winter if thats good for you then ya wanna go ahead and submit it
anime,not_removed,ill have to get you for cross game at some other point then because if erin fails you may lose your trust for me as a rec person
anime,not_removed,yea go ahead thanks and dont worry about it happens to the best of us
anime,not_removed,ive always watched anime in sub but im sure its decent as it is popular to the west
anime,not_removed,everythings good ill submit the contract now
anime,not_removed,awesome lets not burn out

anime,not_removed,yes because seasonal break
anime,not_removed,i prefer for it to be on break no need to have poor quality because theyre putting out episodes every week let them rest so the next episode can have some quality
anime,not_removed,damn figured that was the case thanks for letting me know do you know if it will be back up next week
anime,not_removed,actually the anime is based off the light novels the manga came after the show and no i have all of the light novels and it didnt really skip anything volume is the main plot of the first arc until the game was defeated and volume is actually taken back throughout the arc and thats where you read the side plots about lisbeth yui and silica who werent mentioned in the original story volume is where the faerie arc begins the progressive novels which were written after delve into the time during sao that wasnt covered in the light novelsanime i havent read them yet but i want to whenever i can if youre interested in the sao premise you should try giving it a shot sao was by far my favorite arc and im a little peeved that it was moved along so quickly so im curious on how they expand it in the progressives
anime,not_removed,you just described why a lot of people have a problem with sao
anime,not_removed,it was based off a light novel series which is basically just a regular book the anime did skip a few things but for the most part it covered the events that happened in the source i havent read them myself but the author has been writing a light novel series called sword art online progressive where what happens on each floor is covered
anime,not_removed,the first months when everyone is freaking out and murdering each other this is basically what progressive is about
anime,not_removed,its adapted from the light novel no they didnt leave much out its just bad
anime,not_removed,it didnt really skip anything the only thing i can think of offhand that the show did skip was s that time when kirito met with kleins guild outside the area that people were taking turns powergrinding in im not sure why they left that part out other than maybe for time constraints but it was a good scene that helped flesh out the world a little more as well as reinforce kiritos solo nature
anime,not_removed,sao is an oddball for me to watch because im not that interested in anime i only watched this because a friend recommended it to me and i was interested in the premise but im continuing to watch it for the same reason i watch shitty bmovies its bizarrely facinating to me and i want to figure out how it was made and why i made it to the part that the main character was turned into a girl for no apparent reason and had zero impact on the plot and was never brought up again and had to quit after they shifted back to the fairies
anime,not_removed,is he trying to george lucas it
anime,not_removed,did you read the light novel it doesnt appear that you read the light novel from your comment edit okay i see where you are coming from i apologize for my antagonistic comment youre right that much was not left out at least to what was relevant to the story
anime,not_removed,for me the first months would have been the most interesting everyone is panicking and murdering each other and kirito badass swordwielding girlfriend cant remember her name and other mainish characters are working to organize some kind of order and get out i watch a lot of bmovies and have a tendency to rewrite or reimagine how i would do things that fascinate andor disappoint me ie star wars prequels
anime,not_removed,yeah what i meant by that was that nothing plot wise was skipped there were certainly details that they skipped i thought the explanation of the ethics alarm was pretty interesting but i dont think they mentioned it in the anime im assuming they did skip over those things for time constraints
anime,not_removed,i say they skipped a lot of stuff plot wise or just explained it in voiceover which is worse
anime,not_removed,im sure your opinion of anime has been even further shattered after seeing sao it is one of the most popular series for some reason but on this subreddit you will only really see it being shit on i would encourage you to try out the more recommended shows of this sub but i can understand if you dont think anime is for you given your previous view of it and your experience and yeah he turns into a girl cos traps are cute thats one of those weird anime things that i dont enjoy also everything to do with the fairies was beyond bad
anime,not_removed,the explanation of the ethics alarm ah yeah forgot about that asuna and lisbeth had a bit more time together in the ln than the anime i think they may have touched on it in the safe zone murder episode but not in the same context or details as in the ln
anime,not_removed,im sure your opinion of anime has been even further shattered after seeing sao actually no ive seen other ones they just usually have grimmerdarker premises im a huge fan of death note and attack on titan a friend recommended this and kill la kill at the same time ive finished kill la kill and enjoyed it although not for the story as much as it went over the top with absolutely everything and the fact that the main character didnt seem to give a shit about anything other than avenging her fathermurdering rainbow cruella deville girl cos traps are cute that pissed me off because their was so much you could do with that ie he runs into friends that keep asking whymaking fun of him random guys giving him tons of shit because hes a girl and the fairy stuff felt like they were chasing some popular trend to boost ratings i also thought it was odd that they took badass swordwielding girlfriend who i thought was a genuinely interesting character and slightly more useful than the main dude and relegated her to being a trophy with the first round of fairy stuff i have a list of changes i would do if i was in charge of this mess
anime,not_removed,i highly suggest the currently airing rezero i have managed to get a couple of my freinds who adamantly disliked anime into watching and having a complete on their opinin on anime after watching it
anime,not_removed,ill look into it thanks for the recommendation
anime,not_removed,a little preface about it rezero is based on a series of light novels which are based off a series of web novels written by an author who was tired of all the shitty trapped in a fantasy world light novels so he decided to right his own version of these kinds of stories and this is how rezero began everything about it is basically taking classic tropes and turning them on their head in a way its almost like the complete opposite of sao
anime,not_removed,that sounds genuinely interesting
anime,not_removed,it really is theres a reason the top posts with the most comments on ranime are rezero discussion threads
anime,not_removed,because of haremecchi anime and hentai
anime,not_removed,because as far as western society is concerned animation for kids
anime,not_removed,cause its an esoteric nerd thing that most people dont know shit about and dont care to look into so they form preconceived notions of what it is based on that episode of dbz they saw one time and some stuff they read on the internet about tentacles
anime,not_removed,varies depending from region to region and from culture to culture anime is fairly popular where i live but we have a significant asian culture
anime,not_removed,people are avoiding saying this but its a lot to do with the fanbase only a small section of it of course but youll find that anime fandom is very much associated with basement dwelling misogynist mra types with terrible hygiene and no social skills thats unfair on most fans for sure but it still represents a decent chunk of vocal annoying fans who try their best to ruin it for everyone gamergate for instance reinforced this with nonanime fans a very very significant portion of the most abusive and angry and misogynist gamergaters use anime characters as their online avatars usually a woman usually in some state of undress it mightnt be an accurate representation of all fans but to the ones copping abuse it sure as hell seems to be a connecting factor like it or not thats how a lot of people outside the anime fandom see those on the inside and anime fans as a whole are pretty reliable about reinforcing that stereotype whenever they get a chance
anime,not_removed,yeah that seems to be the biggest opinion among my antianime friends
anime,not_removed,i like how this contrasts so hard with the tentacle porn perception
anime,not_removed,true there have been more and more adult or teen shows coming out though which im glad about such as rick and morty and other like it
anime,not_removed,unfortunately yeah a lot of people are afraid to try things that have been labeled as bad some of my friends who adored avatar as kids and still think its a great show today wont watch anything out of japan because it has the anime label despite the clear anime influences
anime,not_removed,thats great to hear my school has roughly kids that watch anime and like more that wont hate you for watching it i do live in a small town though not much diversity here
anime,not_removed,this is something that my friends are very vocal about and i can see why i personally have issues with people who try to force their interests onto other people by this i dont mean suggesting something to a friend or similar i mean the type of person who waves there interests in your face begging you to disagree with them unfortunately your right and that personality can turn people off of something all together
anime,not_removed,not to mention some haremecchihentai have characters which look younger than and some are actually younger than in those situations so now youve got the cheese pizza issue
anime,not_removed,teens think tentacle porn parents think kids stuff
anime,not_removed,ya that sounds similar to my friends town i was actually pretty surprised to hear that there were quite a few people in rural areas that watched anime
anime,not_removed,yeah this honestly disturbs me quite a bit as well at times
anime,not_removed,yeah the internet has a way of making location mostly irrelevant so it happens there will always be some people that watch anime its just a matter of how many
anime,not_removed,its a different director and staff for every short whilst the series is produced at signal md its not the regular staff instead inviting specialist animators to work on their own short its basically the animator expo of pokemon no staff lists have been released but the cavern was directed by attack on titan animator arifumi imai the animation supervisor for the suicune short was senbon umishima the director of the episode was kazuyoshi yaginuma
anime,not_removed,it is olm inc edit this is wrong refer below for actual studio
anime,not_removed,have you seen the kalos league battles that animation is top notch granted not the whole xy and xyz series are as so but if you do want to see some good main series animation check out the semi finals and finals of the kalos league
anime,not_removed,you wouldnt happen to know who worked on the old chateau would you cause that one was rather well done
anime,not_removed,oh wow great info thanks i need to start knowing directors
anime,not_removed,wikipedia is incorrect its produced at signal md
anime,not_removed,and yes they are the ones who do the regular pokemon anime as well
anime,not_removed,yeah i did hear that xyxyz have better animation than the previous ones i might give it a go sees episode number sees other anime backlog cries
anime,not_removed,afraid not i believe the staff are not allowed to say who worked on the project except for themselves
anime,not_removed,thank you but must say i havent heard about them
anime,not_removed,thanks for the correction
anime,not_removed,and by that definition its anime right
anime,not_removed,theyre fairly new its a digital studio thats a part of ig port so many of the contacts are those that have worked with ig and wit in the past
anime,not_removed,none of those names are outlandish at all and as far as i know which admittedly isnt particularly far they are not uncommon
anime,not_removed,or if you play kc you could tell forgotkeys i dont even play kancolle and i could tell too many kancolle doujins i guess
anime,not_removed,all imperial japanese warships or if you play kc you could tell yeah its true though it was mostly ars nova rather than kancolle for me
anime,not_removed,those were just some examples but theres more from fuuka like tamachan or nachi senpai its not just in fuuka but the main characters in suzuka too some even pop up in kimi no iru machi
anime,not_removed,everyone learns about kancolle through one some form haha
anime,not_removed,gintama if you really want to make a commitment
anime,not_removed,osomatsusan space dandy
anime,not_removed,osomatsusan
anime,not_removed,working servant x service hataraku maousama amagi brilliant park arakawa under the bridge a good part of the first season of bungou stray dogs
anime,not_removed,ive rewatched it lots of times always cracks me up and its short episodes of min each the setting is kinda like konosuba but imo not as good still funny though watched this a long time ago kinda crazy if i remember well and pretty funny id like to put and which are in school but are very different from the usual school setting comedy
anime,not_removed,the devil is a part timer is definitely worth your time shame that there isnt a second season though
anime,not_removed,working if you enjoy what you see youre in luck because there are seasons and a spinoff show
anime,not_removed,this season we have it is in my top of the season so far mal is not that generous though
anime,not_removed,kill la kill may have its drama and its action but it all revolves around an absurdist comedy
anime,not_removed,not sure if prison school would suit your need it is very ecchi and the setting is a school but it is still not really a school as there is also a prison
anime,not_removed,sakamoto desu ga girls arent cute most of the characters are guys hilarious and clever same thing baccano black comedy bananya main characters are cats plastic neesan entire series is only half an hour girls arent that cute has decent male cast konjiki no gash bell funny kids actionshounen anime
anime,not_removed,arakawa under the bridge
anime,not_removed,but shows arent worth watching if they dont have cute girls doing cute things
anime,not_removed,all i could think of here is nourin its kinda set in a school but most of it revolves around an idol trying to into farm life and with a fairly even ratio of guys to girls plus it doeant really focus on cuteness i found it to be more on the sexy side than cute literally all i could think of a dude already mentioned a bunch so yeah it might not suit you
anime,not_removed,level e is pretty great if you can handle it
anime,not_removed,theres always inferno cop
anime,not_removed,its not really a commitment you can always just stop watching
anime,not_removed,the statue of liberty spaceship gets me every time
anime,not_removed,i totally watched amagi brilliant park for the girls but its kyoani so kanyesama is cute too s and tiramie macaron are dudes shockingly
anime,not_removed,i dont recommend amagi really bad
anime,not_removed,how is the spinoff show im on episode and it seems hard to get into compared to the original
anime,not_removed,well the commitment would be to not stop watching it since it can take quite a few episodes to get into
anime,not_removed,after seasons of growing into the cast of the original series its going to be jarring having to get into a whole new cast of characters their quirks and their shenanigans its an adjustment for sure and once you realize that you realize its the same great working that you know
anime,not_removed,the dead silence after the golem shows up killed me so hard the first time i saw it baka and test is one of my top reccomended for comedies because the gags are so well exicuted in the show the first big one with the superglueing hand to the table was what sold me on the show orignally everyone should watch it
anime,not_removed,how i miss this anime we need a new season of this one
anime,not_removed,i honestly remember nothing about this show other than thinking it was decent but whenever someone posts a scene from it i usually find it funny maybe i should give it a rewatch or at least add it to the pile with the other fifty fucking shows i need to rewatch
anime,not_removed,minami is still best girl
anime,not_removed,representing class f takaradasalute
anime,not_removed,speaking about baka to test is akin to summoning me by my username though if i can pick the kings game is probably the most hilarious scene
anime,not_removed,if you guys liked baka to test you should check out its author latest work its amazing mc goes to college and joins his uncles diving club gets drunk and naked with his fellow club members no homo hilarious
anime,not_removed,rewatched it just weeks ago also read most of the ln the best comedy anime in my opinion though comedy is a very subjectiv matter
anime,not_removed,fuck whoever styled those subs fuck them right in the eyes
anime,not_removed,i may have to rewatch this now
anime,not_removed,baka to test was a funny anime might have to rewatch it
anime,not_removed,flat is justice most of the time but i like the pink haired girl better so in order to not betray the flat masterrace i pick hideyoshi as best girl
anime,not_removed,i certainly am baka and test is my favourite this brings back some great memories however as good as mizuki was minami shimada all the way
anime,not_removed,i loved this show even my friend who isnt a big slapstick fan liked it
anime,not_removed,i love fast paced comedies baka and test dfrag my bride is a mermaid ect all have a special place in my heart
anime,not_removed,is this season or season
anime,not_removed,baka and test is easily my second favorite comedy right after sora no otoshimono watched this show dubbed and the vas were phenomenal
anime,not_removed,i loved the first season the second season not so much i wanted to see more summoning wars because they were the thing that got me into the series in the first place ln ended on a pretty funny note at least to me
anime,not_removed,oh man the memorys are returning age since i watched baka to test
anime,not_removed,great anime always got me laughing
anime,not_removed,anyone know why there isnt a third season
anime,not_removed,the whole school festival arc was the best one for me
anime,not_removed,hello anyone who wants something similar as a manga should read grand blue its from the same author and is freaking hilarious with great art the characters are college students too
anime,not_removed,this show is literally my anime ive watched since i started watching anime continously
anime,not_removed,this entire anime was hillariousnot as hilalrious as prison school but hillarious enough to be recommendable for everyone who wants comedy
anime,not_removed,i know man its so funny it hits all the right notes the hideyoshi being his sister for a day episode and her him the miss yukata contest haha funniest anime ive seen so sad no season
anime,not_removed,the author is doing a manga about diving but mostly its about nudists getting drunk in college
anime,not_removed,pls fund one
anime,not_removed,its one of those shows that once it ends you feel empty
anime,not_removed,years ago i remember caving in and just reading the light novel translation i still have a tiny spark of hope left for a season
anime,not_removed,honestly rewatch it takes the piss out of anime tropes and just about everything cross dressing taking the piss out of pervs celebrating pervs clever comedy and a dumbass as main protagonist its way out humour if you want a laugh i recommend there is a guy they give his own gender to need i say more httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvormksctmnc
anime,not_removed,hideyoshi is still best hideyoshi
anime,not_removed,flat chested girls life
anime,not_removed,nah it is shouko
anime,not_removed,you got it
anime,not_removed,damn straight nigga
anime,not_removed,but hideyoshi isnt a girl hes a hideyoshi
anime,not_removed,season i think
anime,not_removed,really you didnt hate the end like i did i despise the light novel ending
anime,not_removed,also hideyoshi is a gender he cant use boys room and he wont use girls room because he is a he the beach episode was funny not allowed to go topless like a boy
anime,not_removed,a good anime similar to baka to test i actually think its even better would be dfrag both being topnotch comedies i just cant help but think dfrag improves on the bt formula
anime,not_removed,i will never truly live until i see baka test fully adapted
anime,not_removed,natsume got another season after years and berserk although horrendous as it is got another season theres always hope
anime,not_removed,i cant remember his name but the purple haired cameraman was best character no question i think it started with tsu
anime,not_removed,second best pairing after minamixaki
anime,not_removed,flat is justice
anime,not_removed,good taste
anime,not_removed,hideyoshi is best hideyoshi
anime,not_removed,i seriously dont remember seeing this scene in season for whatever reason
anime,not_removed,theres seasons are both as hilarious
anime,not_removed,natsume yuujinchou and berserk are still ongoing though the for baka and test finished last year and the author is already working on a
anime,not_removed,mutsulini
anime,not_removed,pervert ninja thats all i know him as and all ill ever need to know him as
anime,not_removed,hideyoshi is love hideyoshi is life
anime,not_removed,theyre gems that we are not worthy of having
anime,not_removed,looks interesting i wonder what hilarious situations he came up with in this one
anime,not_removed,thats the one aka kouta tsuchiya
anime,not_removed,theres also ova that goes in between seasons
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,opinions are pretty mixed about it thats for sure still the atmosphere was top tier and was my favorite part about it it pretty much carried the show honestly
anime,not_removed,if i did not find the deaths in another so hilarious i probably would have stopped watching early on the deaths are what made the show for me
anime,not_removed,the time i brought it up i got mixed responses i agree its a good show but there isnt much character development you just dont have enough time to get attached to the characters to feel something when they die i still think izumi shouldnt have died i was like damn the story is going to develop but no she died a tsundere she could a have lived a tsundere but she was all tsun and no dere i just realized what ticked me off most it was how vauge the curse was it wasnt explained if memory loss happened to people who visited the town and left or if pictures and external records were also modified would the provincial government notice inconsistencies in records why didnt they close down the school or just skip the class number and transfer all the members to another school or just have only a class in name certainly parents would be outraged once they heard of the curse theyd probably demand the school closed or their students transferred to another class
anime,not_removed,ye i liked it too i wouldnt actually compare it too erased though erased is more of a mysterythriller for me while another is straight out going for horror genre if i were to compare it with something maybe dusk maiden of amnesia since that one felt like it escelated pretty quickly too however they really fasten up the pace at some point basicly shit hits the fan i am not opposed to this but a lot of people feel like anime are rushed whenever something like this happens one thing another did much better than erased though was in my opinion to keep you guessing about the identity of the ghost i feel like erased was way to obvious for everyone to see still liked both shows tho
anime,not_removed,the remaining of the show got really silly
anime,not_removed,umbrella need i say more i lost my shit with that one
anime,not_removed,i think the biggest issue was that it escalated too quickly and rather poorly at the end the atmosphere which was so good in the beginning just died as quickly and brutally as the characters then by the time the plot twist was learned it just didnt have the impact it could have i think the burning building was a detriment to the setting for sure obviously it had to end with the students going crazy and starting to kill each other that was expected i think how it happenedstarted could have been handled better
anime,not_removed,spoilers obviously
anime,not_removed,i think the umbrella one was legitimately shocking being the first but every one after that just seemed comical
anime,not_removed,i saw that scene before watching the show and kept wondering when it would show up i guess ill have to dig the ova up
anime,not_removed,kid drowned got hit by a boat then died of an aneurysm that is funny level of overkill
anime,not_removed,i like code geass a lot or at least not as much but its got that cool ending so theres that lulu is one of my favorite characters in anime and cc is mai waifu s jibun wooooooooooooo
anime,not_removed,it depends in the person you ask but usually people are in of camps some people think the show is absolute trash and other people think the show is a masterpiece i personally fall into the latter camp
anime,not_removed,took me few rewatches to really appreciate geass for how good it is to clean myself from all negativity imprinted on me by internet people who think every twist means shit writting and asspull great show and i still have hope for more lelouchs adventures
anime,not_removed,one of my favorite shows despite all of its faults though really it could still do away with a couple of shitty characters
anime,not_removed,its really fun if you dont take it seriously there were actually some great moments and characters but a lot of plot holes and lolz moments between s i still crack up remembering a mass genocide was caused by a single accident
anime,not_removed,its pretty hype but falls apart the more you think about it id say that the enjoyment of cg is proportional to the amount of bullshit youre able to tolerate like mixing war drama with high school antics or passing asspulls as clever strategies since despite all of the holes in its writing it manages to be really entertaining again depending on how much ridiculousness youre able to take
anime,not_removed,i like the first season not so much the second season lelouch is probably in my top or favorite characters and despite not liking the second season too much i thought the ending was fantastic
anime,not_removed,i watched around episodes thought lelouche was kind of a dick joked about it in a forum and a bunch of asshats spoiled the whole thing arguing lelouche is a saint or something havent touched it since then
anime,not_removed,its my favourite anime i love pretty much everything about it the only part i didnt was cs world stuff and that kind of thing towards the end they didnt explain what was going in there very well lelouch is my favourite character from anything aside from walter white from breaking bad his character was by far the main thing for me what did you think of how he developed throughout it
anime,not_removed,i watched the first season it was ok i guess the way things are solved seemed a bit farfetched pulled out of thin air kind of thing it didnt interest me enough to watch the season at the time but i may get round to finishing them off one day
anime,not_removed,its a trainwreck but can be fun for the ride
anime,not_removed,one of my favourite anime tbh i gave and to the seaons but i guess depends a lot on the person
anime,not_removed,its a show that will be remembered more by how far it managed to take its story than by how meaningful or powerful the story was
anime,not_removed,i fall into a third camp im shocked at a lot of people calling the show a masterpiece when it has a ridiculous amount of problems fan service shitty high school dramas that are filler moral dilemmas that are contrived and make no real sense the absolute ridiculous amount of advertisement however the show has a lot of good things good things that obviously cant be ignored there are good plot twists and good turns that actually are pretty interesting but all the shitty episodes poorly written plots hurt it a lot theres another show fma that has similar shit plot but it has a difference its characters were deep and realistic and deeply human code geass never is able to explore the same moral dilemmas because its mostly contrived and makes no sense but that doesnt make it a trainwreck but whenever i see it called a masterpiece i lose more trust in the anime community
anime,not_removed,it was good for one watch do not rewatch
anime,not_removed,its fun doesnt make sense but fun
anime,not_removed,hello i really liked put on hold at episode and never looked back that second season was a complete trainwreck imo i hear that it has a really good ending so i plan on finishing iteventually
anime,not_removed,just dont rewatch it i watched it the first time and gave it a but apon rewatch you notice the well extreme amount of plot devices like theyre absolutely everywhere and kinda ruin the show for me
anime,not_removed,far too many cheap plot devices and far too many onedimensional characters ripped down a story that should have been a lot better intriguing worldbuilding semidecent storytelling in parts and a good soundtrack but still flawed in a whole bunch of different ways then the second season arrived and the wheels came off
anime,not_removed,first season was mediocre second season was unbearable i hate fun things
anime,not_removed,the plot is a huge mess takes an already messy plot to ridiculous levels and the train wreck is quite noticeable characters are generally bad with the exception of lelouch who isnt particularly fantastic was previously a fan but after rewatching i stopped liking it
anime,not_removed,like mixing war drama with high school antics or passing asspulls as clever strategies and this is why i cant see it as fun it takes itself too seriously in my opinion
anime,not_removed,thats one way to put it but honestly depends on what youre considering as thinking about it since not everyone has the same interests petpeeves or priorities much less the same approaches to thinking about it to put it lightly for instance id argue the show does lack realism and thats very easy to criticize in a dozen ways if you really want to dig into that side of the narrative youll obviously keep finding an endless list of details that arent realistic and further thinking on that level will only reveal more issues but there are actually a few other aspects of the show that can and do start to make more internal sense after you think about them especially thematically speaking and also in terms of the protagonists progression even if such aspects are still surrounded by crazy or otherwise ridiculous situations not everything is automatically illogical in fact id argue there is a method to the madness at work and that rather than falling apart actually helps pull everything together evidently i have no issues with the decision to combine warfare high school robots and overthetop tactics imo they could only seen as particularly clever inuniverse like in other series with impossible plans such as most of jojo in the same show some people cant deal with that and i am not telling them to change their minds but i dont think thats even remotely close to falling apart since such a widereaching mix and the resulting entertaining presentation was always a key part of the mission statement for this production
anime,not_removed,the first half of second season was just forgettable but i thought it gets pretty good halfway through i think everything from s shirleys death onward
anime,not_removed,you could certainly say that but id say there is at least some impressive power in certain scenes like the ending that isnt necessarily empty of all meaning nothing incredibly deep or original of course not yet worthwhile enough so that it can still resonate with quite a few people
anime,not_removed,did you enjoy the first two episodes or so and then ended up getting bored around because thats what happened to me i dropped around episode then i decided to go back to it a few weeks later and to this day its my favourite anime
anime,not_removed,the ending really makes up for it i was in the same boat but im a weird must finish kind of guy and it killed the ending
anime,not_removed,you have flcl as a you cant hate fun things and hate flcl
anime,not_removed,conversely like ive stated above rewatching the series not just once but several times has actually helped me appreciate it then again i doubt my initial experience or my set of expectations and general approach was the same as yours i was already a fan of anime for years and was lucky enough to watch the series within an online community that had access to a bunch of translated materials most casual viewers have never even seen in a few words much of messiness seems quite straightforward to me in retrospect its still messy but not illogical in purpose that is regarding its underlying objectives you really could sum up the effective goal of of the second season in one phrase once you figure that out id say its not too hard to connect the dots back to season one again provided were not discussing any questions of realism here and on the contrary id say lelouch is pretty great but most of the cast is passable they fulfill their required roles and a few do them do stand out properly even though suzakus very easy to hate upon rewatch ive found him increasingly interesting though still not necessarily likable
anime,not_removed,frankly i just dont agree with that point of view and neither would the creative staff but lets leave appeals to authority and the related evidence out of the way for now there are a bunch of very dramatic moments within the story to be sure but id argue the presentation is mostly theatrical and overthetop rather than truly serious and at the same time there are multiple elements which are clearly intended to tone down the seriousness and emphasize a more lighthearted or otherwise whimsical nature during all manner of sequences in various ways i felt the series itself was almost screaming at the audience that no you dont need to take everything in this universe seriously regardless of the protagonists more stoic attitude in fact the show had no qualms about making fun of lelouch for example including but not limited to the whole cat chasing incident or making him hilariously weak on the physical front plus lloyd orangekun and multiple other things
anime,not_removed,which is also the reason i dont plan to rewatch it ill keep it as one of my fun times when i was just getting into anime and didnt actually care since everything amazed me
anime,not_removed,probably a bit of an exaggeration but i think the first half is forgettable is because it felt like it repeated the second half of the first season just to get back to where we were one could argue s that since lelouch lost most of everything that he needed to struggle through again but i kind of find that somewhat a stretch and as for the rest of its fun but kind of stupid at the same time and depending on how seriously you take it effects it
anime,not_removed,im confused by all the people calling it a masterpiece or comparing it to the good parts of death note death note was focused not too many big big plot holes and its theme was actually thought out code geass aims too high and clearly wasnt able to handle it
anime,not_removed,i found suzaku to be a far better character than lelouch and changing the system from within was a far better strategy which didnt require bullshit plot convenience to work
anime,not_removed,the greatest single plot hole in the whole entire show is making britannia seem good or zero to be somehow bad this comes from the first episodes which literally shows them killing thousands of innocents for basically no reason i equate them to being nazis and so should everyone else uk stopped colonizing because they lost military power thats right violence and rebellion kicked them out all the ghandi peace talk completely forget the violent part of indias path towards independence as far as i know nazis and the colonial british bastards deserved to be killed even if evil must be used nazis must be stopped simple as that
anime,not_removed,well thats your loss i had already gotten into anime several years before the airing but ive still rewatched the show myself and had a blast aside from doing enough research on the behindthescenes stances of the staff and being lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time in order to easily access said information which in my opinion is what ultimately destroys any argument that they were ever taking the show totally seriously or somehow expecting that out of their audience
anime,not_removed,well if you want stupid you cant get worse than s the finale of where great tragedies and genocide was caused by a single accident of lelouch geassing euphemia
anime,not_removed,statistics would suggest otherwise but then again i dont consider it a masterpiece either i simply think theres more to the theme among other things than what youre giving it credit for
anime,not_removed,then i guess our disagreement in that specific area remains even if it is one of degrees i can definitely explain why suzaku is interesting to me when analyzing his characters beyond his intended methods being reformist rather than rebellious neither of which is automatically wrong in theory btw but id still consider lelouch better theres more things to say like ive said i am not bothered by overthetop plans nor overthetop fightingpiloting skills though either of those can be seen as socalled plot conveniences depending on how you wish to approach them but i felt they were fitting for the largerthanlife context and theatrical presentation since those were both equally overthetop much of the time of course stuff like spinkicking turrets isnt supposed to be very realistic in the first place
anime,not_removed,with all due respect i dont really categorize that as a plot hole britannia is definitely portrayed as more evil than good within this fictional universe however there are still specific individuals who can be relatively reasonable and therefore not that bad thats all theyre merely exceptions that prove the rule its neither the first nor the last anime that reflects this sort of contrast as for your real life exampleseven speaking as someone with a professional degree in history which hasnt helped me much yet but i digress i dont think the show needed to follow any particular historical pattern of which there are several not just one to the letter
anime,not_removed,how did this recording of me get on youtube
anime,not_removed,it begins i welcome our new fanart overlord
anime,not_removed,im excited shielder looks great i love her aesthetic

anime,not_removed,thats not how you spell scathachjeanne
anime,not_removed,indeed my fren kouhai mashu best gril indeed
anime,not_removed,not happening and from what ive heard of the light novels thats a good thing
anime,not_removed,there isnt any info and there will likely never be a second season on top of the fact the show ended rather conclusively there isnt much more source material i believe that there is a little bit extra in ln form however it isnt any where near enough to make another season with if youre looking for another show with a similar feel to pet girl i recommend toradora oregairu golden time and chunnibyou
anime,not_removed,there hasnt been any information on a season and i personally dont think any will ever come ive heard from people who have read the novels i think thats what it is based off that it gets pretty bad
anime,not_removed,no it will never happen ever

anime,not_removed,this saturday i went to an animemanga fair in barcelona spain for first time since i started watching anime last year i never bought something anime related before because i dont like to buy stuff online so that was my chance to buy some merchandising and well i like kon a lot so why not commemorate this first time with some awesome merch from that series d first i bought a best girl nn looks like that its from the anniversary of kon so from i really like how it looks but i will admit it while i prefer yui when i saw this i just went running there and i bought it without even doubting a second its jibrilfetish jibrilfetish i will be honest i love plushies since always and seeing this one made me so happy best buy of the year no doubt i keep awwwing and hugging it all day years male here not sure how to feel im really happy for going there and the merch i bought is so awesome my moe thirst is satisfied for now still crying because i looked everywhere for stuff of my waifu himeko inaba but there was nothing at all i already went there expecting the worst about this but i still feel dead inside for this happening shatteredsaten

anime,not_removed,my first piece of tangible merch its a book called stray dog of anime the films of mamoru oshii by brian ruh if liking his films wasnt pretentious enough reading about his films surely will make me the elitist weeb ive always wanted to be silliness aside im genuinely curious about his career
anime,not_removed,a few bds came in httpimgurcomaezfgy
anime,not_removed,whelp if i wasnt already ive definitely fallen into the deep end now after weeks of shipping my first dakimakura pillow case has arrived today happy halloween everyone apologies for subpotato quality image my phone and only camera is old enough to still have a physical keyboard and sweet sliding action

anime,not_removed,nice the banpresto anniversary figures are fun ive got the azusa one myself
anime,not_removed,great taste im looking at picking up the ritsu figma soon myself i would get the anniversary figure but i want a drumset too
anime,not_removed,aoba a cute nice pickup
anime,not_removed,looks awesome man thanks for posting
anime,not_removed,hopefully you find there useful in your future figuremerch hunts
anime,not_removed,cool momoka is definitely one of my favorite female lead character
anime,not_removed,man do you really need to inform me of things i now must have and did you get it
anime,not_removed,depends where you live takes generally weeks to get my orders im guessing days though
anime,not_removed,ill say a month when i shipped something to brazil thats about how long it took
anime,not_removed,ill say weeks probably wrong but meh
anime,not_removed,weeks i think your proposal about weeks will correlate with your first shipping but because its christmas time then it will need a little bit longer ohhh i am sorry for you if i am right
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,the drum set was a bit over my price range but this was pretty decent price wise so i went with this figure
anime,not_removed,i dont have it yet i did feel the need to mention it here in case a few people here are unaware of it it is a shame though there was not a post announcing the bluray release though
anime,not_removed,edit oh yeah i live in south america btw bookdepository gives days prediction forgot to include the most important part thanks
anime,not_removed,ah yeah theres a super fancy static figure of ritsu with the drums thats pretty pricy but the figma is a reasonable enough price for me are you planning on picking up the rest of the girls ps happy birthday
anime,not_removed,thanks for answering and thanks for posting man
anime,not_removed,thanks and im not sure yet they arent too expensive and i never considered it
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomivrwctzgifv
anime,not_removed,id like to try and get the whole band together in figure form but its a long term goal of mine id be happy with just ritsu for now
anime,not_removed,thats extremely vague that narrows it down to a ton of haremsromances ill guess its nisekoi
anime,not_removed,given how many shows are this way it would be incredibly difficult to find out this one
anime,not_removed,this is like of all the anime any hints like year hair color length more than one season
anime,not_removed,does she know how old the anime is was it ecchi were there multiple romance interests does she have a description of what any of the characters look like
anime,not_removed,is it toradora the intro changes halfway through the series maybe your sister got confused thought there were two seasons because of the different intros
anime,not_removed,my best guest is ao haru ride
anime,not_removed,thats like of nisekoi but idk if thats the right one
anime,not_removed,does she know if they didnt get along at first or did they like each other from the get go anything simple that could help narrow it down
anime,not_removed,was it a shojo anime maybe this
anime,not_removed,kimi ni todoke
anime,not_removed,thought it was but you said it has seasond with multiple episodes
anime,not_removed,love hina
anime,not_removed,and its seasons but only about episodes each
anime,not_removed,ai yori aoishi
anime,not_removed,if its really not nisekoi im kinda dissapointed in originality of some anime
anime,not_removed,yeah i have to agree with ya on this one
anime,not_removed,she said it was about two seasons episodes each no english release but she saw it on youtube about years ago she described it as being cute so it wasnt any kind of mature series
anime,not_removed,nope not that one
anime,not_removed,yeah thats what i thought too but it only has one season so
anime,not_removed,she said that wasnt it
anime,not_removed,she says they were young when they met and liked each other they drifted apart and met again years later
anime,not_removed,nope
anime,not_removed,nope she says its a similar plot though
anime,not_removed,nope
anime,not_removed,oreimo the titles long ore no imouto ga konnani kawaii wake ga nai
anime,not_removed,kanon edit kimi no iru machi

anime,not_removed,god was so good
anime,not_removed,hey op you should submit these to ranimethemes if you havent already just make sure to tag them properly check the sidebar
anime,not_removed,another commendation for the dub from me it surprisingly didnt take long to get used to after moving from the subs the dialogue felt fluid and the voices fit the characters rather decently
anime,not_removed,really makes me want to rewatch the whole series again but it wasnt that long ago i watched both it and the version im trying to hold out for the whole series to be dubbed the first ed was probably my favourite ending out of them all
anime,not_removed,why was there not a clean edop on the jap blu ray tho
anime,not_removed,you can smile again the opening and endings of hunter x hunter are top tier
anime,not_removed,rengehype
anime,not_removed,this brings me back to when i first started watching this series good times
anime,not_removed,both op and ed look really good also after episodes i completely forgot that killua is a skater
anime,not_removed,my friend and i love headbanging when the beat kicks it super fun
anime,not_removed,this are the same guys that did the style is very similar edit talking about the song

anime,not_removed,we dont know the only information thats out so far is that its being made
anime,not_removed,if it comes out this year id be betting on winter but who knows edit winter next year is the soonest i think itll come out

anime,not_removed,but winter is next year
anime,not_removed,woops lol ill have to correct that
anime,not_removed,not really a lot of the jokes are anime specific and the r rated content is too much particularly the pantie snatching boob physics dont help either konosuba is a solid series but nothing that would be a break out in the west
anime,not_removed,things dont get popular in the west without dubs unless some freak occurrence happens just look at slayers it was fairly similar to konosuba but it focused more on adventuring than skits but still had a ton of jokes and it pretty much became the go to fantasy anime of the but it had a dub and a few big budget movies to kick it along
anime,not_removed,it maybe somewhat popular in the west compared to other comedy anime but i doubt the merchandise and blueraydvd will click and sell here even dubbed it wont ever reach the mainstream and merchandise status of opdbgundamaot and sao
anime,not_removed,whats your definition of a popular anime in the west
anime,not_removed,theres far too much weeb humor in konosuba for it to be mainstream
anime,not_removed,i really want the world to see the light of kemono friends but i doubt its gonna happen
anime,not_removed,gurren lagann and code geass had dubs early on
anime,not_removed,gurren laggen got a dub in less than a year code geass was a year and change i didnt know one person who knew about either until it aired on television back in the day mainstream isnt internet communities dedicated to anime mainstream is people that dont normally watch anime i really doubt people who dont normally watch anime were pirating anime back then
anime,not_removed,so rainbow mode is so hax that it can destroy another idols aura though at least i cant say i was surprised laura lost again there was clearly no way for her to overcome yume when she can just pull that out again still somewhat annoying though wonder if they are actually going to write out koharu for a time though and it seems like yume will face the backlash of this weeks performance in the next episode going by that pv
anime,not_removed,as powerful as yumes rainbow mode is i dont think its so powerful that it can destroy another idols aura on its own to me it looked like laura got distracted by yumes rainbow mode and lost some focus on the performance and thats what caused her aura to disappear anyways the writing for this episode seemed lazy to me i understand that they wanted to give laura some character development but having yume overpower her using her rainbow mode again to catalyze the development felt kind of cheap at least this seemed to strengthen yume and lauras bond because if theres one thing i cant stand its unnecessary tension between characters
anime,not_removed,overall the episode was enjoyable but yumes unexplained magical voice enhancing aura still bothers me i just want laura to beat yumes rainbow shenanigans in the near future i wont accept her winning as a result of koharu leaving laura destroying yumes rainbow aura if thats what happened next time would be an interesting turn of events nothing against yume shes just been winning everything as of late it would be nice if koharu got a performance before she leaves but i dont really expect her to as long as she isnt forgotten for ages its fine
anime,not_removed,a full hours till i can watch this edit a decent episode but it hurts about to see laura lose to yume yet again i like laura quite a bit more than yume and the day laura again stands on top ill smile a lot as for koharu it would be really sad if she went to italy im still dreaming of the day she finds the recipe to be great and start challenging yume laura and the others
anime,not_removed,i cant say i was surprised laura lost again there was clearly no way for her to overcome yume when she can just pull that out again one of my main problems with this show is that currently only two people are able to use the seemingly unbeatable rainbow hax mode yume can apparently sing better than another with admittedly better technical skill on a relatively small amount of practice i cant imagine what it would be like when shes practiced for longer hopefully others are capable of using a similar aura or its beatable with a similar level of skill i prefer everybody competing at to yume deciding when somethings not important enough to win
anime,not_removed,mmm you could have a point there with laura having been distracted by yume but yeah wasnt really a fan of how the episode played out myself either
anime,not_removed,how about trying out the currently airing
anime,not_removed,boku no hero academia airing this season its got a very comic book feel to it
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,thanks i have watched op man and really like it but i think he would rater have dub over a sub ill try boku no hero academia
anime,not_removed,i watched the first episode of boku no hero academia i like it almost feels like xmen in reverse
anime,not_removed,it could help if you got info on a few more specific tastes i get you are probably going with the idea of cape hero but outside of that the things i would recommend to a doctor strange fan is pretty different from what i would recommend to a punisher fan
anime,not_removed,how about its pretty much a superhero show already
anime,not_removed,he loves nearly everything from batman to deadpool although i would like something with little fanservice violence etc when he was younger there was a man in the same county that he lived in that murdered a young child and guess what the murderer was obsessed with hentai so i know he might be one of the people that believes the stereotypical boobs and blood anime thanks
anime,not_removed,bricks of ramen and a train pass
anime,not_removed,about tree fiddy
anime,not_removed,my anecdotal evidence from people i know and a bunch of years ago was the average was about million yen for midlevel animators and about million yen for newer animators there are obviously outliers far above and below these levels seems to support my anecdotal evidence though it is from a few years ago as well as for the cost per episode it depends a lot on the studio publishers partners and resources for instance a small studio will incur much greater costs if they need to work with a lot of outside help outside help usually charges more and you need people especially in production to handle those relationships which is more overhead overall there are tons of people involved in most modern anime especially for more wellknown and bigger studios compared to all the people in the chain increasing an animators salary is relatively negligible in a lot of cases while the opposite in others some anime are making billions of yen millions of dollars in revenue the issue of feasibility would be more dependent on total accounting for all the costs involved of which again animators comprise a small amount as the scale of the production increases even if an anime is making lots of revenue that does not guarantee lots of profit the final determining factor will be profit and indeed a lot of high grossing anime likely dont end up with tremendous amounts of profit remember that often debt holders investors partners parent companies and other entities and liabilities need to get their share on top of internal costs theres also the basic issue of paying the salary of all the people in the aforementioned chain within the company or at a partner production staff directors sound music editors voice actors hr accounting finance and many other departments and groups the point is making anime is not just paying animators and voice actors a lot of people are involved in a production which drives costs up quickly as scope and requirements increase depending on the anime production requirements what i am saying is theres no real way to know without looking closely at the financials of the studios employing animators as a whole the market generally sets the price often meaning that salaries are low for a multitude of possible reasons while i cant speak to what the exact reasons are since im not currently living in japan one can expect the common ones that exist across media production everyone wants to be in the industry there are limited amounts of positions some companies are already at capacity or over budgetin debt and many companies view people fairly or not as replaceable given some of these factors there are many other factors the point is that demand sits where the studios have enough control to dictate the market for it to remain at these conditions just to give you an idea i faced similar in game development and while my skills are still in demand and always were i doubled my salary as soon as i left the industry while halving my stress level you only take these kinds of jobs if you love what you do and really want to do otherwise you wont last or you leave and someone else takes your place for a tiny salary
anime,not_removed,how much would this increase the cost of making a or episode anime it would increase it enough that there would be very little anime being created they arent paid enough because there literally just isnt enough money to go around
anime,not_removed,reference for the discussion httpimgurcomadpmog
anime,not_removed,are you serious you think the studio is going to pay for a train pass have fun walking
anime,not_removed,thanks for your indepth response did you end up leaving the game development industry entirely for a new field were you able to jump into a higher paying job soon or did you have to go back to school
anime,not_removed,very helpful thanks
anime,not_removed,holy fcking shit hanakana must be filthy rich
anime,not_removed,holy shit i knew vas were big in japan but not that much
anime,not_removed,no problem hopefully someone more directly in the industry can provide a less generic firsthand response as mine boils down to the cruel financials of business regarding jumping into a higher paying job as i got older it seemed game development didnt have much of a future i was losing relationships and going through a lot of personal life hardships despite my career going well the woman i was with at the time gave me an ultimatum and i didnt really like that i moved on from her but i decided she was right at least i had no interest in jumping into an exec role or running my own game company as ive seen it go horribly wrong for too many people both financially and mentally and the idea of leaving was to regain some sanity and health i moved on to data science ai and performance optimization mainly though i do a lot of other work depending on who im working for and what they need at the moment since ive been in computing a long while you pickup a lot of everything if youre not lazy and having a graphics and programming background is very useful in ai and machine learning for one thing theres a big demand for people who know gpu programming ex ai and the innards of memory and cpu optimization so theres a lot of different areas that i can jump into unfortunately animators have a lot less luxury though if youre good at it you will still at least stay employed somewhere once youre in i do take games consulting work mainly in performance if im not working fulltime or if it is for a friend but only sparingly i work a bit on my own games but dont find much time and motivation anymore so nothing real gets done
anime,not_removed,well the popular ones like hollywood stars there are c listers to every fukuyama and wakamoto
anime,not_removed,sakurasou is like kawaiisou
anime,not_removed,alright here are my recommendations theyre based on your likings as i can see a pattern of high school life funny interactions between a close group of friends mixed in with lighthearted romance takes place in college but with pretty much the same setting as kawai complex a group of friends live together with dynamic interactions and romance is a good pick as it also revolves around a group of friends with funny interactions highschool life and romance though the drama aspect is a bit heavy at times comedy slice of life with a nice touch of romance the show also revolves around a group of friends and college life group of friends live together sol comedy and romance other shows you might like
anime,not_removed,try watching hyouka slice of life mysteries that deal with things you wouldnt think of in real life

anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,you can see traces of the sex hair
anime,not_removed,i wonder why youd say that rinkek
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomruunpfejpg
anime,not_removed,this one screams amagami
anime,not_removed,can death note kill servants
anime,not_removed,that reminds me you really should get around to watching fsn ubw i think youll appreciate the final episode
anime,not_removed,definitely let me know if theres a repeat which ones were they ill be going through the album again a bit later if i have time so i might get to them
anime,not_removed,other girl
anime,not_removed,great things are best enjoyed in small quantities mate just wait till like and we should have enough
anime,not_removed,i have weird taste eg i like monkeys better than crabs and cats so fgo marie antoinette album when
anime,not_removed,easy mistake to make but that is not the real saten ruiko
anime,not_removed,no but im pretty sure you can accelerate them into outer space
anime,not_removed,when i finally finished my collection i found duplicates on the fate folder i even had copies of the same image so still very good job
anime,not_removed,aw man i really dont want to go back through xd but one was in the first half and i think the second was in the second half sorry thats not really useful i know if i get really bored tonight maybe ill check it out
anime,not_removed,that weird blonde one with the sword
anime,not_removed,hopefully when the move gets released in there will be more people on the sakura hype train just gotta bide my time until then
anime,not_removed,i like monkeys better than crabs and cats sooooo you like kanbaru better than hitagj and hanakawa
anime,not_removed,no its a reference to the meme of referring to with sex hair
anime,not_removed,how the fuck did you do this you didnt check it one by one did you
anime,not_removed,thumbsup thanks this will be very helpful
anime,not_removed,its fine the dude above us gave me the of every single duplicate in the album
anime,not_removed,tearsofabestgirl
anime,not_removed,best girl
anime,not_removed,the great thing about best waifu is that she will s wait for us forever
anime,not_removed,im a dumb scrub whats this sex hair meme you speak of
anime,not_removed,obviously used a program i wouldve lost my sanity if i had to manually find duplicates by searching through the folders still had lots of work to do though since i had to go through over sets of duplicates and check the image previews because some would be similar when its actually a completely different image
anime,not_removed,no problem glad i could help i thought that i searched for duplicates on saber album instead by accident though when i read
anime,not_removed,thats dedication lulz
anime,not_removed,taigasigh
anime,not_removed,schemingsaten misakaheh
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,jokes on you s saber waited forever too but she got the guy while sakura waited for nothing shes basically the reason hes dead gg sakura best waifu got rewarded while worms is forever alone well in that end anyway
anime,not_removed,youre not wrong but i was hoping to not have my heart broken on redditcom
anime,not_removed,what program is that i use visipics but that looks nicer
anime,not_removed,you do what you need to do if its best girl yuishrug
anime,not_removed,you must hate my saber mega album then trollarcher
anime,not_removed,ouch if youre going to push the knife in that deep you may as well just finish the job s like shirou did to saber
anime,not_removed,i appreciate your work i just think saber isnt all that amazing shes cool though
anime,not_removed,sparks linear high is the better ending confirmed granted im one of those people whos of the mind that rin had it right in hf s should have just killed sakura
anime,not_removed,s that would not have been good for rin imo her character arc consists of her struggling between being the kind person she actually is vs being a cold blooded magus like her father she made the right choice in keeping her human side stronger plus its like the only significant development to her character that we get
anime,not_removed,s im not so sure thats right for anyone though killing sakura gives you probably the most interesting bad end of the series i must admit but it also contradicts shirous ideal does it not kirei even points out that hes certain emiya shirou will last until the end because now hes just like emiya kiritsugu shirou is in a situation where its betray his ideal and have nothing or betray it and have something of course hes gonna choose the something no
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,could be this one
anime,not_removed,unfortunately its not thanks anyways though
anime,not_removed,its not this one either i dont think it had anyone standing in front of a camera only clips of shows thank you though
anime,not_removed,is a decently old song thats quite popular and has been in quite a lot of anime i like the nichijou version because the town visuals work quite well with the tone of the song
anime,not_removed,also from inuyasha god did that anime have great music
anime,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuqjcfvanwjq
anime,not_removed,angel night from city hunter its a pretty cool op
anime,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdehmpokrtrc from yu yu hakusho
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,is one i spent years without listening until my recent rewatch of it
anime,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgtynhmlqnqk i dont remember anything about the anime except the theme
anime,not_removed,does simple and clean count if not then from eureka seven i have it on my phone but i just havent listened to it in a while that scene when the song plays is one of my top ten favourite anime scenes of all time higher than the sun
anime,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdioilnkrhu
anime,not_removed,and httpssoundcloudcomhumbertochalatechobitsletmebewithyou from a personal favorite of mine chobits
anime,not_removed,sadly no one remember silent mobius anymore
anime,not_removed,the slayers had httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyjaiygmvruc
anime,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchveszskveday
anime,not_removed,akatsuki no kuruma from gundam seed is still one of my favourite songs
anime,not_removed,i really like larc en ciel what can i say
anime,not_removed,tooisora from gundam war in the pocket definitely one of my top all time favorite
anime,not_removed,as a longtime masami okui fan i remember when she did both themes for the tales of eternia anime during the height of her fame like most video game adaptions it wasnt stellar but her songs were great tales of eternia op tales of eternia ed she went on to write many other great anime songs and now hosts the annual animelo concerts in japan every august to me masami okui and chihiro yonekura are hidden gems from the anime scene a bit of chihiro yonekura while im at it mon colle knights op houshin engi ed edit star ocean ex had an and a onehit wonder as its which i also listened to a lot back then
anime,not_removed,look for utada hikaru her songs old or new are awesome its she singing the endings from the rebuilds of evangelion and
anime,not_removed,im more of a fan of httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlcfyrxxhbe because the singers sound like children i get chills everytime the choir comes in the chorus
anime,not_removed,do as infinity is such a good band
anime,not_removed,that last song for some reason it sounds better in soundcloud than youtube or other places it appears to be tv version but idk why it still sounds better than other sites
anime,not_removed,have you seen star driver before seems to be one of those series that fell into obscurity after it was done for good reason it was a bit of a mess but the music and the insert songs were pretty great especially monochrome
anime,not_removed,i havent but it looks cute with all the animes i watched found from songs i could see myself watching star driver
anime,not_removed,well monster musume certainly does help me in certain ways ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
anime,not_removed,to be fair my life would probably be a lot better if there were more sexy monster girls in it
anime,not_removed,as in get yourself some help
anime,not_removed,also machiavellis the prince in business books thats kind of hilarious also also i dont think the willpower instinct sounds very medical
anime,not_removed,i assume is a guide to avoid being killed by living with different types of monster girls

anime,not_removed,one piece bros unite
anime,not_removed,that is high but only shared anime
anime,not_removed,uh we both like gave one punch man a idk ¯ツ ¯
anime,not_removed,im looking for more friends i probably posted too late though and im also too lazy to go through the profiles because im on mobile
anime,not_removed,uhh no thank you
anime,not_removed,well hello then also anyone giving nge a is an automatic friend in my book
anime,not_removed,sure
anime,not_removed,its about to get higher just added a bunch of stuff from your watched list to my plan to watch
anime,not_removed,we seem to have a lot of show in common ive gotta know though whats the justification behind giving sao a
anime,not_removed,its one of the best ive seen in terms of quantityaffinity ratio our taste is pretty similar as well always good to see mushishi appreciation that show is fantastic
anime,not_removed,o i think my highest before this was like a
anime,not_removed,never knew you have a reddit ac
anime,not_removed,everyone is entitled to their own opinion that being said i dont think anything deserves a
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,ttgl a and baccano a accepted excellent taste helmetbro
anime,not_removed,hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
anime,not_removed,woo friend also haikyuu season hype
anime,not_removed,yeah i dunno oh well
anime,not_removed,that ones actually a contract i just got lucky between rezero and ks i am thinking about him more than usual though and thats even with the fact that hes uh nowhere near a bishounen in either easily among the best parts of both shows anyway
anime,not_removed,httpsmyanimelistnetprofileptjohe although i havent watched most of your list im afraid but those are the ones that count
anime,not_removed,i had the mobile site on so i didnt see that though ive seen people have a lot lower affinity with me so comparatively this isnt that bad
anime,not_removed,will take forever if you never do it p just copy a few shows everyday thats what i did with mine
anime,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomeuphoricdecenthapuku
anime,not_removed,httpsmyanimelistnetprofilekinginthenorthy
anime,not_removed,watch it while grinding
anime,not_removed,glad to hear it lucky you though you dont have to wait through years of filler haha
anime,not_removed,konosuba diapt and aswell youre just a way harsher rater than i am d
anime,not_removed,it was the reason i even got into anime it deserves this score for making me go into the anime world and watch all the things that i would have never known about
anime,not_removed,oh god i just realized were born the same year and month and live in the same city lmfao
anime,not_removed,yea if were getting strict on the scores nothing deserves a idk if anything in the world is absolutely perfect in every single way
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,fistbump
anime,not_removed,he doesnt play a bishounen in the twelve kingdoms either hes sort of a mentor
anime,not_removed,yeah theres no love interest in the twelve kingdom you still have saiunkoku to watch if you want or theres also fushigi yuugi both within the same genres ha i failed at replying lol
anime,not_removed,sounds about right glad to have made another friend
anime,not_removed,if i were to do a day thatd take half a year
anime,not_removed,ill be checking out casshern sins hibike to see if we really do have similar tastes
anime,not_removed,at a certain point the magic just disappeared for me eh i still enjoy a few anime every season just have to know what to pick and what to drop
anime,not_removed,fair enough yea i accredit steinsgate for the exact same thing so i definitely get the rationale
anime,not_removed,same month and everything weird well if that doesnt justify a friend request im not sure what does
anime,not_removed,um but i know youelitist of mal forums
anime,not_removed,well shit off to one of the reverse harems then
anime,not_removed,yeah theres no love interest in the twelve kingdom ok now this is back on the priority list yes my posts do make sense shut up i thought there were more on that list hanasakeru seishounen ouran but it looks like his roles are more minor in those damn
anime,not_removed,i also rate anime i liked really high p you guys seem to have kinda simular tastes as i do plus youve both seen monster musume so ill send you two a friend request
anime,not_removed,accepted it
anime,not_removed,woah ill look into it

anime,not_removed,yeah it would be cool to do a weekly stream or something
anime,not_removed,i was just thinking about rewatching the anime and rereading the manga
anime,not_removed,cant do daily threads myself but im so down for this rewatch
anime,not_removed,it would be fun to give the series a shot seeing as i loved hxh if it gets off the ground id participate
anime,not_removed,i was planning to watch the series after i finish gintama and that isnt happening anytime soon unfortunately a rewatch will be fundamental to start inge the series sooner
anime,not_removed,its been on my plan to watch for a while and id like to see it but i prefer watching one show at a time and right now im about episodes into hajime no ippo if i finish in time ill join in and even if i dont ill catch up to you guys eventually assuming youre only doing an episode or two a day
anime,not_removed,ive already committed to an urusei yatsura rewatch so this may not be possible for me but its a good idea
anime,not_removed,i havent seen it before but thought about trying it so id be happy to follow along with some discussion
anime,not_removed,theres actually a yyh rewatch already in progress over at ryuyuhakusho its already to episode by now though
anime,not_removed,hey man ive watched episodes since i commented this so its not looking too far away any more
anime,not_removed,wait what i thought there was the episode series a episode sequel and then another episode sequel so episodes in total and im episodes in to go
anime,not_removed,rejoice edit rip it airs at where i live
anime,not_removed,as a lover of the main series this is the anime that hypes me the most together with hibike for the new season i really hope that its as fun to watch
anime,not_removed,nice more working on cr
anime,not_removed,inamisan is that u
anime,not_removed,finally
anime,not_removed,whats the tld
anime,not_removed,good shit right here glad services like crunchyroll are still around
anime,not_removed,yamada guy too
anime,not_removed,yeah takes place in another wagnaria branch
anime,not_removed,havent read the source so dont really know what to expect still its from the same team so my hopes are pretty high for this one
anime,not_removed,wasnt that the point of the show the characters not the plot
anime,not_removed,this submission has been removed merchandise posts belong in the weekly merch mondays megathread found have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,yep its a sequel
anime,not_removed,sequel to the original show the movies are essentially a remake of the anime you can watch either the anime or the movies before watching the new one the movies are slightly more faithful with the added character that wasnt on the original anime but is important to the plot to the manga so if your in a rush to watch the new ones watch the movies i personally like the anime
anime,not_removed,this submission has been removed threads consisting of a direct question may be removed once a proper answer has been provided this is not a violation of subreddit rules its subreddit cleanup have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,you shouldnt have big expectations of this sequel being that good
anime,not_removed,berserk has better character development and isnt rushed it also doesnt have bad cgi in it if you care about that its probably best to watch the series then the movie before starting on the next season
anime,not_removed,why not it may have bad cgi but that doesnt mean it will suck its likely going to be one of the better shows in the season
anime,not_removed,i told u
anime,not_removed,bananya wat
anime,not_removed,is anyone else prepared to be confused by the fact that both relife and rewrite are coming out in the same season and both are fairly hyped
anime,not_removed,orange looks the most promising to me im really looking forward to it
anime,not_removed,said this last time but seriously theres a soccer anime a baseball anime an allmale cheerleader anime and an anime about a guy who watches all of these so he can ship the guys together this is gonna be a goooood summer season for me
anime,not_removed,d a n g a n r o n p a
anime,not_removed,r e i h y p e
anime,not_removed,love live sunshine hype
anime,not_removed,orange relife and time travel shoujo so much time traveling i do love my time travel though also masou gakuen hxh these school battle harem premises are getting weirder and weirder
anime,not_removed,baseball anime at last my thirst is somewhat quenched
anime,not_removed,i will be watching shokugeki ive been keeping up with the manga so im super hyped to see the tournament arc animated berserk at long last it returns not sure about the cgi but ill still watch relife started reading the manga a while back and its become one of my favorites dangan ronpa the twoseries format is interesting and the animeoriginal story should ensure that the plot isnt too rushed like its predecessor ill definitely be watching handakun i will gladly take an extra helping of barakamon from what ive heard about the manga handas school days are even better than his time on the island shows i might consider mob psycho orange amanchu
anime,not_removed,time to double down on d gray man greatness and complete it before hallow comes out allen is a fucking legend im predicting hallow to be my personal anime of the year also love potion and iroha date ovas are lit as fuck its gonna be a great season
anime,not_removed,im a bit hyped about watching love live sunshine as it will be my first true idol show if everything goes okay i will be watching around shows next season counting leftovers from this one
anime,not_removed,berserk about time we get out of the golden age arc i guess thats the animes own little boat taboo tattoo martial arts huh im pretty interested days a prohibition era show im definitely looking forward to this bananya next seasons aotsaoty meme majestic hour never saw the original but it looks good mob psycho made by the same guy that made opm sounds good danganronpa the two series thing is interesting i do hope that this is a nice end to the hopes peak story orange i enjoyed the manga a lot so im excited to see it as an anime
anime,not_removed,we got a banana cat anime and a talking fart anime well summer best season confirmed seriously though a lot of exciting shows i want to watch cant wait for season
anime,not_removed,skipping out on most of the action series until other people begin judging them i think other stuff that seems interesting to me berserk though im guessing i should watch the original series first bproject idol manager sure why not show by rock short i liked the first season well enough taboo tattoo warping spacetime sounds kinda fun kono bijutsubu ni wa mondai ga aru high comedic potential but could fall flat days original drama involving the mafia im on board relife been hearing hype for this one and it has a romance tag handakun ill miss naru but hey barakamon was pretty good tsukiuta idols based on months again why not rewrite key vn ill give it a shot orange read the manga and really liked it so hoping the anime can hold up
anime,not_removed,what is banaya supposed to be about and talking farts who in the hell is going to watch onara garou really
anime,not_removed,i still cant believe d gray man is getting another anime i feel like im back in junior high top most anticipated planetarian absolutely loved the visual novel when i read it a couple years back and hoping this will be a great alternative way to experience the story shokugeki first season turned out to be a surprise favorite of the season but top ten of for me super excited for more days always been a sucker for these types of revenge stories and the prohibition era one of my most favorite times in history makes me even more interested danganronpa more danganronpa is always a good thing in my book im hoping for a good conclusion to the hopes peak academy story relife im absolutely in love with the manga and have been waiting anxiously for this adaption to finally start everything else battery d gray man mob psycho rewrite orange
anime,not_removed,will be aots a relaxing show from the creator of about girls scubadiving with pseudoyuri themes h y p e y p e nbsp has been awaited for long too and could also be aots but many dislike the idea of cg
anime,not_removed,berserk fatekaleid prisma illya shokugeki no soma love live sunshine this season is going to be awesome
anime,not_removed,damn this season is stacked there is like shows i want to check out slightoverreaction
anime,not_removed,i guess its time to actually decide what to watch shokugeki no souma because i loved the first season berserk ill probably watch the whole thing even if it turns out to be terrible relife the mangas been pretty hyped up for a while so im looking forward to it orange same with this one rewrite just because its key hopefully you dont have to play the vn to understand whats going on arslan senki the first season was pretty good and i need my fix of realistic historical fantasy mob psycho because bones the author of one punch man sounds cool and the is shitnuts insane days an animeoriginal about mafia during prohibitionera america yes please fatekaleid liner prisma illya dont judge me amaama to inazuma because im confident it will be the cutest thing ever active raid first season was pretty cool planetarian again because key amanchu from the author of aria so we should have some nice iyashikei taboo tattoo is on the maybe list along with tales of vestiria nejimaki seirei senki qualidea code new game and regalia shows is a pretty good number next season should be pretty great
anime,not_removed,i was waiting for somebody to post these because i often forget whats coming up next season looking good also that kizu bd is so close
anime,not_removed,im so hyped for handakun and sweetness and lightning summer season is pretty much sol heaven also cant wait for dgrayman
anime,not_removed,i dont care about anything else in that list except berserk
anime,not_removed,strangely enough im not that hyped for this coming season lets see what really intrigues me by this lists order fudanshi koukou seikatsu say what fudanshi gay friend what a time to be alive i seriously hope it wont just be hah gayyyyyyyyyyy but have some substance to it we talk a lot about fujoshi but not fudanshi could be really interesting amanchu ive heard good things about the manga and iirc its made by arias author too while i dont really remember much about aria i do remember liking it quite a bit watching theone of the trailers was enough to buy my hype days prohibition era revenge mafia original story and drama do i have anything else to say battery the imagine used looks pretty the tags are good it will also be my first baseball anime orange didnt notice it when i first looked at the list but i read someones comment who said it was the only anime that looked interesting to them went back to it and i have to admit it does sound like the most promising anime for summer that is not also a sequel anime only really getting my attention seems fairly low the rest really sound shitoverdoneaverage i did not include berserk because i kind of dont want to watch and keep my innocence for the manga which will not include cgi as for things ill be watching mostly because theyre sequels and probably like because theyre right up my alleybecause i have shit tastebecause i heard good things about the source material love live sunshine well what can i say while i could shit endlessly on idols i love cute girls and waifu wars and feeling good love live provided the right amount of pandering to make me love it so why not give its pseudosequel a shot taboo tatoo the image looks pretty the tags scare me though average at best it seems kono bijutsubu ni wa mondai ga aru a kind of gjbu in an art club i dunno girls look cute and comedy might be there to carry it planetarian key then again i kinda want to preserve my innocence for the vn handakun loved barakamon could be interesting to see more of handa though i feel like the lack of naru and quest for self might bring it down a bit compared to the main story shokugeki no sôma well loved the first season no reason to not watch the second season relife heard good things about the manga and the concept sounds quite interesting i hope it wont just devolve into a lets take it as a chance to fuck those hot teenagers though i feel like it wont be the case new game cute girls doing cute things dôga kôbo my jam usually rewrite because key but again just like for berserk and planetarian i would prefer to experience the source material first nanatsu no taizai liked the first season more of it wont hurt the rest is just there and will have to gain my trust kyoani and their violet evergarden cant come soon enough
anime,not_removed,active raid season fuck yeah other than that im quite hyped for amanchu amaama new game and locodol ova
anime,not_removed,hope that tenkyou no alderamin is good the manga is a actually pretty interesting read
anime,not_removed,will i need to read rewrite before watching it or not enough info the way the summery goes it seems like i should read the vn
anime,not_removed,really looking forward to dgray man it has been a long time a decade since the last anime
anime,not_removed,i think mob psycho will surprise a lot of people and make a strong case for aots a new makoto shinkai movie cool sign me up
anime,not_removed,mob psycho the hype is too real
anime,not_removed,onara garou is about farts whelp this show is going to be nothing but memes
anime,not_removed,still salty that theres no psycho pass
anime,not_removed,oh god theres so much i wanna check out is gonna be hilarious ive read a bit of the manga and the shenanigans are bizarre barakamon was pretty funny and now getting a show completely dedicated to that humor is gonna be great is adorable and funny the little romance is nice and theres a great cast as well as someone caught up with the manga im pretty excited looks badass dont know much about this one but looking forward to it is a great manga with great characters pretty funny too and the premise is cool i think is gonna be the emotional ride of the season interesting premise too might probably be a sub favorite of the season hype so much hype and so many other shows like rewrite battery days new game mob psycho amanchu etc etc but i dont wanna write that much edit too im pretty stoked for this movie
anime,not_removed,i hope turns out to be good i would love to see a hype footballsoccer anime
anime,not_removed,i know its not really anime but kingsglaive is the thing im most excited for and seeing it on this list gets me hyped also kizu part
anime,not_removed,drifters hype
anime,not_removed,orezoku ova yesssssssssssssssss more iroha
anime,not_removed,watching shokugeki arslan sequel mob psycho will probably watch tales of zestria love live sunshine days new game will wait to hear what people say about them relife planaterian rewrite orange masou gakuen hxh alderamin on the sky
anime,not_removed,only came to mind because i watched a digi video today but despite the amount complaints i see about there being too many ln adaptations nowadays the new season has all of if the list is to trusted
anime,not_removed,honestly im probably looking forward to one piece film gold the most
anime,not_removed,upcoming konosuba ova featuring yunyun whom the ln readers cant seem to stop talking about nice
anime,not_removed,everyone planning on watching the new danganronpa series keep in mind that they are a direct sequel and prequel respectively to the second game which has not received an anime adaptation
anime,not_removed,the fujoshi in me is getting so excited for fundashi koukou seikatsu will relate bl fans unite
anime,not_removed,new berserk thats all i needed to know
anime,not_removed,my ptw list for this season basically everything
anime,not_removed,man i was hoping this season would look really shitty so id have time to catch up on all the stuff i didnt have time to watch this season but as of right now im interested in d grayman fukigen no mononokean days arslan food wars battery tales of zestiria relife fudanshi mob psycho cute hugh earth defense club if i finish season in time orange cheer danshi though tbh i dont really expect to continue cheer danshi tales of zestiria since ive yet to enjoy a video game adaptation or an ufotable show but ive gotta try anyway cuz they always look so pretty or fukigen for various dumb reasons i wanna try them sigh im never gonna catch up with jojo
anime,not_removed,goodgood show me your key power let vn flow through you needless to say i excited to see how badly they mangle especially rewrite sources still fingers crossed hoping for the best i definitely will try days setting is attracting methe same is for anything with youkai they are always welcome in my bookso mononokean please dont suck
anime,not_removed,i plan to watch relife rewrite orange new game amaama to inazuma days planetarian taboo tattoo amanchu kono bijutsubu any others anyone has knowledge of that i should add to this list im mostly just basing it off the descriptions and genres as i dont have a lot of source material under my belt
anime,not_removed,i have no clue what to watch other than shokugeki i havnt seen berserk or d gray yet man so i cant watch those lol
anime,not_removed,maybe bproject will fill that void left behind by sekkou boys
anime,not_removed,either my tolerance for shit is expanding or seasons are getting better but either way it seems like ill be checking out quite a few shows once again
anime,not_removed,cant wait for planetarian
anime,not_removed,there is only one i need to know of and ive waited years for it berserk is back
anime,not_removed,looks for horror sees two well i suppose that aint too bad especially since theres berserk
anime,not_removed,at this rate the berserk anime will finish the series before the manga does
anime,not_removed,food wars and of course rezero
anime,not_removed,no one seems to have commented it yet but volume of oregairu will have an ova d
anime,not_removed,im not the only one excited for tales of zestiria right when i saw it was by ufotable my excitement doubled
anime,not_removed,deleted
anime,not_removed,my hype level for berserk cannot be described anyone know how far theyll animate it im really hoping to get to the armor arc but i somehow doubt that it will get that far also to finally see schierke
anime,not_removed,neregate anime chart summer lots of good anime coming out per usual relife amaama new game amanchu orange rewrite days and many many more should be very fun to follow in a months time
anime,not_removed,that berserk description would be ok for the film or even the series but this is set after those events why is it like that
anime,not_removed,yep i knew it seasons gonna suck now that okusama is about to make fall blow this trash right out of the water i kid heres what imma start with orange relife rewrite probably mob psycho probably the time travel thing hopefully kimi no na wa pretty colors to the max boi
anime,not_removed,cant wait to see more berserk to be animated mixed feelings with the cgi but the team thats doing it seems really passionate about it which gives me hope
anime,not_removed,i really hope danganronpa wouldnt be bad like the last one summer season sequel season
anime,not_removed,mother of godshokugeki berserk d gray man fate active raid and relife all in the same month heaven forbid i actually try some of the others too i will be glued to my computer
anime,not_removed,as usual i watching like half of the shows in the season but these are the ones im looking forward to the most berserk illya days arslan senki d gray man hallow orange amanchu also that episode of majestic prince summer is looking so good
anime,not_removed,damn jc staff is on fire this summer
anime,not_removed,for those who havent read the vn be hyped for rewrite
anime,not_removed,am i the only one who is hyped about onara gorou everyday life of a fart wtf
anime,not_removed,whooo so many sports anime
anime,not_removed,til what a fundashi is
anime,not_removed,its weird for a summer season to have less hype than the season before ive hopes for taboo tattoo great manga and fudanshi koukou because gay above all days have the most interesting premise i belive and danganronpa
anime,not_removed,a question about berserk where should i start
anime,not_removed,days because a mafia based anime sounds awesome fundanshi koukou seikatsu because i like bl handakun it just looks like itll be funny orange because of its hype and i generally like time travel relife a guy redoing his teen years after his life sucked seems like it could be good depending on its writing tales of zesteria since the tales anime are usually decent i might check out a few others
anime,not_removed,my summer watching shall be as follows sequel hypuu shokugeki no souma arslan senki premise has me intrigued battery relife orange days candidly jumping in taboo tattoo days new game rewrite kono bijutsubu ni wa mondai ga aru bproject nanatsu no taizai probably a filler arc should probably try and get through the originals first handakun berserk studio gets me to put aside my inhibitions tales of zestria the x amanchu nejimaki seirei mob psycho nbsp so shows to start with probably have that below by week and at a comfy shows by week
anime,not_removed,season is stacked with so many shows i want to watch plus leftovers like macross delta and jojo summer is going to be great fun
anime,not_removed,im watching about this season looks like its going to be increased to this season so hyped for shokugeki
anime,not_removed,active raid gets second season humm must have seel good enough i guess because i found it bad like really bad
anime,not_removed,so what are the shows to look out for here besides shokugeki season
anime,not_removed,excited for saiki
anime,not_removed,lets gooo amaama to inazuma i fucking love these slice of life anime where there is a parentkid dynamic
anime,not_removed,did everyone miss the fact that david productions is doing something other than jojos or is it just me plus on top of that its planetarian
anime,not_removed,summer is eh but shokugeki will make my summer
anime,not_removed,oh god the hype for dgrayman and danganronpa is just killing me i cant wait
anime,not_removed,why has nobody mentioned onara gorou just read that fucking premise im laughing already
anime,not_removed,ehh very underwhelming for me i usually go into shows a season and there are only that interest me here
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,been looking forward to this season for a while got a relatively decent amount i plan to follow hopefully fall will be as good though im excited for flip flappers that looks like itll be a sakugafest if the pv is any indication
anime,not_removed,im not sure of what to think about qualidea code on one hand i want to believe because i love watari wataru to death but on the other it sounds really awful
anime,not_removed,arslan hype if they have more epic sword fights like in the last couple of episodes my body may not be ready
anime,not_removed,need that nejimaki seirei senki adaptation so much
anime,not_removed,orange seems like it could be one hell of a ride ive been looking forward to relife for a while now so much that ive reread the series at least twice time travel shoujo is one ive heard nothing about but it has two of my favorite things time travel and girls so i think i might like it amanchu will probably be my moeblob for the season days coming out of left field and would probably win all of my hype except nanatsu no taizai is getting a second season im so excited

anime,not_removed,best season of anime ive seen in quite a while for me personally so many shows to be hyped for
anime,not_removed,could anyone tell me if i need to be familiar with the games to enjoy this tale of zestiria i watched an ova that was realesed some time ago and the lore interested me
anime,not_removed,didnt know the second season of nanatsu no taizai comes out next season awesome
anime,not_removed,servamp is so good q
anime,not_removed,my ptw list kingsglaive days under the dog shoukugeki no soma orange active raid
anime,not_removed,summer is looking pretty tits
anime,not_removed,battery looks promising havent watched a sports anime in a while
anime,not_removed,so far im watching orange looks like what i wanted steins gate to be shokugeki no soma mob psycho relife rewrite amanchu maybe days taboo tattoo deadly sins havent decided if ill drop season
anime,not_removed,hope that the english bluray of kimi no na wa will be released within a reasonable time
anime,not_removed,kimi no na wa is it related to shigatsu in any way
anime,not_removed,love live sunshine
anime,not_removed,seven deadly sins is all the way until august whyyyyyy
anime,not_removed,mob psycho looks interesting mainly because its by the same guy who wrote one punch man aside from that im looking forward to shokugeki season and tales of zesteria
anime,not_removed,is berserk a remake of the original or is it like a second season i havent seen the one that is already out but was interested in watching it
anime,not_removed,what should i watch im more of a kobosuba dxd type watcher ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
anime,not_removed,welp you know youre a key fanboy when you come expecting lots of hype for rewrite and no ones mentioning it haha that said these are what stood out for me taboo tattoo berserk love live hatsukoi monster fatekaleid konobiju amanchu planetarian days battery handakun relife amaama to inazuma new game rewrite danganronpa orange
anime,not_removed,i think my track record for detecting good shows off of just this list has been pretty good though i suspect this season will have more hidden gems than expected good shows this current season is definitely above average in terms of general show quality and im hoping the summer will keep this momentum of good shows going so my tentative list with shorts thoughts days something like joker game monster interesting setting and looks like it has a very coherent plot it will follow might scratch that dramatic plotline itch battery kind of dislike these protagonists who have fallen getting back up again stories because of the amount of selfpity involved but depending on how it plays out might end up being an inspiring show with some good old baseball seems like a more dramatic take of oofuri handakun looks like a good show to watch after some of the heavy shows like days and arslan interesting premise but as with all comedy can be a hit or miss arslan senki i watched season and want to watch season thats it dgrayman i almost finished season and want to watch season thats it orange might be a hidden gem while timetravel time manipulating stories are starting to become trite i can always appreciate some good old high school drama with hopefully a good plot might end up being like kiznaiver so far hit or miss really relife read the webcomic hyped amanchu most surprising tag on this show is the shonen one but it might end up being a mislabel or misinterpretation its jc with slice of life so its promising already but the shonen tag is something that definitely piqued my interest mob psycho just a hunch really sounds too simple for it to be good but that couldve been said for one punch man rewrite jun maeda get ready for a wild ride edit not mazda still wild ride i usually confirm my suspicions with the pvs so once i see them ill update my guesses for good shows
anime,not_removed,berserk dgrayman tales of zestria planetarian arslan senki danganronpa accel world oh my god i will dieeeeeeeee
anime,not_removed,its great season for key fans both rewrite and planetarian getting anime adaptation i couldnt be more hyped i have to speed up with rewrite vn to end it before anime starts airing
anime,not_removed,will watch berserk its a classic and im hoping this sequel will be better than the original but lets see show by rock short i really liked first season so ill certainly watch this shokugeki no souma ni no sara second season of crazy food anime yup most certainly gonna watch dgrayman hallow i saw the original anime and it made me read the manga after so most certainly gonna watch this the maybes hatsukoi monster bproject kodou ambitious tales of zestiria the x saiki kusuo no man taboo tattoo fudanshi koukou seikatsu kono bitutsubu ni wa mondai ga aru planetarian chiisana hoshi no yume amanchu active raid handakun relife majestic hour ozmafia servamp tsukiuta the animation qualidea code nejimaki seirei senki regalia the three sacred stars ange vierge mob psycho new game rewrite masou gakuen hxh orange scared rider xechs i tend to try a lot of shows each season and often i end up dropping half and picking up shows that i didnt even think would be good i try to avoid slice of life because a lot of them have very little going for them and horror im just not into scaryfuckedupshitberserk gets the exception here because its a sequel to something ive previously watched
anime,not_removed,so is majestic hour a complete rebroadcast of majestic prince but with a different final episode then
anime,not_removed,ooh i like crime movies what do people think of days
anime,not_removed,onara goruonara goru the most admiral of farts i have to watch that
anime,not_removed,promising season from what i see must watch love live sunshine of course that will be the aots as selling sure and i will see as quality amanchu the manga is averagegood jc staff usually does very good adaptation in this genre show by rock shorts my short anime for the season and i loved show by rock relife the manga is awesome and i hope the adaptation will follow it and its in my favorite genres new game moe infusion moe infusion and i love it mob psyco if keeps the comedy as focus will be an awesome parody of superpowersanime give a chance hatsukoi monster read the manga and that will be a good romcom kono bijutsubu ni wa mondai ga aru seem a nice comedysol on an art club so seems good fudashi koukou seitaksu a set of weird characters in a solish style can be a good mix for comedy i will see amaama to inuzuma can be a fatherchildren good story i will try it rewrite my biggest problem with key adaptation are the dated art style a key adaptation with modern animation can hook me ovasonas locodol ova oh yes oh yes i love locodol and i hope yuri teasing will be max konosuba ova more konosuba is always good sansha sanyou im becoming fond of ss its one of the best sol of this season
anime,not_removed,is version usually the final version
anime,not_removed,kind of an underwhelming summer still a few worth checking out though inevitable ranime darling will be shokugeki no souma because ecchi
anime,not_removed,after last years rather lewd summer this one seems very tame im looking forward to shokugeki no souma arslan senki fatekaleid even though i still have to catch up on the previous season which i dropped half way trough because it was quite awful planetarian which i know nothing about but it looks really interesting and i will also be trying out but i know basically nothing about them new game berserk relife rewrite amanchu i think i have covered all the action that might interest me but are there any other interesting comedies or romances i should know about
anime,not_removed,mm
anime,not_removed,i cant wait for the whaaaat isssssss youuuuuuthhhh rewrite
anime,not_removed,im somewhat curious as to why the garo movie isnt on that list
anime,not_removed,so i gave literally no fucks about volleyball but haikyu changed that pretty damn fast not expecting that but is this soccer anime gonna even come close
anime,not_removed,planetarian rewrite second seasons of things people like adaptations of things im actually reading sorry guys this is clearly fake they went the extra mile by not putting hoshi no samidare on there to make it too obvious but they stacked too many good things in there for it to be real come back next week i dont know what to do when im actually excited for so many shows someone help me
anime,not_removed,im looking forward to berserk been waiting for this for awhile now im pretty excited the next thunderbolt ova should be worth watching second cour of will give me more to gush about and buy more figures of speaking of which not a fan of the look of the hg model lacks detail i feel i have noticed a zakuii with a bfg though in my recommendations i want a unicorn mode hg and a destroy mode hg as well currently have a cute little sd model that was in stock at my bookstore for cheap qualidea code is going to disappoint me but ill probably put myself through it because i hate myself because i just want to watch a generic shounen series that airs with no fanfare and for once have it be good bananya should be entertaining to send gifs of to friends shokugeki is exciting for me to have back cant wait for my roommate to ask how iron chef the anime is going like he does without fail every single time i watch an episode of it cant think of anything else to excite me heres to more jojos at least duwang is great so far
anime,not_removed,qualidea code is the magical school battle harem anime of this season i guess i know all of whats gonna happen but i may still watch for shits and giggles
anime,not_removed,mob psycho shokugeki no soma d gray man im so hyped maan
anime,not_removed,i counted about shows id watch at least the first episodes for probably about ill finish all the way through gonna be a fun summer
anime,not_removed,onara gorou wtf
anime,not_removed,what the hell an accel world movie how did i not know about this sooner very excited hope this is a sign for a season if it does well damn
anime,not_removed,plastic memories pls
anime,not_removed,well i am gonna watch berserk for sure and ill try out days and that show about the banana cat seems like a light season but i am sure theres gonna be some sleeper hits i will want to check out like this spring i didnt plan on watching flying witch and now its my second favorite show of the season
anime,not_removed,berserk
anime,not_removed,hmmm nothing on here that jumps right out at me except shokugeki the fudanshi show sounds odd if the comedy is nozakiesque i could see it working also the openly gay friend in the cast seems unusual for anime hatsukoi monster sounds painfully shoujo but i love that shit so maybe itll work its by deen which after last season at least merits my giving it a chance taboo tattoo sounds hype dont really care for action or martial arts but a show with that many bizarre tags could be amusing art school rejects sounds like a kind of lame premise but the concept of a guy surrounded by chicks trying to create his musewaifu amuses me planetarian is a super fucking big name vn ill keep the anime on radar in case it lives up to that pedigree but robots arent generally my thing the character designs for amanchu are adorable but it sounds like the show is about nothing i generally give sol shows a pass until i see whether they have sticking power i wanted to like flying witch but its just so boring days sounds cool hopefully it doesnt go full gangsta handakun will be on my radar relife is probably the most hyped show of the season the premise sounds pretty dumb but manga readers tout strong characterization as a selling point ill check it out ozmafia sounds hilariously improbable gonna check it out for fun onara goruo i what amaama to inazuma had me sold at single father with young daughter this sounds like a spiritual successor to usagi drop which was one of my favorite shows of all time will most likely be about nothing madhouse is making a show about teenaged military officers sounds pretty dumb but madhouse can make turds tapdance so who knows male cheerleaders sounds like a pretty gay topic hopefully in a good way brains base generally put out quality stuff every now and again i dont know anything about rewrite but key vns tend to fall somewhere on a scale of jesus fuck what is wrong with her eyes to oh shit who cut all these onions so ill wait for some feedback on this one before jumping in the show description for orange went from zero to sixty real fuckin quick will definitely check it out sounds like my kind of suffering sacred rider xechs sounds idiotic but reverse harems are few and far between so maybe worth tracking kizu when
anime,not_removed,thats so much content
anime,not_removed,saiki kusuo no sainan and mob psycho at the same time
anime,not_removed,do i need to watch older berserk to understand what is happening in the new one
anime,not_removed,new game is gonna be my aots i can feel it
anime,not_removed,masou gakuen hxh looks right up my alley leveling girls up via indecent acts you have my attention
anime,not_removed,days looks pretty good
anime,not_removed,saved this itll help for reference ive been told to check out beserk when i asked for more gritty animes similar to death note attack on titan and akame ga kill i hope its good edit deleted res issue fixed
anime,not_removed,hype arslan senki and shokugeki no soma fuck yea
anime,not_removed,shokugeki and relife hype
anime,not_removed,active raid does not deserve a second season
anime,not_removed,i think ill calm it on this season and only watch berserk and days look more into my long list of already aired shows to watch
anime,not_removed,even if it seems like a spinoff the lack of hype for more seven deadly sins content is disturbing that shit was fucking grand on another note im immensely hyped for more denka barakamon content and of course foodgasms the anime then theres tales of zestiria which at the very least seems interesting knowing ufotable the animation at least is bound to be some eye candy relife seems to be getting a bit of hype from reddit as well all in all im pretty excited for next season
anime,not_removed,i was not expecting to see taboo tattoo turned into an anime so hyped and please let the accel world movie do well so we can possibly get another season
anime,not_removed,got a psp emulator with the remake of digimon world one of the best games on running so ive fallenam falling quite behind this season so a lot of the titles i plan to watch next may be skipped whilst i finish this season going to watch fudanshi sounds like it could be really funny or fujoshidanshi fanservice hoping for the former ill give it a go at least days i like gangland stuff i hope it stays away from the gangsta territory of trying to mix in scifiyfantasy shit handakun barakamon prequel count me in shoukugeki no souma shoukugeki no souma sequel count me in amaama to inazuma this could be super moe it could also be fucking weird new game moe moe i love moe nanatsu no taizu seven deadly sins specialsequel count me in orange sounds interesting not gonna get too hype as some people have done time travel is easy to cock up for me lets see if they do it right undecided relife a uses a mcguffin to pretend to be a highschooler sounds interesting also sounds like the premise for a hentai if this has fanservicelove interests it may get a little weird onaro gouro
anime,not_removed,all else aside in the most hyped for the konosuba ova and aw infinite burst
anime,not_removed,so wait planetarian and rewrite at the same tie then also two different danganronpa arcspaths at the same time weird
anime,not_removed,im still not totally sure what to be looking forward to theres berserk thats easy even if im not sure how to feel about the animation side yet guess ive also already decided on shokugeki no souma and mob psycho im not sure about relife since im not big on sol but i was convinced to check out rewrite a little while back i dont know enough about any of the rest to really say im interested what am i missing shows isnt near enough to be following in a season
anime,not_removed,relife hype i really hope it turns out well and does the manga justice i recommend a episode watch because the concept itself is pretty fun
anime,not_removed,amaama to inazuma most adorable manga ever cant wait to see it animated
anime,not_removed,shit i forgot that i wanted to read the mononokean manga i have to get on that its on crunchyroll by the way
anime,not_removed,danganronpa yes
anime,not_removed,puzzle dragon konosubawot
anime,not_removed,mob psycho and berserk im happy thank you
anime,not_removed,yall are not nearly excited enough for new game cute as shit manga about girls at a game dev studio being adapted by the studio behind love lab yuri yuri german shoujo nozakikun and mikakunin de shinkoukei its going to be great
anime,not_removed,tales of zestiria anime
anime,not_removed,i guess its time for me to start shokugeki
anime,not_removed,watching for sure battery there is a huge hole in my heart after ace of diamond ended a few months ago days might watch days
anime,not_removed,days mib physcho and danganronpa are the ones im most hyped for
anime,not_removed,i guess ill watch danganronpa also the teen romantic comedy snafu short looks interesting big iroha fan other than that not much to look forward too tbh
anime,not_removed,d grey man fuck yes i am so hyped
anime,not_removed,mob psycho oh jesus yes
anime,not_removed,masou gakuken hxh so at first glance it looks like it is typical magic school battle ln guy shows up to school because imouto needs him runs into top rank girl while shes naked but then finds out he has the ability to level up girls by essentially fucking them boi
anime,not_removed,also there is a seemingly lack of moe i notice the sweetness and lightening show and ive read some of that manga it is super moe hopefully it is enough i guess this is what happens when you get a season jam packed with it you have to pay the price next season
anime,not_removed,uh this leaked kingsglaives release date i havent seen it announced anywhere else july
anime,not_removed,thank you for doing this i have never been one to watch anime during the season but i might just have to after seeing some of these
anime,not_removed,man there are like series i want to watch i dont even know what im going to do
anime,not_removed,relife and shokugeki hype will watch berserk once im done with the manga parts edit wtf qualidea code is on here too looks generic as fuck but apparently its written by watari so def gonna watch it anyway also mob psycho is gonna be hype as fuck in anime form
anime,not_removed,interesting hmmm maybe yo add that to the list no thanks ill watch the first season what the fuck is that onaro gorou the most lovable of farts i dont even what is why
anime,not_removed,i dont understand how shokugeki a cooking show has promo art with the character holding a knife wrong along the spine
anime,not_removed,i think i can speak for everyone when i say that bananya is the most anticipated anime this summer
anime,not_removed,orange having a suicidal character is a plus in my book days an original taking place during prohibition so much yes to this
anime,not_removed,what is the name of the last movie its missing the title and date
anime,not_removed,i am really excited for days these past years i have fallen in love with soccer and seeing mappa who made punchline my guilty pleasure anime i am excited to see what they can do with soccer i dont know much about the source material but i hope itll be something similar to baby steps in how its presented as well as character development days looks intriguing and shokugeki no soma is going to be a must watch for me there are a few other ones that i will give a chance also
anime,not_removed,holy hell berserk shokugeki relife rewrite arslan and orange all in one season gonna be insane to try and keep up for me also any predictions for which shows will come out of nowhere be surprise hits that are not the above or a sequel
anime,not_removed,seven deadly sins season two and orange whelp im not leaving the house this summer
anime,not_removed,cant wait for mob psycho been reading the manga for the last few weeks and i love it i really think the anime will be at least on par with opm anime only thing i wonder is what the anime will cover im thinking s hanazawa fight mid way through and claw branch at the end
anime,not_removed,berserk and mob psycho have me pretty hyped up to see but i was somehow distracted by that picture of masou gokuen hxh
anime,not_removed,mob psycho watching because of one punch man so tentatively hyped servamp watching because brains base but honestly i feel like this is gonna be a drop after a few episodes scared rider xechs watching because satelight but same as above feels like a drop tbh not a lot im excited about going into this maybe ill get to catch up on some other series
anime,not_removed,the description of relife hits a little too close to home to be comfortable watching it excited for cooking ecchi finding out why i remember liking d grayman seeing if berserk can work in and if one can get a great second show in mob psycho orange and days look interesting too
anime,not_removed,berserk orange relife im okay with this
anime,not_removed,ill be watching battery just because did the character designs predicting that either a the battery will become a couple by the end or b one of the two will develop feeling for the other but theyll be unrequited
anime,not_removed,where in the story is berserk picking up
anime,not_removed,so i guess that konosuba is gonna skip the s part in which kazuma switched parties completely looking forward to s yunyun though
anime,not_removed,all i really care about is berserk also cant wait for the next monogatari film
anime,not_removed,good to see that there are only a couple of potentially good things to watch i dont got a lot of time
anime,not_removed,general comments on this season wow this season is stacked with expectations and potential tons of blasts from the past like berserk dgrayman along with anticipated like arslan senki shokugeki and nanatsu no taizai throw in some other hyped shows like mob psycho and theres too much on the will watch for sure list already then you add in the shows some of those have a lot of potential itll be tough to actually watch half of those that end up being worth watching and then add the on top of that this season has too much to handle will watch for sure berserk a thousand megatons of hype i fully expect it to be shit so as not to have any expectations to disappoint will watch the full season for sure tales of zestiria hmm ufotable the intro episode a while back was pretty entertaining it will be super generic since its based on tales but still decent filler ill give it and probably watch the full thing arslan yey time to see what happens next will watch the full thing shokugeki no ohhhh shiiiiit this is happening watching relife premise sounds entertaining will probably watch the full season dgrayman hallow oh whats this neat i wonder how the art and animation will be compared to the original series ill watch this for sure mob psycho too much hype around this one will it deliver like opm possibly possibly not will watch for sure though dangan ronpa did i miss an animated somewhere i think ill watch this nanatsu no taizai ohh shiet the better of the shounen adventure shows returns this season will watch for sure the treatment saiki kusuo no nan shrug generic shounen supernatural with a whiff of edge ill give it eps taboo tattoo synopsis sounds like a generic supernatural action but the genre tag of comedy makes this show sound like a fullon shitfest ill have to see whether its the good kind of shitfest big order or the bad eps planetarian i didnt read the vn but iirc it was supposed to be decent drama scifi sounds good synopsis is slightly generic but shrug ill give it days humm could be interesting battery new sports anime to replace diamond it will still probably suck compared to major but ill still probably watch the whole thing maybe majestic hour eh generic mecha scifi rebroadcast i suppose ill give it the qualidea code edgy supernatural scifi premise at least action with hints of lord of the flies planetes could be great could be shit nejimaki seirei senki cant quite tell if its a harem or not regardless seems like one of the generic seasonal fantasy adventures days mmk more sports same comments as battery to provide a hook hatsukoi monster meh seems like a generic young shoujo romance ill give it kono bijutsubu ni wa mondai ga aru i want to not watch this at all because of the obnoxiously long title but the synopsis is vaguely mildly interesting ill give it amanchu so generic and im not a big fan of sol handakun meh seems like a generic comedy sol with a gimmicky premise will give it ozmafia im generally not a fan of child protags and artwork but the premise and tags are vaguely interesting enough ill give it to show what its got servamp better than twilight high suspicion of fujobait regalia the three sacred stars ok now this is one of the fanservice shows of the season but it looks like it will probably play things coy ill give it to see if its anything more ange vierge wixoss ripoff time will tell new game the cover looks horrific and the synopsis is mostly uninspired however the seinen tag will lead me to give it masuo gakuen hxh so i guess thats supposed to me hcups instead of ds yeah ok insert ecchi of the season i guess it could be a highschool dxd or an isuca ill give it to find out orange err so another timetravelish thing like bokumachi and relife meh i guess ill give it scared rider xechs missing a blondie with a mask i guess reverse harem scifi sol with romance ok seems like a shitfest maybe it will show me something interesting in future watch fatekaleid liner prisma i fully intend to watch this full series starting from the beginning someday maybe over this winter break pass for now love live i will eventually watch this full series in a few years when i have nothing better to do until then pixiv supplies me with all the maki i need ptw indefinite active oh this thing got a sequel are they merchandizing well or something looks like ill have to finish watching the first season then decide whether to pick this up or not rewrite will pass on this until after i read the vn which is on my planned todo sometime sometime oh hell no bproject reverse harem idol ugh not even once fudanshi koukou seikatsu oh hell no tsukiuta anthropomorphized months that are idols anthropomorphized month idols fuck this shit unlisted series generic nope
anime,not_removed,why does it say from june to august when there no shows starting in june
anime,not_removed,dangan ronpa
anime,not_removed,whats up with the big names for this years summer
anime,not_removed,so according to this poster the rewrite anime will focus on a path not available in the actual vn makes me somewhat more interested
anime,not_removed,little worried about some of the shows i plan on watching after checking that tms are making this seasonquite a lot i imagine the visuals for the shows will be heavily impacted due to them working on so many projects instead of focusing their efforts on or the shows are dgrayman orange amaama to inazuma bananya and relife
anime,not_removed,there we have it lads masou gakuen hxh is the harem of the season calling it now based on that godly summary
anime,not_removed,kind of barren im only interested in days and berzerk if word of mouth makes days sound interesting after or eps though i may jump on it
anime,not_removed,we got handakun and relife and days and orange that look interesting and heard a lot of mob psycho hype arslan senki finally ill have to explore this season for good anime tho since nothing really stands up for me
anime,not_removed,link is broken offline
anime,not_removed,ah yeaaaah arslan question would i need to watch the original berserk or can i just pick it up this summer and deep down i know i will probably watch masou gakuen hxh shamefully hopefully it has the over the top laughsstupidity ive come to expect from good ecchi like heavens lost property and monster musume edit didnt see the anime about soccer yes i may finally have a sports anime i like
anime,not_removed,looking forward to handakun mob psycho and the new deadly sins
anime,not_removed,first i thought this summer is shit but heylooks very great i hope active raid receive fair evaluations is underrated in mal
anime,not_removed,where were you when bananya saved anime
anime,not_removed,days sounds pretty interesting anime original oh hell yeah
anime,not_removed,looking forward to zestiria
anime,not_removed,do people not know about httpanichartnetsummer
anime,not_removed,amanchu anime hype
anime,not_removed,why hasnt anyone mentioned ketiai
anime,not_removed,is this berserk a continuation after the episode first season from the late or is it a reboot
anime,not_removed,not a huge amount this upcoming season that im interested in maybe beserk and love live ugh but i might just use this season to catch up on winterspring series
anime,not_removed,shokugeki no soma yes dgray man aww yes fudanshi something rather lets go saiki kusuo no psinan yis yis yis yis yis yis yis yis plus others such as orange but there is no way that i am going to keep up with all of the interesting stuff this season i could barely keep up with this past one
anime,not_removed,since neregate is down right now
anime,not_removed,they are animating planetarian oh boy the tears unless they change the ending i dont think i can stomach the depressing end again lol
anime,not_removed,planeterian is getting an anime holy fuck
anime,not_removed,thats nothing check out onara garou its a show about a fart
anime,not_removed,i didnt know i needed this until now
anime,not_removed,aoty right here
anime,not_removed,i tried researching bananya looks like there are multiple cats and they are stuck in bananas it looks like their front legs poke out of the bananas but their hindlegs are stuck i really want to see how they deal with this mobility issue moving forward will they come out of the bananas losing their essential quality of being cats stuck in bananas or will the show consist of bananas floating in space losing all of its sense of realism
anime,not_removed,wont rezero also still be airing
anime,not_removed,i cant wait for the rewatches
anime,not_removed,im prepared to be frustrated at people who are confused and post spoilers in the wrong threads and the bulk of are these related topics i remember ore monogatari and how every discussion thread theyd be a few people saying i havent seen this yet is it related to bakemonogatari instead of just googling
anime,not_removed,manga was a bitch to follow with the authors random ass hiatuses though waited so long between so many cliffhangers
anime,not_removed,my prediction is that orange is going to sweep this community after all of the love that shigatsu got im sure orange will be right up there after finishing the manga i wouldnt say i was in love with the whole thing but quality shoujos are rarely animated and its better than any shoujo ive seen animated
anime,not_removed,yes this the liveaction film was really good as well cant wait for the anime to start airing
anime,not_removed,yona of the dawn first
anime,not_removed,truly this is the summer for fujoshi and fudanshi
anime,not_removed,upupupupu
anime,not_removed,ive never been this excited to feel despair before in my life
anime,not_removed,the airing dates were today future arc miraihen starts on july and despair arc zetsubouhen starts airing on july hype
anime,not_removed,to people who only saw the first anime or who havent played the games please do yourself a favor and play or watch atleast the game both the first and the second game are on steam for a pretty cheap price of bucks the reason you should play atleast the game if you want to watch the anime is because even if they give a short background of the last couple of games you still wont be able to feel what these characters went through and how amazing the writing is
anime,not_removed,really hope to see s best girl chiaki animated atleast for a few seconds at the ending of the final episode really wanted to see s her i hope they give some love
anime,not_removed,cannot wait for this
anime,not_removed,do you have enough hype in stock
anime,not_removed,im going to be all caught up on the series just in time for pretty excited
anime,not_removed,should i bother with the last season or is it just loliyurifanservice
anime,not_removed,i havent been arrested yet so i guess ill risk another season
anime,not_removed,hype who needs plot when you have kuro o
anime,not_removed,still unsure if its called drei or brei
anime,not_removed,oh yes doki doki sunshine
anime,not_removed,i hope they do a gwar cover
anime,not_removed,i keep seeing hxh and getting exited
anime,not_removed,you mean better and better
anime,not_removed,deleted
anime,not_removed,glad to see a baseball anime but hoping for something along the lines of kuroko no basket of baseball a shounen comedy
anime,not_removed,studio mappa well thats gonna be worth checking out
anime,not_removed,didnt like arslan thats also due for summer and i completely forgot that
anime,not_removed,would i have to play any of the dangan ronpa games to understand ive only seem the first anime
anime,not_removed,from what ive heard about the manga handas school days are even better than his time on the island a huge part of the appeal for me in barakamon was the coziness of that island village life and handas development during it basically a perfect sol for me ill give this a shot but from the premise it seems like it wont be quite the same always hoping for a direct sequel though
anime,not_removed,wah theres gonna be a new berzerk series i saw that teaser a while back and assumed itd be for more movies but hadnt heard anything since hope it dosnt feel toned down for tv
anime,not_removed,relife started reading the manga a while back and its become one of my favorites same here i really thought it was a manhwa at first lol but its really great
anime,not_removed,i wouldnt call handakuns high school life better but definitely worth the watch
anime,not_removed,berseeeeeeeeeeerk i could care less about the cgi im just glad its happening
anime,not_removed,damn i better too since i remember liking d grayman but do not remember shit about it
anime,not_removed,do i have to watch the old dgrayman to catch it
anime,not_removed,consider watching the original love live first as sunshine is kind of a sequel with a different cast basically mc in sunshine is a µs fangirl group in original
anime,not_removed,heres hoping days is as good as baccano
anime,not_removed,planetarian is another key adaption you should check out
anime,not_removed,skipping out on most of the action series until other people begin judging them i think other stuff that seems interesting to me berserk though im guessing i should watch the original series first should try the manga instead tbh the art is just incredible and you get the full experience instead of a glossed version
anime,not_removed,rewrite is perhaps my favourite key vn and im saying that as a big fan of most of their stuff it does their usual things setting moe plot twists drama very well while also bringing a bunch of new ideas and genres into the mix that said im worried about the anime a bunch of different plot elements mean its more difficult to adapt than all of keys other vns and the studio animating it is best known for infinite stratos and the mangled grisaia adaptation check out the anime for sure just keep in mind that disliking the anime doesnt necessarily mean youll dislike the vn theres some great material there if youve enjoyed other key stuff
anime,not_removed,rewrite is a fantastic vn its the honorable mention in my top of all time
anime,not_removed,kono bijutsubu ni wa mondai ga aru i just binged the manga is really good
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,its not the were in highschool and i want to get into your pants romance but it definitely has romance at least in the manga
anime,not_removed,definitely s grifith and casca right
anime,not_removed,im so excited for planetarian unlike other key novels they wont have to cut out a large amount of content to adapt the novel
anime,not_removed,im hoping berserk turns out alright but if anything at least the manga should be off hiatus by then
anime,not_removed,amanchu is going to be incredible nothing can surpass the quality of the aria manga and amanchu is pretty ok at being the aria successor but for an anime i think it will really shine the trailer looks like it has way more budget than the aria anime had and the soundtrack is going to be the same style havent researched to see if its the same composer yet but i wouldnt be surprised if this show gets more people into the aria mangaanime i will be so happy also its a wonderful slice of life on its own right so theres that
anime,not_removed,the two shows are polar opposite i like your style
anime,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiattackoftheshow
anime,not_removed,i envy people with such broad taste and can like shows that end up being rated like a this list has like four shows that look potentially interesting to me
anime,not_removed,at best there are anime or so looking good here for me at least wtf
anime,not_removed,dont judge me if by now someone hasnt heard about how fucking gar is you can safely ignore their opinion entirely
anime,not_removed,as a warning you will probably need to read rewrite to understand everything thats going on i can provide reading order and a download though if you want
anime,not_removed,also that kizu bd is so close so close yet so far
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,do you want a download and reading order for rewrite
anime,not_removed,wait you liked active raid
anime,not_removed,genuinely hyped for this cant wait to see more unit shenanigans
anime,not_removed,rewrites structure works in such a way that adapting it to the anime format is impossible and for that reason id say give the vn a shot if youre up for the read it lasted me about hours but was a phenomenal experience and arguably keys masterpiece that said seeing the steps theyve been taking they really are trying to make sure the anime adaptation is not only faithful but good as well the biggest thing its success hinges on at this point is episode count its a long and complex story that needs all the time it can get to tell its tale
anime,not_removed,that is hard to say with all the info regarding the anime series rewrite fans have gathered it seems like they are trying to make a faithful adaptation really the only thing depending at this moment would be the episode count if it has a high episode count then it has a lot of potential they say this sixth route will be added on to the anime to help expand upon a heroine and help connect ideas to help translate it from vn to anime so it will ideally still have the other heroine routes as well as the true routes they want to make it so anime fans enjoy the anime as well so well wait and see
anime,not_removed,yes as a general rule of thumb you should always read the vnln because of the time its either a cashgrab or a rush job or even both unless its something short like planetarian but then again its like hours long so you might as well read the vn anyway
anime,not_removed,it ended on such a cliff hangar too i have been waiting for this day to come since the last season ended i personally think that dgray man is one of the best animes
anime,not_removed,ive been reading the manga the last few weeks and am completely caught up now july cant come soon enough gonna lose my shit when i watch it i cna just feel it
anime,not_removed,shhhhh at least we are getting the game soon
anime,not_removed,i couldnt stand season ive heard different people made it i had to drop it because it was so bad i still say its one of my favourite shows though
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,what about ultra despair girls its a fairly long story do we absolutely know it wont be relevant in the anime
anime,not_removed,wow our taste is so amazingly similar my watch list is relife rewrite orange new game amaama to inazuma days planetarian taboo tattoo amanchu kono bijutsubu shokugeki no souma ni no sara love live sunshine and yes i literally did just copy your list so oddly similar even our favorite shows are the same guessing monogatari
anime,not_removed,for berserk there are you need to watch to be caught up highly doable between now and and july
anime,not_removed,relife so banjo do you read the manga if so whos best girl
anime,not_removed,its an original project so it wont be rushed like the last one
anime,not_removed,best choice from the manga ok choice from the old series or the movie trilogy
anime,not_removed,it was probably planned as a split cour even before airing
anime,not_removed,apparently the creators of oregairu hentai ouji and date a live are working on qualidea code
anime,not_removed,is it just me or is there no battleschool harem ln adaptation this season masou gakuen
anime,not_removed,its the generic magical school harem theres at least one every season
anime,not_removed,nanatsu isnt season but a episode special
anime,not_removed,im just hyped for the oregairu ova
anime,not_removed,the current season is also great but yeah im hyped for the next season as well
anime,not_removed,all the games are standalone unless theyre sequels like tales of xillia and tales of xillia so you should be fine just watching the anime just be warned zestiria is seen as one of the worst games in the franchise but hopefully the anime will be solid
anime,not_removed,i do have to scroll right
anime,not_removed,i still tried to scroll right out of habit for some reason i thought my computer was freezing on me before i thought that maybe the chart was designed well
anime,not_removed,nope not that i know of anyway
anime,not_removed,with rewrite jun maeda has no involvement with the script or story he only composed a few songs for rewrite and thats all although rewrite is still a wild ride
anime,not_removed,rewrite isnt by maeda its by romeo tanaka the guy who wrote humanity has declined
anime,not_removed,could be fantastic could go gangsta on us deffo gonna give it a try though
anime,not_removed,if anything ranime is overly critical of ecchi
anime,not_removed,fatekaleid even though i still have to catch up on the previous season which i dropped half way trough because it was quite awful you can jump directly to episode of herz since the first half is filler
anime,not_removed,and i will also be trying out but i know basically nothing about them berserk you should probably learn about it first since its a sequel if youre still interested you need to watch either the berserk movies or preferably the anime and then the movie to be caught up for the new season
anime,not_removed,well it aired this season about a week ago
anime,not_removed,key vns tend to fall somewhere on a scale of jesus fuck what is wrong with her eyes to oh shit who cut all these onions is the pv if you want to check out
anime,not_removed,days sounds cool hopefully it doesnt go full gangsta prettymuch what i said kizu when jul according to the bottom
anime,not_removed,dont think its that much if any more than usual
anime,not_removed,yes you need to watch either the berserk movies or preferably the anime and then the movie to be caught up for the new season
anime,not_removed,so many anime dont deserve second or third seasons
anime,not_removed,the lack of nnt hype is probably because for the longest time you could only get it through sailing the seven seas i remember the threads on here being quite dead when it was airing
anime,not_removed,therell be a lot of great sequels next season regarding standalone series id keep an eye on tales of zestiria days amanchu and orange
anime,not_removed,ive read both manga and saw berserk movies berserk manga is something that anyone should read at some point in his life its fame as a classic masterpiece is totally deserved but if you dont feel like reading it id suggest to try at least the old anime series or the recent trilogy of movies dgrayman is not your typical battle shounen its gothic and the villains are really entertaining ive heard good things about the anime you can follow a guide to skip filler episodes if you want otherwise theres the manga which is pretty enjoyable
anime,not_removed,yes and a sequel to the film trilogy as well
anime,not_removed,i still have mangirl ptsd so ill watch this but im not getting my hopes up
anime,not_removed,there is a huge hole in my heart after ace of diamond ended a few months ago i assumed youve watched major before right
anime,not_removed,it was announced in april
anime,not_removed,its not a movie its the cover of fatekaleid a series airing next season i think they put that to fill the space
anime,not_removed,only episodes though
anime,not_removed,hm danganronpa series anyone know their chronological order in relation to the games based on the synopses the first is about the characters from and the second is about the characters from the implication is that the and characters are completely separate in other words the two shows are separate and dont have chronological interdependencies but thats just my speculation
anime,not_removed,chapter probably
anime,not_removed,id like to point out for danganronpa that the second game was never animated i dont recommend jumping in without looking at a plot synopsis first or playing the second game
anime,not_removed,the chronological order of the games anime bolded are games danganronpa the end of hopes peak academy despair chapter zetsubouhen danganronpa trigger happy havoc aka danganronpa another episode ultra despair girls spinoff danganronpa goodbye despair second installment danganronpa the end of hopes peak academy future chapter miraihen the second game is not going to be animated since its something that only games can do so future chapter is the direct continuation from danganronpa not from the anime although future chapters cast consist of the remaining survivors probably not all from the first gameanime and the characters from the second game most probably wont be in here as for the despair chapter it takes place before danganronpa game basically a prequel and the cast from danganronpa will be here so in order to watch danganronpa you need to know the story of danganronpa first which i really not recommend reading a summary or spoilers of it you really need to play it yourself if you dont have the hardware or the finance for it theres a gameplay of it everywhere on youtube though i suggest the one by nicob so if you are interested in playing the game please play danganronpa first and then dr another episode eventhough dr another episode takes place between and it spoils if you play it first
anime,not_removed,berserk will be a continuation of the old series and the recent movie trilogy you can start from either of them but if youre fine with reading manga id really recommend to read berserk from the start
anime,not_removed,its a continuation
anime,not_removed,its made by the guy who made mr ando of the woods and salarymanman he does the most hilarious and weird shit you can ever imagine im glad that he gets to run something officially as anime ill have to check it out
anime,not_removed,at least theres a plot he solves problems in ways only a fart can i for one am curious to know how many problems farts can solve
anime,not_removed,i for one welcome our banana overlord
anime,not_removed,what a time to be realive
anime,not_removed,so theres relife rewrite rezero and rewatch
anime,not_removed,rewatch relife rewrite and rezero
anime,not_removed,me too this season really will be one to remember
anime,not_removed,was the overall plot good though
anime,not_removed,try vagabond the hiatuses never end
anime,not_removed,i tried reading the manga because its apparently really amazing but i just cant im fine with romance but its shoujo there are decent ones with female mc and male mcs probably lots of drama not really my thing
anime,not_removed,isnt shigatsu a shounen from my observation it attracted more guys instead of girls
anime,not_removed,after all of the love that shigatsu got soooo i hated shigatsu but i am really looking forward to orange now i dont know how to feel uu
anime,not_removed,right after a certain magical index season
anime,not_removed,aw yiss that gay agenda™ finally showing results
anime,not_removed,have you spoken to our lord and saviour junko enoshima
anime,not_removed,getting people to read vn is nearimpossible in this sub if it gets popular youre going to get dangan roppa thread every hour about how do i watch this what is the source material this sucks its in the middle etc
anime,not_removed,as someone whos played the two main games do the other anime add anything important
anime,not_removed,nice one im close to catching updo you know if were gonna get a new emiya edit finally caught up to the latest chapter
anime,not_removed,literally just read the manga im not a manga supremacist but its significantly better
anime,not_removed,skip the first half its useless filler the plot gets back on track around episode from there on out its pretty good
anime,not_removed,its drei
anime,not_removed,thats the best kind of sports anime
anime,not_removed,ive never watched ace of diamond but that looks like something like that
anime,not_removed,no the studio mappa show is days and its about soccerfootball the baseball show is battery and its by zerog
anime,not_removed,havent seen the first season might get around to it at some point but it probably wont be for a while
anime,not_removed,you wont understand diddly squat if you havent these shows are a love letter aimed solely to the fans of the games considering theres no way to experience outside the game itself and the shows are designed to be watched both at the same time heavily interlinked if youre interested id heavily advise you give them a shot theyre on steam and a toaster can play them
anime,not_removed,you should play or at least watch a playthrough of dangan ronpa before watching either series zetsubouhen is a prequel to the events of while miraihen happens shortly after the second games story
anime,not_removed,you definitely have to play and theyre both on steam so you can easily play them without needing a vita now i highly recommend them especially some people say that ultra despair girls the person shooter spinoff will be important as well but unless thats coming to pc ill just read a summary of it but yeah watching without playing at least would be a massive mistake i highly recommend you play both games though even if youve seen the anime already the game has way more character development and interaction between characters plus the trials are really fun
anime,not_removed,the anime wont make any sense without you knowing the events of and so yeah
anime,not_removed,i loved naru hina and kenta they were so carefree i hope that light atmosphere continues in handakun although i doubt it without naru
anime,not_removed,all i can remember is dr robotnikearl
anime,not_removed,im reading the manga and im lost as fuckstill awesome though ill probably rewatch a couple of the last episodes to catch up on the story there
anime,not_removed,yes you do its a sequel
anime,not_removed,plus ll is really good
anime,not_removed,was wondering if i should read the vn for that one first may depend on the adaptation
anime,not_removed,figured someone would say that im not into action manga though would much rather see something animated
anime,not_removed,what the fuck
anime,not_removed,at least link a subbed version
anime,not_removed,was not expecting the s seconds of bee peropero
anime,not_removed,no fucking words
anime,not_removed,ye with a horse and a woman
anime,not_removed,pls nope
anime,not_removed,berserk off hiatus nice boat
anime,not_removed,ok nothing can surpass the quality of the aria manga nothing
anime,not_removed,images from the manga may contain small spoilers
anime,not_removed,i took scuba diving my last semester at college never took the certification or did the pool days though no car and busy with other classes when i saw this listed on animer chart websites i instantly picked this as an anime id start good to know it has high expectations
anime,not_removed,anime of the season
anime,not_removed,you mean his taste is shit right
anime,not_removed,i envy people who are more picky tbh some seasons like the current season has so many good shows that some weeks i have trouble finding time to watch what i picked up
anime,not_removed,tbh its mostly about giving the shows a chance rather than at least for me there are shows i want to check out of this season but ill probably end up dropping like or so thing is i dont want to miss out on something that could be potentially really good so i give most shows at least an episode or two since its not unusual for something that i really like to be something i didnt expect to
anime,not_removed,its weird im picky af in every other entertainment medium but for some reason anime bypasses all of my defenses and applies some sort of reversesturgeons law to my tastes i choose to be grateful this is the case
anime,not_removed,yeah i will watch shokugeki handakun and mob psycho with maybe arslan and thats it everything else didnt catch my interest at all dunno if i should be happy or lament having a type because then i often dont have much to watch
anime,not_removed,four shows is more than enough dont people have ptw backlogs to clear
anime,not_removed,im kind of like him i pick up almost every show that even remotely interests me and then just drop them after a few episodes if i dislike them i do envy people who only pick up like shows though since i always am behind schedule with this many shows
anime,not_removed,that would be great thanks i can never manage to find these things myself
anime,not_removed,am i blind or is it not listed
anime,not_removed,this image is from nekketsu so youll have to wait a lil longer
anime,not_removed,nah its fine i found a copy by navigating the seven seas a while ago its working or the first minutes are working at least i just need to find some time and motivation to read the whole thing
anime,not_removed,there are dozens of us dozens
anime,not_removed,liked it i frigging loved it
anime,not_removed,you didnt
anime,not_removed,it is not impossible but just hard
anime,not_removed,i have read the manga and i can say it only gets better
anime,not_removed,dude really wasnt that bad id call it good even i liked the god paradox as well as more of akanes badassery shimotsuki was an unlikeable character because she questioned akanes when we know full well how great akanes is and id call that a legitimate criticism but season wasnt terrible
anime,not_removed,ultra despair girls will very likely be relevant as well judging by its ending
anime,not_removed,i do love monogatari and it is one of my strong im considering reranking everything soon but clannad after story is my overall favorite anime
anime,not_removed,what about the show its not that i dont have time to watch the show and stuff its just i havnt really felt the want to do it
anime,not_removed,so banjo do you read the manga i dont if so whos best girl and since i dont i will just have to let you know my decision once it officially starts airing
anime,not_removed,the prequelish ln qualidea of scum and gold coin was great though
anime,not_removed,explains a few things but its from key so i expect wild rides all the time
anime,not_removed,honestly even better and you can clearly see the influence
anime,not_removed,yūto tonokawa little busters and higurashi umineko also helped write rewrite
anime,not_removed,yeah its a testament to how good the show is despite the ecchiness and im one of those dissenters to sketchy ecchi shows
anime,not_removed,im not sure where you got that idea this subreddit is full of drooling ecchi fans
anime,not_removed,oh thanks i knew there is one other anime but i was under impression i dont need to watch it i suppose i could get trough episodes and a movie over the summer edit after watching few reviews i feel like im also expected to read the manga is that so or do we not know yet
anime,not_removed,thank you
anime,not_removed,and so many anime that do
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,as a matter of fact i have not its on my mal but i havent taken the plunge is it on crunchyroll my absolute favourite baseball anime is still big windup it was my first anime ever and has a even bigger place in my heart than ace of diamond
anime,not_removed,odd wasnt it said it wasnt coming out in theaters and would be digital only
anime,not_removed,got ya i thought it was because its under the movie section is it part of the fate series or just happens to have the word fate in the title
anime,not_removed,for orange whyyyyy it deserves more
anime,not_removed,yup they dont have any chronological interdependencies miraihen future arc is a sequel to super danganronpa and zetsubohen despair arc is a prequel both arcs are meant to be watched at the same time ublinkarchon it goes in this order danganronpa trigger happy havoc super danganronpa goodbye despair danganronpa the end of hope peaks academy future arc despair arc
anime,not_removed,its japan an object it talkturn into a girl
anime,not_removed,i mean thats not that outlandisn tbh a lot of folklore around the world has fairy tales about antropomorphic months
anime,not_removed,which one is that
anime,not_removed,i am so fucking happy ando of the woods is my favorite thing on youtube
anime,not_removed,bananya overlord you philistine
anime,not_removed,rejoice
anime,not_removed,someone should make an amv featuring all of those shows to the tune of rere from erased
anime,not_removed,and then there is us the retards
anime,not_removed,yes i liked it a lot one of my favorite shoujos
anime,not_removed,yes it is great it will be the anime to watch this season i should probably check out bersek though
anime,not_removed,vinland saga was like this too its gotten better he use to write lots of short ass chapters and then a randomly long one now hes very consistent
anime,not_removed,stop making me cry i need a new chapter
anime,not_removed,nothing on prince
anime,not_removed,did someone say hiatus x hiatus though i heard its actually getting chapters now a days
anime,not_removed,im not saying that theyre the same thing but i think they will appeal to the same crowd lots of dem feels that being said i liked orange and couldnt get into shigatsu so give it a shot theyre pretty different in terms of storytelling
anime,not_removed,i had my own issues with ylia but no such problems with orange orange made me cry more in chapters than ylia partially because the characters are way more relatable and likable
anime,not_removed,i loved shigatsu and i think orange is a top tier shoujo manga
anime,not_removed,right after devil is a part timer season
anime,not_removed,stop it you will give people hope about ngnl
anime,not_removed,another good thing is that fansubs for dokyusei have just come out
anime,not_removed,hopefully it doesnt turn into a shitshow when animeonlies are told they need to play the games
anime,not_removed,they cant complain about vn elitism this time around since is literally a sequel to the second game that just happens to be an anime its made primarily for fans of the series and with the explicit intent that the viewer has played danganronpa
anime,not_removed,does dr count as a vn though i always thought of it as just a mystery detective kinda game more so than a visual novel
anime,not_removed,how long are the danganronpa vns i could probably pick them up in the summer sale but ive already got a backlog of vns to read that includes some pretty lengthy ones dont want to buy it and then never end up playing it although i probably will do that for a few games anyway
anime,not_removed,not really danganronpa the animation is an extremely poor adaptation of the first game since it rushes by everything every character gets fuck all screentime the investigationstrails are rushed to all hell and the answers are pretty much straight up told to the viewer within minutes the trail starting its pretty much what you would expect when squishing the entire games story into episodes with that said it was pretty nice hearing the characters fully voiced though if youre a fan of the dub im afraid youre out of luck since they recast almost everyone for the anime dub and seeing monokuma fully animated was pretty neat too but overall it was pretty bad and i wouldnt recommend it
anime,not_removed,s shirou has some pretty fucking badass moments in the manga if thats what youre asking close to heavens feel epic badass destroy everyone shirou
anime,not_removed,prisma illya manga is an ode to fate prisma illya anime is a chance to cash in on the yuri market
anime,not_removed,skip the first half its useless filler useless i enjoyed every filler episode they bring out great interactions between the cast
anime,not_removed,exhibit a ping pong
anime,not_removed,yeah but ace of diamond doesnt have all those super powers that end up having in kuroko love them both but at least ace of diamond is more based both really good shows though
anime,not_removed,oh whoops i got them mixed ill probably still be watching them
anime,not_removed,ah well hopefully you get to it sometime within the decade p god knows my backlog is insane to the point where im not sure ill hit up the shows i add anytime soon
anime,not_removed,i tried to download them onto my toaster but all it does is turn my bananas to jello
anime,not_removed,the dub on the steam trailer was painful is there a dual language option or mod
anime,not_removed,if ive seen the anime can i just skip the first game and play the
anime,not_removed,how could you forget rero best talking pumpkinubrellasword
anime,not_removed,i felt like the manga was almost intentionally confusing
anime,not_removed,vn is extremely short you could finish it in one day
anime,not_removed,i would read the vn it is short and you could play through it in a few hours
anime,not_removed,im not into action manga though would much rather see something animated i think in the case of berserk miura is really good at making easy to follow something i rather like about his artstyle and makes it enjoyable to read
anime,not_removed,fair enough
anime,not_removed,i mean obviously thats a penguin of course he isnt a human in disguise nope definitely not human
anime,not_removed,deleted
anime,not_removed,aria manga thank you the manga doesnt get nearly enough praise its honestly in my top manga of all time the art and paneling is crystal clear and paints a picture better than the show ever could kozoe amano is a goddess
anime,not_removed,is that president arias ancestor
anime,not_removed,guess im watching this anime
anime,not_removed,hes on ranime of course his taste is shit
anime,not_removed,deep down inside we are all seasonal trash
anime,not_removed,i know dem feels tt by the time the next season comes along i feel obligated to marathon the rest of the anime that i picked up but couldnt find time to watch so it doesnt clog up my watching list only to do it again the season after i really need to learn some self control
anime,not_removed,im currently watching episode of shows trying to catch up
anime,not_removed,hi im one of those picky people i never feel like i would want to watch more than what i have on my plate i say i found the perfect balance between pickiness and broadtastness that the shows i watch are all enjoyable to me and i am not overwhelmed i never realized this till now but i probably sound super narcissistic right now sorry but i wanted to share this realization i just had
anime,not_removed,tell me about it i still have several episodes of backlog in this season alone
anime,not_removed,imo way easier to be picky than not well i guess common sense would also suggest its easier to be picky literally just sample the anime that interest you and watch the or whatever that interest you the most
anime,not_removed,my opinion is split on one hand i could do a lot of things with the hours per week i spend watching anime and discussing the episodes on the other hand even so there are still anime i dont follow and i regret it
anime,not_removed,i give everything that sounds interesting a chance its just most dont sound interesting at all if i miss something i just list the new season on myanimelist by rating after a month or two and if a show is highly rated and i didnt watch it i pick it up
anime,not_removed,im like this time permits me to keep up with about shows so i watch about on week then knock out any shows that i have no interest in by episode ill have a handful of shows i enjoy watching im picky but picky with a broad scope to find out some hidden gems
anime,not_removed,alright route order is kotori chihaya shizuru akane lucia moon terra there should be instructions on how to get on every route in the folder but if necessary i can just tell you how do note the common route is a bit slow but starts getting very interesting about halfway through ive pmed you a download link if you need help with installation just ask
anime,not_removed,fuck
anime,not_removed,alright ill try to help with that too then its a long story but it tells a very complete story almost every character is pretty welldeveloped and the story is pretty tight but honestly thats not why i like it i like it because of the main character whos probably the most human character ive ever seen he never really differs from the core of his personality but he acts differently in every route because its a different circumstance sometimes dramatically so it also has a fucking amazing soundtrack hopefully this helps its still my favorite piece of media since i read it about two years ago
anime,not_removed,hell no it was garbage
anime,not_removed,considering that multiple routes in the vn occur during the same time with drastically different events yes it is impossible under the normal chronological anime format but i know theyre not doing that which is good i think itd only be possible under the omnibus format which would make things much simpler and very exciting for me personally
anime,not_removed,thats awesome close enough i guess clannad is my top you should make a heres mine im genuinely curious about yours to make your own httpsbighugelabscommosaicphp
anime,not_removed,for berserk the movies covers the same material as the show while the show does go into more detail about events the benefit of being a episode series the movies are more than sufficient and even include things the show skipped there is also berserk redux which is a fan edit of both the movies and the show but it is four hour and a half parts and is dubbed so if you are looking for the full package in a relatively short time thats what i would recommend
anime,not_removed,alright i just hope that you come to the right conclusion
anime,not_removed,even better
anime,not_removed,its such predictable tripe though
anime,not_removed,were not entirely sure yet but it doesnt seem so the only reason for reading the manga is because the anime leaves some important stuff out but that stuff is covered by the movie presumably from the character designs and other info weve seen the new season should transition into the mangas next arc conviction
anime,not_removed,mangirl was a show where all these girls run their own manga company it was so awful im now sceptical of any show where soley girls work in x company
anime,not_removed,personally i think major is one of the best sports anime ever made its definitely a mustwatch for anyone that likes sports anime
anime,not_removed,no idea i just googled july kingsglaive
anime,not_removed,its a spinoff of the fate franchise
anime,not_removed,no for nnt
anime,not_removed,there is a manga about a eye floater thats a cute girl so yeah
anime,not_removed,some people wished that horsegirl racing game was an anime
anime,not_removed,though i heard its actually getting chapters now a days it is and theyre insane
anime,not_removed,great the one thing that made me hate ylia was that i couldnt stand the characters
anime,not_removed,right after spice wolf
anime,not_removed,right after spice and wolf season
anime,not_removed,omfg did they its time
anime,not_removed,the previous adaptions werent that great either as the nature of vn adaptions so there will be game playing regardless
anime,not_removed,so was fate didnt stop the legion of hourly i want it anime only posts
anime,not_removed,yes ace attorney is also a vn for example
anime,not_removed,hours give or take vn reading time varies because you can chose to listen to dialogue or just read it going full completionist reading every alt scenes is closer to hours
anime,not_removed,i put about hours into the first game and about to hours story only into the game i guess you can probably do it faster than that since im pretty slow at finishing these kinds of games
anime,not_removed,s hf shirou has exactly victory to his name which is nine bullets revolver vs alter berserker that is in no way destroy everyone most of the route is him talking or out of commission sparks liner high he lost to saber crazy trains was a rider fight and vs kotomine his body gave out second he was dominated the entire fight
anime,not_removed,haha i was talking about the theme i just thought we might we a new remix to fit the tone or something but i really love tatsuyas version
anime,not_removed,dont get me wrong so did i but going from the tone of chren i dont think hes very interested in that and just wants plot progression and fight scenes
anime,not_removed,its a noitamina show and those are usually great so fingers crossed although unfortunatly because amazon got all the streaming rights for noitamina shows in the deal with fuji tv unless you live in the us or uk and have amazon prime youll be sailing the high seas
anime,not_removed,theres dual audio the japanese cast is absolutely god tier every game has a tier seiyuus
anime,not_removed,you can choose the original voice overs when you start the game
anime,not_removed,i highly recommend you play the first one even if youve watched the anime the anime is extremely rushed and basically leaves out almost all the character development during free time
anime,not_removed,i watched the anime then played the game you can skip it and be fine but there are some references in the that are not in the anime that would be a lot cooler if you played the game
anime,not_removed,its also not hard to adapt properly considering the lack of routes and short playtime the adaptation should be pretty comprehensive for a single season
anime,not_removed,wow this is beautiful makes the tokyo ghoul re fights looks like an amateur drew them
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,remindme days watch amanchu
anime,not_removed,i probably sound super narcissistic right now dont worry you dont tbh some seasons i feel the same as you but some seasons just have too many good stuff coming out i basically have to expend my mobile data to watch them outside of home else i wouldnt have time to watch all those that are in my opinion good i dont even watch shows per season either this season i am watching exactly and im already feeling overwhelmed this is in between watching all those good stuff from previous seasons or even from years ago
anime,not_removed,i started this season with around shows now im watching and am behind on of them but yeah id never have found classroom crisis for example if i wouldnt have started so many shows that season
anime,not_removed,uhh theres a section for ovabd and dvds down there
anime,not_removed,i am triggered
anime,not_removed,well of course they need to adapt it in omnibus format
anime,not_removed,something like this i have a ton of christmas wallpapers laying around for some reason
anime,not_removed,someone really likes their shoujo dramasromcoms eh
anime,not_removed,done im going to seek it out honestly i have been in an anime drought for the last few weeks after haiykuu ace of diamond and erased all ended within days of each other maybe this is the kickstart i need
anime,not_removed,eh that makes even less sense are they just doing the s vampire flashback arc with escanor theres no way they could fit s the ten commandments stuff in that time
anime,not_removed,and i thought i had seen it all with the manga about the cute cockroach girl
anime,not_removed,i am one of them and my only reasoning as that the song in the cm is amazing i still listen to it
anime,not_removed,insane in a good way or a bad way
anime,not_removed,togashis author comments are pretty interesting
anime,not_removed,this chain is depressing
anime,not_removed,this one hurts
anime,not_removed,this isnt an adaption though it is an orginal worked based on the previous vn and yeah you will have to play the game unless you want to be spoilered by the showdiscussion
anime,not_removed,fate at least ufos ubw anyway still works well enough as a stand alone danganronpas anime on the other hand really doesnt stand on its own two legs at all
anime,not_removed,fate reintroduces the main cast so the story still makes sense though because of fate people might assume that will do something similar and write us off as vn elitists
anime,not_removed,hours seems a bit short i put hours into the main story
anime,not_removed,shhhh let a man dream xd but youre right
anime,not_removed,ohhhhh i seethis really gets confusing with so many different damn meanings to the name however with that spoiler i can imagine the answer is yes
anime,not_removed,we are yes its been leaked
anime,not_removed,yeah i see now the plot is just gets times better after herz i cant wait to see the fight scenes animated
anime,not_removed,im already a seasoned sailor albeit one that likes to make catlike sounds
anime,not_removed,especially komaeda from the second game thats like ssstier voice acting if ive ever heard it
anime,not_removed,planetarian is like hours reading time you can fit it into a minutes movie easily
anime,not_removed,coincidentally one of my biggest problems with re is that ishida doesnt do action panels all that well theyre so incredibly hard to follow a lot of the times though he does do gorgeous work on key panels
anime,not_removed,here have some more panels from berserk httpiimgurcomtlbcoakjpg httpiimgurcomicixajljpg
anime,not_removed,overwatch and travelling to get drunk over bank holiday weekend has put me so far behind this week only managed to watch bnha rezero and tanakakun need to catch up on mayoiga flying witch kiznaiver and bungou stray dogs before i fall too far back
anime,not_removed,are already on my list i would put lb and ab up in like a top guess i should watch welcome to the nhk then i guess its the only one i havent seen or liked apart from toradora ami was best
anime,not_removed,well youre in luck because major is seasons long d
anime,not_removed,hey gokicha cockroach girls was suprisingly not bad
anime,not_removed,good way on the hxh sub a lot of people seem to be calling the current fight the best one yet sub is full of spoilers though just fyi
anime,not_removed,i meant like the previous games adaption werent great so you need to play the game anyway to understand this
anime,not_removed,it made as much sense as reading lord of the ring book first yes you kind of get what happened during the book but nothing else people will watch this people will sort of haphazardly pierce together what happened in the past then wtf where is the backstory this sucks posts will commence
anime,not_removed,like i said it depends on how fast you read and whether or not you listen to the dialogues in general anyway my total playtime for fsn is hours for example because i dont listen to dialogues and my reading speed is quite fast
anime,not_removed,he and naegi have the same voice actor although i prefer him her as komaeda
anime,not_removed,i actually dont know how exactly they plan on stretching it into an entire cour but its also david production so i am incredibly interested
anime,not_removed,holy hell that first one is absolutely insane the level of detail that must have gone into that is crazy
anime,not_removed,im debating on what i should even rate anymore clannad is easy because i love the music and listen to it every once in a while so it left a lasting impact but other current i have dont all fit that bill durarara and ngnl etc nhk would probably still remain as a even if i prune because the music when i could find it on youtube was excellent and the overall theme and heaviness of it makes it unique in my opinion
anime,not_removed,hype for hxh
anime,not_removed,yeah i personally thought it wasnt bad but the game was so much better i played the game before the anime as well but hey at least the op and ed were good
anime,not_removed,but there is no dialogue outside of trials
anime,not_removed,him va is megumi ogata though
anime,not_removed,it is going to be an ona series so there is no need for them to stretch it
anime,not_removed,its gonna be something like episodes or so it wont be stretched
anime,not_removed,in general anyway tldr your reading speed may vary
anime,not_removed,yeah i always forget she does such a convincing male voice
anime,not_removed,guess trump isnt against anime thats at least one thing i can agree on with him
anime,not_removed,this submission has been removed the content of your post does not appear to fit httpwwwredditcomranimewikiruleswikieverythingpostedheremustbeanimespecific have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,well personas are pretty much straightup based on stands they even reference jojo in the spinoff games personas have a bunch of generalized limitations on when they can be used only in the midnight channel only during the dark hour etc though which kinda automatically makes them worse that bit aside though most personas are literally deities if you remove the restrictions of the dark hourmidnight channelwhatever and actually let them affect other things they basically just become fullfledged shin megami tensei demons which means they probably wreck shit
anime,not_removed,its safe to assume personas were based off of stands a lot of things are based off of them persona powers are vague and often limited the threats found in the persona series arent that big either even though nearly every main persona antagonist is capable of destroying the world if personas are to their demon counterparts found in the smt franchise then maybe after all demons and gods can kill god and lucifers top generals in their multiverse war stuff but it seems unlikely persona and casts could freely use their personas in the real world and affect real things but they were still getting fucked over by bombs knives and muggings
anime,not_removed,considering demons and therefore personas can achieve immunity absorption or even reflection from all forms of damage just baring almighty skillswhich can not be blocked by anything and the fact that higher level being can use what is basically the equivalent to a small scale nuclear bomb along with summoning floods even death clouds id say higher level persona would stomp stands by sheer fact that theyre importal to everything but divine intervention and can do some really dumb things but stands would destroy anything that isnt at least mid tier demon and even then most of the stronger stands woulds be able to crush them up until the literal immortal nuclear holy death summoning demons
anime,not_removed,that was awesome best thing to come out of aldnoah
anime,not_removed,this is actually pretty fucking awesome
anime,not_removed,that was awesome

anime,not_removed,thanks
anime,not_removed,much appreciated
anime,not_removed,more consistent art and animation on ssy improves the show for obvious reasons i dont mind the common criticism of the characters lack of depth too much its not what the shows about
anime,not_removed,the only real flaw i have with my favourite show is the mc but if i take him out the show doesnt really work anymore unsure amagami ss is the show btw
anime,not_removed,s get rid of the earth cultlike hell make it like a secret earth government revival or just ditch it entirely i understand they wanted to add in terrorism to show us obstacles to governmental control im guessing but damn it just annoying for me yeah what i said was completely subjective
anime,not_removed,iron out the story a bit for the first half of trigger was kinda just winging it for the story at the start before reaching a point where they got things nailed down while it did not bother me much people who want to to dig into the story of the show will have to wait a while have to deal with the initial chaos of the plot
anime,not_removed,gintama with much better animation during the shogun arc give more screentime forhitagi from the monogatari series and less screentime for shinobu shes an okay character but all her arcs are extremely boring owarimonogatari was about to become my favorite entry in the series but then shinobu mail happened its now my favorite
anime,not_removed,s rework the train sequence that pushes sayaka over the edge the thugs ranting about how stupid women are really wasnt necessary and i think it makes this the weakest scene in the entire show
anime,not_removed,the density of the two legendary known great walls of china it would make it significantly better most likely
anime,not_removed,can i remove mika shimotsuki
anime,not_removed,i would remove the final arc from and have it end at episode just like utena
anime,not_removed,rolo from code geass
anime,not_removed,lotgh kill off one of the alliance main characters or at least change them so that theyre not secretly insane tactical geniuses who can somehow handily annihilate imperial forces with less than half the manpower its fucking annoying i do want to see yang kick ass because hes supposed to match reinhards prowess i do not want to see fucking poplan singlehandedly destroy the entire enemy fighter squadron in literally every single fight just because or s remove julians plot armor and his stupid ability to constantly guess exactly which strategy the empire is planning to use in a given fight and then convince yang to follow his advice pulled out of his ass despite having absolutely zero commanding experience whatsoever
anime,not_removed,the amount of episode in grisaia no kajitsu from to
anime,not_removed,the only thing i would change about steinsgate is that cringe scene between okabe and ruka
anime,not_removed,endless eight the concept is okay they could have done more cool things with it
anime,not_removed,redo the dub for samurai x trust and betrayal while i dont find it nearly as cringeworthy as when i first watched it and actually see some small brilliance to it it needs to be redone
anime,not_removed,eva isnt my fava but imagine if they replaced shinji with kamina
anime,not_removed,visual touch ups and some improvements to the pacing particularly during the first third of the show
anime,not_removed,off topic howd you make mousing over the image reveal a message i thought all you can do is add top and bottom text
anime,not_removed,the mc is a gift and all his fetishes too
anime,not_removed,not spoiling wraths indentity in ep of fma b can you refresh my mind i dont remember well
anime,not_removed,this comment has been removed untagged or improperly tagged spoilers are not allowed repeated violations of this rule will result in a ban have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,i liked the concept of the earth cult i just didnt like the grand bishop
anime,not_removed,most people didnt like that aspect me included
anime,not_removed,interesting i think that the first third of kill la kill is the strongest point in the series the middle third is much weaker but still good and the final third brings it back together
anime,not_removed,supposedly that was inspired by an actual conversation that urobuchi heard while on a train i agree though that bit was a bit too hamfisted cant think of the word
anime,not_removed,thats odd i would have gone with replacing the grand bishop with a character that is less generically evil in order to prove as a nice foil for both of the coprotagonists hes practically straight out of central castings stereotypes complete with the evil laugh trope
anime,not_removed,s the story wouldnt happen without hanekawa though
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,commentface put hover text here kaorusmile its simple and adds more room for text
anime,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomranimewikicommentfaces
anime,not_removed,it was a filler that takes place after the events of the beginning if that made any sense the frost alchemist talks about some stuff
anime,not_removed,ep was an anime original episode where some ice alchemist was doing something bad
anime,not_removed,so spoiling which is also an anime original of a ep show is bad
anime,not_removed,hamfisted is the perfect phrase to describe that scene even if urobuchi heard that entire conversation verbatim in real life it doesnt make it any less silly or extreme i absolutely adore madoka magica but this one scene is the only part in the entire show that i cringe at when im watching it with someone
anime,not_removed,dont get me wrong i thought terraism was stupid too but i felt that the weird imbalance of power between the empire and the alliance was even more annoying especially because it was ultimately pointless and served only to piss me off for no reason and it appeared in the story much more often than terraism
anime,not_removed,budgetsmile thanks a lot
anime,not_removed,i didnt understand hover text meant this when i first read that page am not a native speaker thanks though
anime,not_removed,you mean within that first episode i just scam it and the only thing he says about him is s youre dead bradley and maybe s you dont know the true face of this country
anime,not_removed,i wouldnt say s wraths identity is clearly spoiled in ep which would make you pointing it out a spoiler
anime,not_removed,s in the context of this chain you just spoiled that bradley is wrath you should probably tag that
anime,not_removed,oh youre right sorry about that i watched the original fma first so it was pretty obvious for me
anime,not_removed,editted telling him s that he will kill him is a spoiler of his identity
anime,not_removed,replace him with wrath in your statement and you directly state his identity
anime,not_removed,ah shit
anime,not_removed,you wouldnt happen to have a twitter link for this would you
anime,not_removed,those eyes look terrifying love it
anime,not_removed,thats really good for a phone drawing thats better than what i do with my tablet
anime,not_removed,am i wrong
anime,not_removed,just ig and da sadly
anime,not_removed,thanks
anime,not_removed,it just feels weird for me using a tablet looking at the screen and then drawing on a tablet if i had a cintiq though
anime,not_removed,no i just wasnt aware of her age and it makes shipping her with kajika problematic

anime,not_removed,im not so sure myself
anime,not_removed,ah i didnt get the joke smacks forehead
anime,not_removed,hmmm doesnt matter much that the post was removed now
anime,not_removed,well yeah now it doesnt really matter i will be a bit careful from now on though sorry about that
anime,not_removed,to be honest i would refrain from making rem jokes alltogether were pretty strict on them and while i think they shouldve been okay in this context you and the other guy making the same joke in this thread each received reports
anime,not_removed,ah i see well rezero is that kind of series this season with its popularity and fear of spoilers lurking around every corner much like bokumachi steinsgate etc ill be careful next time with the remming thanks for the warning
anime,not_removed,ow sorry bout that i thought that joke was all over the internet already
anime,not_removed,please keep it out of ranime

anime,not_removed,its shit cuz jojo is shit downvote me already
anime,not_removed,also jojo spoilers
anime,not_removed,easiest fucking question of my life mods feel free to remove this as answered
anime,not_removed,fucking typo now i look like even more of an idiot
anime,not_removed,i cant delete this one on the version of reddit im using i could repost but then there would be two
anime,not_removed,i take back my previous statement you win i didnt even recognize the show but it was amazing
anime,not_removed,i dont even know what its parodying but thats gold pure gold thank you thank you so much
anime,not_removed,even more at least you know it
anime,not_removed,i was originally going to comment fucking typo now i look like an idiot but i knew i was setting myself up so yeah
anime,not_removed,a lot of people give this arc a lot of flak for dragging on for too long but the last episodes just go by so fast and still with its twists and turns throughout the game it keeps itself interesting the climax of chinchiro and kaijis victory vs the bog and endous trickery sums up everything i love about this series
anime,not_removed,welcome to the discussion thread for episode the future is in our hands weve come full circle back to the original op lyrics seeing that final in the thread title makes me sad here we go the final episode kaiji tries to motivate ichijou as hes taken away i dont know if we ever hear from him again but itd be great if ichijou made a return someday kaiji endoh and sakazaki are rich af sakazaki offers his daughter to kaiji kaiji is afraid endoh endoh what are you doing endoh stop kaiji suffers again always read contracts fully and carefully people snap i just noticed the hotel name hotel akagi reference ahoy kaiji gets excited to see his friends the moe is in full force he also saves ishidas son kaiji is so kind and then he goes and gambles away the last of his money he is now broke again sorry kaiji you may have beaten the bog but it sucked up the rest of your luck not everyone at teiai is an absolute asshole though one black suit guy gives kaiji so hes not broke kaiji becomes ultimate moe and then the most ultimate move madhouse pulled was playing the op from season one when kaiji meets up with his friends matching the title of the episode dat last shot of kaiji pulling on his jacket at the end what a badass discussion questions as soon as endoh pulled out a contract i knew hed trick kaiji you just cant trust endoh if i was sakazaki id give kaiji some of my share id still be pretty rich either way
anime,not_removed,because usually the winner is a new girl that comes into the mcs life rather than one he already knows the new girl is there to set the plot in motion so shes typically the focus of the story and as a result the winner
anime,not_removed,because god is punishing us
anime,not_removed,because of the time they are unwilling to risk confessing their unrequited love until it is too late from a plot perspective though childhood friends that have a secret crush is a cheap source for romance drama not that you cant have it used well but often it seems to be because its easy drama
anime,not_removed,s all of them are childhood friends except best girl tsugumi so that means she wins by default right
anime,not_removed,yuishrug
anime,not_removed,because god is a fan of ntrcucking
anime,not_removed,because people like the love at first sight fated meeting thing to explain love notice how anime often skip out of the part where a couple is just hanging out and doing friend things something horimiya is excelling at so a new interesting person is preferred to a person the protagonist would mostly hang out with where not every mundane action together would be special and big because they were interacting closely for a long time anyway also because god hates us
anime,not_removed,because if it hasnt happened by now it isnt going to happen as for kiznaiver it is possible that sonozaki is actually the childhood friend not chidori
anime,not_removed,kiznaiver isnt s technically the longest tenured childhood friend
anime,not_removed,maybe because most childhood friends dont get into a relationship even in real life
anime,not_removed,another example is your lie in april the childhood friend tsubaki loses
anime,not_removed,the emergence of the imouto archetype who had all the advantages of a childhood friend plus the fun hoodoo
anime,not_removed,because the childhood friend is no better than the dense mc you never see the childhood friend take any initiative until main girl shows up so i have no sympathy towards them either
anime,not_removed,most of the time theyre trash like onodera manami
anime,not_removed,while the childhood friend is new to the viewer theyve always been there for the mc theres less mystery and intrigue in the friend youve always known those little traits that make them so cute to the viewer mckun has built up an immunity over years of exposure no matter what happens chidori will be fine if you like chidori why would you want her with katsuhiro at this point in the show he has so little personality if shes your best girl you should want better for her
anime,not_removed,i feel like its because theres no reason why the mc would randomly start having feelings for the childhood girl
anime,not_removed,its actually more relatable this way the relationship is already established your my friend and why complicate a good thing this is the same thought process that creates the friend zone in real life
anime,not_removed,because theyre status quo and the new girl who always comes into the characters life is more interesting for the hero so he goes for her instead its kinda fucked when you think of it that way
anime,not_removed,my problem with childhood friends always boils down to one key point most authors making these stories never wanted the child hood friend to win and this shows in the story as the childhood friend often holds the title in name only ie the discussions they have with the mc show no signs of a long friendship instead taking on the form of the friendship you had and lost with someone back in grade another important point when it comes to childhood friends would be that they tend to never really have anything special going for them in manga and at times anime they tend to be drawn in a very plain style with no attention paid to their features and color schemes the childhood friends tend to be colored with dull colors while the new love interest is drawn using bright and shiny colors so in short childhood friends are not supposed to win in close to of cases
anime,not_removed,because it injects a bit of realism or sometimes drama into a work are there people who end up in relationships with or married to childhood friends yes but many more dont for a number of reasons sometimes no matter what you do your childhood friend might choose to be with someone elseand theyre within their rights to do so thats their choice to make just because youve known himher since kindergarten doesnt mean youre entitled to be with himherand that goes for an anime character as well
anime,not_removed,currently watching kiznaiver and am looking for consolation after what seems to be chidoris incoming heartbreak but shes not childhood friends with tenga
anime,not_removed,currently watching kiznaiver and am looking for consolation after what seems to be chidoris incoming heartbreak but come on s nori is like even more childhoodier friend to kacchon than chidori chances are unless trigger pulls of some crazy ass shit a childhood friend is going to win s that and nori isnt an annoying tsundere who just cant communicate at all well shes not that good with communication but at least she isnt being a bitch about problems shes causing herself like chidori is
anime,not_removed,because theyre worst girls
anime,not_removed,because no one can remember them
anime,not_removed,deep down i know you make a good point but its just heartbreaking to see a character express themselves so openly and get ignoredrejected many times by the person they love usually in shows like this sakurasou for example i end up disliking the main character for not being able to see how good of a person they have so close to them already
anime,not_removed,i mean she winsif you go by process of elimination
anime,not_removed,trash like onodera shittaste
anime,not_removed,chitoge is a childhood friend mate
anime,not_removed,my rationale was that chidori loves katsuhiro at this moment so ill support her wholeheartedly if she gives up on her love because of sonozaki then id be devastated
anime,not_removed,i dont see how thats relevant its not like shes gonna end up with tenga
anime,not_removed,ah come on theyre teenagers dont be so hard on them its not easy to confess for the first time s and in the latest episode chidori finally gathered her courage to do so
anime,not_removed,madsaitama
anime,not_removed,at least can people agree that koko is best girl
anime,not_removed,i end up disliking the main character for not being able to see how good of a person they have so close to them already see i never get why people think this yea shes a good person but what does that matter not once did sorata ever display any romantic feelings for her and he never lead her on he saw her as a good friend why should he be compelled to fall in love with her just because she has feelings for him he likes shiina and she was the only person who ever had a chance
anime,not_removed,i feel you love me some childhood friends and also dislike that they get rejected most of the time
anime,not_removed,i always wondered about the childhood friends or the girls who are openly like the mc and keep expressing their feelings but get rejected what if the mc doesnt have feelings for her should he end up with her because she is a good friend and a good person since they were children and she likes him what about his feelings and what he wants just wondering
anime,not_removed,oh man i hated sakurusou precisely because of that i find it aggravating how they always make the childhood friend fall in love with the mc but not the other way round whats the point just let them be two friends and nothing more if thats how youre going to do it but noooo for some inexplicable reason the girl falls in love with him and proceeds to get shafted by the main love interest its total bollocks man am i salty
anime,not_removed,s mc meets and fall in love with talented saxophone player they spend three years together but she is unfortunately hit by a random trunk while going to their graduation performance tsubaki helps to pick up the pieces s mc falls in love with talented pianist she dies of cancer tsubaki helps to pick up the pieces s mc finally realizes he loves tsubaki he confesses and she dies of heart failure as a result of all the shit the mc made her deal with over the years mc spends the next years alone creating his magnum opus but dies before he can finish it
anime,not_removed,the truth is there is no competition in nisekoi from best to worst theres chitoge then a huge pit of fucking nobody next comes shuu then there is the rest of the girls
anime,not_removed,yes but she isnt trash
anime,not_removed,i feel you im just rationalizing early in case it goes south
anime,not_removed,grouphug hey this sort of attitude is what i should be having no way chidori is going to end up with anybody other than katsuhira mark my words
anime,not_removed,s except she didnt confess well okay a statue cut her short but maybe if she just blurted it out faster i will excuse her for that but not the second episode confessing instantly taking it back just because tsunderes gonna tsundere yeesh
anime,not_removed,i suppose thats just me being biased ill give that one to you however currently in kiznaiver the mc is doing exactly what youre saying hes leading chidori on and keeps dodging her confessions while he clearly already knows about her feelings
anime,not_removed,damn this manic pixie dream girls coming to light your world if theres a childhood friend your world is already ok
anime,not_removed,a lot of the time love can grow from gratitude someone who has always been there for you and always supports you in times of need displays really admirable and attractive qualities if the main character didnt have feelings for her initially its definitely possible for love to spring anew
anime,not_removed,not everyone can win in love
anime,not_removed,first spoiler you have now been tagged as the disciple of seo kouji
anime,not_removed,wait this isnt real is it
anime,not_removed,shuu is literally the greatest nisekoi character you wot
anime,not_removed,marika hello
anime,not_removed,seems like you are forgetting best girl tsugumi
anime,not_removed,s im sure she did confess it was just drowned out by the sound of the typhoon and you can even see her speaking as katsuhiro goes to open the doors
anime,not_removed,hes really not doing crap to chidori i mean his emotions were literally drained out of himhypothesized i cant really blame the dude there
anime,not_removed,yea youre right about it being a popular trope but aggravating as it is its what japan likes there are a bunch of nonharem anime where the childhood friend wins though theyre not competing against anyone but i understand how you feel it sucks that of the time you can tell who will win by the first episode sometimes just from reading the synopsis
anime,not_removed,this can be said for male friends or family too but i get what you mean but sometimes that great person who is always for you there is a chance you will never see him in a romantic way or because you have feelings for another
anime,not_removed,yes but why have the childhood friend fall in unrequited love in the first place of course this could happen but come on not in every fucking romance show where there exists a female childhood friend please its a ridiculously overused cheap plot device
anime,not_removed,he is fantastic my list was based on love interest though p
anime,not_removed,shes going to drop dead from whatever disease she has raku wont even notice and hell go bang chitoge or something
anime,not_removed,s okay ill give her that but mark my words in the next episode unlike normal people going hey you didnt hear me so ill just say it again shes going to back down again because jealous tsundere s also her love is disturbingly like jealousy for nori she and kacchon are childhood friends and she ambiguously has loved him for years without ever telling him she only starts acting lovestruck the moment someone else takes interest in kacchon either its a really weird coincidence or then she just acts and thinks like she somehow owns kacchon only taking action if theres risk shell lose him edit i accidentally a word
anime,not_removed,can you give some examples
anime,not_removed,if youre going to create a harem show with a male lead that everyone and their mother falls in love with for no fucking reason then the childhood friend is going to fall in line i agree though but it seems this is what the masses want so this is what the market is selling
anime,not_removed,i hear ya trust me im not the biggest fan of it either
anime,not_removed,dude s thats just anemia
anime,not_removed,well you know how the saying goes you dont know what you have until its gone thats probably how her mind is working ill hold you to that prediction
anime,not_removed,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
anime,not_removed,thats definitely true but its not just harems most notably in triangles like sakurasou the three types of romance are a harem childhood friend loses b triangle childhood friend loses c vanilla childhood friend does not exist now on a few extremely rare occasions the childhood friend wins and this will be in a vanilla romance eg cross game a large part of the frustration is due to the archetypes typically used for the childhood friend a character who is hard working upbeat and confident at least outwardly maybe theyre a little tsundere and they tend to bottle things up i usually end up liking this type of character a lot more than whatever incredibly exciting girl the mc goes doki doki over its not that i particularly think the childhood friend should end up with the mc i just i just want her to be happy ╥﹏╥ edit formatting
anime,not_removed,wow thats depressing
anime,not_removed,chinosmirk
anime,not_removed,eh s i thought asa was the only one who didnt know the mc as a child
anime,not_removed,for shuffle she wasnt a childhood friend
anime,not_removed,thanks baka to test he doesnt end up with pinkhaired girl gokukoku no brynhildr isnt she not the childhood friend

anime,not_removed,mars of destruction
anime,not_removed,pretty sure its mars of destruction not sure tho
anime,not_removed,its infamous for a reason
anime,not_removed,episode had aired june so a few days later
anime,not_removed,no information at this time if i remember right netflix is pretty bad about giving a heads up for anime things just pop up sometimes including airings
anime,not_removed,the got so the first half might be uploaded very soon otherwise updating the page like that would be kinda pointless
anime,not_removed,sangatsu no lion animated by shaft directed by akiyuki shinbou from the author of honey and clover won the manga taishou award in won the kodansha manga award in and won the grand prize of the tezuka osamu cultural prize in no way this wont be good
anime,not_removed,for everyone who hasnt watched natsume yuujinchou i would highly recommend it this fall season will be airing and although i havent finished yet onhold for awhile this is probably one of the best shows ive ever watched
anime,not_removed,definitely watching and will probably love haikyuu hibike natsume yuujinchou koe no kitachi checking out yuri on ice kiss him not me drifters
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,more reminders that i need to watch ajin haikyuu and hibike with all of the praise it gets i might have to pick up natsume too eventually
anime,not_removed,haikyuu and koe no katachi hype i hope koe no katachi will screen in my countryif not ill have to wait for the blu ray anyone know what i should look out for
anime,not_removed,i dont understand ranime one minute people complain how there arent enough original series in the anime industry and perhaps that there are too many adaptations of light novels visual novels and manga thereby stumping the creativity of writers and preventing truely great anime from being created but then they and the next second theyre all saying that a season is lackluster or not very hype since they dont recognize anything on the list ive counted original anime that are coming out next season so if this isnt the season for anime writers and directors to show what theyve got then i dont really know when else theyll be able to do it also i know that no one is saying that itll necessarily be a bad season but the mood in the comment section definitely isnt helping the thought
anime,not_removed,im stupidly hyped for
anime,not_removed,keijo will probably get blown off as a joke and get a ton of drops after the first episode due to its synopsis but a lot of people will be missing out after the introductory episodes are finished and they get going into matches the extremity of the fanservice takes a massive dive at its core its a hotblooded sports shounen and i was just as hyped from the manga as i was from something like haikyuu the ecchi really does take a backseat in this series
anime,not_removed,there are quite a few sequels this season im looking forward to hibike euphonium haikyuu gundam iron blooded orphans ajin a few of them had pvs that caught my interest flip flappers had some cool sakuga yuri on ice basically endless night shuumatsu no izetta using a rifle as a flying broomstick lol aside from that theres not much that has my attention yet ill see where the first episodes and discussions go and hopefully therell be some cool surprises
anime,not_removed,so many great sequels ajin haikyuu hibeke euphonium bungou stray dogs natsume yuujinchou zegapain cant wait
anime,not_removed,another good looking season things im pretty excited for ajin the first season surprised me a lot by how good it was so im really looking forward to this haikyuu come on its haikyuu of course its gonna be great drifters adaptation of a manga by the same author as hellsing same character designer as hellsing ultimate and the director also worked on hellsing ultimate at the very least it could be a very fun action anime shuumatsu no izetta looks to be a magical girlwitch story taking place during that alone is enough to pique my interest mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku magic girl survival games that just sounds really awesome girlish number original anime by wataru watari aka the creator of oregairu plus its set in college which is a nice change of pace flip flappers cant honestly figure out what this show is gonna be like but it looks like a ton of fun udon no kuni no kiniro kemari seems to be next seasons single parent anime every one of those ive watched have been great no lion shaft shinbou koe no katachi also interested in mahoutsukai no yome hoshi matsu hito bungou stray dogs all out yuri on ice nanbaka fune wo amu long riders stella no mahou watashi ga motete dousunda eh fuck it why not keijo trickster edogawa ranpo shounen tanteidan yori classicaloid magic★kyun renaissance damn it i said i wasnt gonna watch so much anime next season
anime,not_removed,fall sangatsu no lion looks interesting while i have never played shougi before i played chess a lot growing up would be fun to learn more about this game that i sometimes see during other anime and keijo sounds so ridiculous that i will definitely be checking it out come the fall
anime,not_removed,that gakuen handsome holy shit senpai club can into real anime
anime,not_removed,to be honest i see nothing that i am hyped about this is pretty weak for a fall season
anime,not_removed,whos hyped for that monmusu ova
anime,not_removed,i am stupidly excited for this show just judging on genre alone looks really good and im pretty excited about it it also has a red head so it cant be that bad can it
anime,not_removed,maximum hype for gundam ibo and im in for ajin and bungou stray dogs anything else will have its chance but i dont see anything really interesting
anime,not_removed,whaaaat brave witches no way
anime,not_removed,sequels im looking forward to natsume yuujinchou go finally the fifth season hibike euphonium i need more asuka bungou stray dogs second season i actually liked the first one so ajin second season need more satou and if i get to the previous seasons soon haikyuu and gundam iromblooded orphans new anime to watch trickster edogawa rampo hope its better than the lerche one but with similar quality good op and ed fune no amu source is a novel so im naturally curious all out its a sports anime what more can i ask for udon no kuni no kniro kemari looks like a sweet sol touken ranbu hanamaru its doga kobo with a fantasy anime im curious to see how it goes long riders ill be honest i just want it to be bakuon with bicycles but ill take whatever i get drifters ive been waiting so long for this the pvs for this have looked amazing and it took forever to get the yuri on ice its sports plus mappa so just within my strike zone girlish number written by wataru watari he can really take a generic setting and make an interesting story so im looking for more of that shuumatsu no izetta witches magic military and historical settingwwii junketsu no maria didnt disappoint me so high hopes for this no lion heard good things about it shows ill consider soushin shoujo matoi its white fox with a different setting hopefully itll be good mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku hopefully it goes full dark or do something different else i might pass luger code original anime by deen so its either the best thing ever or the opposite cant wait to find out keijo i regret stereotyping cheer danshi this season so ill at least see if it tries to be more than just fanservice nanbaka need some kind of comedy to watch watashi ga motete dosunda same as above but im not too fond of the fujoshi archetype in most anime nazotokine just for fun i think its a pretty decent season and continues the trend of hype sequels with some promising new anime maybe i just watch too much but i think people are just comparing it to current season which is pretty amazing for normal standards
anime,not_removed,flip flappers vivid strike shoushin shoujo matoi tis the season for magical girls also i spy with my little eye a toei passion project with precure staff that will surely soar under everyones radar
anime,not_removed,holy hell three male idol anime next season thats unexpected ah fuck it ill watch all three anyway will watch ajin bungou stray dogs dream festival majikyun renaissance touken ranbu utapri watashi ga motete dousunda i read the manga yuri on ice might watch girlish number idol memories mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku nobunaga no shinobi nyanbo tama friends trickster edogawa ranpo udon no kuni
anime,not_removed,drifters hypeeee
anime,not_removed,fall is stacked af well atleast for me sequels hibike haikyuu ajin bungou stray dogs okusama ga seitokaichou natsume yuuchinjou go more exercising seems interesting usagi drop but with fantasy looks similar to madoka i think ͡ಠ ͜ʖ ͡ಠ made by shaft not sure about this one but i guess i watch it for the va heard that this is not yaoi should be interesting more idols is always good the is decent and looks like it sets in i think lots of men asses in this one i give it a shot
anime,not_removed,god i have to avoid everything persona related here too february cant come soon enough
anime,not_removed,tiger fucking mask
anime,not_removed,ajin hype other than that there isnt much that appeals to me
anime,not_removed,fall season for my taste is meh not worth really watching anything except ajin but thats it
anime,not_removed,sangatsu no lion or yuri on ice will be aots not counting sequels
anime,not_removed,clasicalloid isnt being done by trigger and thats sad but i still have the utmost confidence that this show is going to reach my quota for anime weirdness this season
anime,not_removed,a couple of things i am interested in checking out in the fall hibike euphonium have to watch the first season posthaste keijo flip flappers watashi ga motete dousunda shuumatsu no izetta sangatsu no lion trickster edogawa ranpo shounen tanteidan yori touken ranbu hanamaru fune wo amu drifters also i thought occulticnine from was coming out announcement on august might be a winter release though
anime,not_removed,this only reminds me more that there wont be re zero next season notraining
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,deleted
anime,not_removed,no high school battle harem i dont want to live on this planet anymore lets seeim not going to judge a season based off a list of summaries but my expectations are certainly set low i have two basic ways of deciding on what anime to watch each season first way i read the charts and see what looks interesting second way i keep an ear out for good opinions regarding the stuff i didnt pick up through the first way the first way is more reliable than the second way and is responsible for most of my favorite picks of a season though the second way does bring me some gems that i would have looked over re zero was one this seasonthis season is the first time ive looked at a chart and gone meh at pretty much the whole thing ikusei keikaku is about the only thing that gets a watch out of me that doesnt mean its all terrible mind you but im basically going to be depending on you all to tell me what in here is worth watching
anime,not_removed,looks good sequel wise dont know about any really hyped new ips besides koe no katachi yuri on ice and drifters theres new mahou shoujo anime also one by white fox and one by lerche so hopefully theyre good i think my most anticipated is haikyuu udon no kuni no kiniro kemari also looks cute
anime,not_removed,i always see people complain that season is not good but i always find at least shows to watch and enjoy for the most part but man this season actually does look pretty bad im only interested in a few shows okusama watashi ga motete shuumatsu sangatsu for sure and maybe udon keijo and nanbaka i guess a good time to catch up on some older stuff this doesnt include movies or ovas though
anime,not_removed,rugby show has better butts than keijo shit damn
anime,not_removed,wheres nanatsu no taizai second season i thought it was planned to air on of august or does it not count under the fall season
anime,not_removed,ive said it every season for a long time and ill say it again still no good seinen not a season worth watching
anime,not_removed,if you havent seen gundam ibo yet now is the time to start boys and girls its awesome and you dont need to watch any of the other gundam shows to understand whats happening
anime,not_removed,anyone else hyped about the tenchi muyo season i thought for sure the series was over after the
anime,not_removed,looks rather weak nothing im too hyped for
anime,not_removed,is dream festival supposed to be like a male version of aikatsu seems interesting either way ill probably give it a watch
anime,not_removed,other than the usual sounds interesting enough i wish there were actual scans of the manga other than the teasers though
anime,not_removed,hyped for keijo okusama and the gintama ovas not much else ill be watching next season besides maybe girlish number and a few ovas though
anime,not_removed,this isnt looking to be that good of a season for the only shows im interested in are lostorage incited wixoss and flip flappers lots of sequels to shows i never watched or didnt like so not much to get excited over as far as ovas go im excited for yahari and non non biyori ovas at least
anime,not_removed,i must admit keijos synopsis got me sold ͡ಠ ͜ʖ ͡ಠ
anime,not_removed,two knb movies in two months yessss
anime,not_removed,drifters sounds a lot like fatezero
anime,not_removed,the monster hunter stories anime seems interesting but im prepared to be let down then again its made by the jojo people so i dont know what to think if it has epic battles like the games do then it will be worth it
anime,not_removed,im interested in because its reminding me of bakumon but im sure ill be mistaken and those two guys will be kissing by episode
anime,not_removed,fune wo amu sounds really interesting theres another added to the list flip flappers is looking adorable as always that art styles fantastic keijos gonna be good hopefully im intrigued by mahou shoujo ikusei keikakus description
anime,not_removed,nyanbo i love yotsuba read it after azumamga daioh however i think i remember the author saying yotsubas comedy wouldnt be the same in anime format and that he didnt really want an anime waiting to see how thisll turn out
anime,not_removed,every single season i tell myself im gonna watch less anime and i somehow end up watching more although i dont think it will happen with this season it might still somehow happen
anime,not_removed,drifters premise sound really interesting akin to fatezero to the ones who read the manga is it any good how much of history do they actually explore
anime,not_removed,well looks like its just gonna be yuri on ice gundam ibo for me next season
anime,not_removed,my thoughts on what interests me nyanbo i i never knew that this was a thing touken ranbu i actually sighed when i saw the shinsengumi jacket thinking that it was another swordsmen show but then i picked up when i read that it is a show about time travelling police long riders you want to make a show with lots of beautiful scenery you make a show about long distance cycling of course im only guessing as to whether this show will have good backgrounds but i like these sorts of life dramas anyway drifters anime deadliest warriors will probably suck but that wont matter if it has great fight scenes shuumatsu no izetta in she soars over the battlefield i see so its gay wonder woman the tv series nazotokine i need this to fill the niche that no game no life left behind bikini warriors ova i thought bw would suck like queens blade but it made fun of rpg tropes and was pretty good lets see if it can keep the humour in fulllength episodes
anime,not_removed,so theres a few im interested in euphonium girlish number mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku udon no kuni no kiniro kemari im also interested in red turtle seeing as ghibli havent released anything for while though i dont know how soon ill be able to watch it
anime,not_removed,this season is heavy on the sequels and since i made a promise to myself ill be watching any sports sequels andor spinoffs etc haikyuu bungou stray dogs okusama hibike ajin wixoss brave witches and maybe gundam ibo if i can get to finishing the first season beforehand sports haikyuu listed above all out keijo yuri on ice long riders and tiger mask x oh and days will be continuing with all of that alone my season is already looking pretty full aside from those im most excited for kiss him not me no lion udon no kuni and shuumatsu no izetta i might throw in another couple series depending on how the days lay out once dates are out but thats about it from a quick skim through not a ton of hype overall but i usually find it difficult to get super hyped over sequels even when its a show i loved because theyre something id watch anyway and since i made a promise to myself to watch any and all sports this season im feeling a similar effect there even though theres some great looking sports sweies im looking forward to it regardless
anime,not_removed,i cant wait for more ajin so we can get more maximum thrill
anime,not_removed,as much as enjoy doga kobo cgdct anime seeing them take a break to do time travelling samurai comedy with should be good if only for doga kobo animated sword fights a lot of people are saying theres nothing good but theres loads im intrigued by hibike drifters girlish number kiss him not me and march comes in like a lion classicaloid looks insane with keijo and my wife is a student council president filling in the ecchi comedy slots also some great ovas on the way oregairu mon musu non non biyori overlord sakamoto niijiro days and that magus bride series hopefully the fansubbers will able to do them quickly and then theres koe no katachi which im holding a tiny hope gets some form of uk cinema release
anime,not_removed,wait theres a magical girl highlander hunger games anime
anime,not_removed,haikyuu all out yuri on ice and long riders have me hyped enough on their own hypeoverload
anime,not_removed,iron blooded orphans hype
anime,not_removed,loads of sports this season cant wait for haikyuu
anime,not_removed,show by rock anyone
anime,not_removed,dreamfes utapri i am idol trash rn
anime,not_removed,that synopsis for mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku immediately made me think of jan quadrant vincent excuse me nurse can you take my temperature because i think ive got mahou district ikusei fever uh over here
anime,not_removed,that long riders anime is deeply disturbing to me what kind of sick twisted individual sees a folding bike and thinks its cool theyre not cool theyre abominations anyways heres the most important thing on that entire image
anime,not_removed,looks like a pretty shitty season
anime,not_removed,this list doesnt really look as good as this season i was looking at shows this summer dropped to excluding rezero and theres no hype leftover like rezero im looking forward to hibike loved girlish numberby watari author of oregairu wixoss enjoyed the original series shuumatsu wwii era and possible yuri
anime,not_removed,is it just me or this fall season seems to be really lackluster
anime,not_removed,mostly hyped for and
anime,not_removed,really looking forward to flip flappers seems interesting so far and yuri on ice should be pretty good based on the people behind it couple that with natsumehaikyuu hype and its a solid lineup so far looking forward to it ugh at more wixoss though
anime,not_removed,name show yuri on ice male cast japan is weird
anime,not_removed,haikyuu ibo and hibike hypeeee
anime,not_removed,seems like a weak season for me which is a first im only hyped for drifters haikyuu classicaloid and digimon tri im interested in checking some others out but no expectations
anime,not_removed,didnt think thered be anything weaker than the current season but looks like ill be only watching one show ajin next season
anime,not_removed,i sense the lack of moe solseems im gonna suffer next season hopefully it wont be as bad as winter though will definitely check stella no mahou girlish number long riders udon no kuni might check digimon universe appli monster idol memories sangatsu no lion first time i have literally zero hype for a season o hope therell be interesting suprise show later
anime,not_removed,there are some plots that look really interesting a bunch of sequels that i should need to watch first but nothing too notable therell probably be a bunch of sleeper hits i think
anime,not_removed,oh fuck the new tiger mask show is coming out i hope there are cameos from njpw stars like it was rumored
anime,not_removed,sunrise doing an anime original comedy you have my attention i didnt finish either but im a bit surprised that bungou stray dogs and ajin god second seasons were those more popular than they appeared on ranime
anime,not_removed,well there is enough interesting ones for me so far lets see how they go if all else fails ill be able to catch up on my ptw list trickster touken ranbu drifters shuumatsu no izetta love my military historicals mahou shoujo murderous magical girls count me in luger code nanbaka bungou stray dogs
anime,not_removed,i will definitely go with long riders just a cycling fan
anime,not_removed,i doubletapped to zoom in and was overwhelmed
anime,not_removed,a movie of koi no tachi
anime,not_removed,this will give me a chance to catch up on the overwhelming list of anime on my plan to watch with not too much coming out this fall
anime,not_removed,hibike and gundam are the only things that jumped out at me here
anime,not_removed,essentially no interest in any shows and interest in two or three movies not much different than most seasons for me i suppose
anime,not_removed,first time i see almost nothing interesting okusama hibike drifters keijo kancolle movie ovas and regalia which already had episodes this season
anime,not_removed,i remember seeing a trailer for drifters at the end of helping ultimate looked really cool as it brought many historical figures together to do battle
anime,not_removed,tfw rezero isnt on the list
anime,not_removed,i thought saekano was coming out this season
anime,not_removed,haikyuu bungou stray dogs iron orphans ajin kurokos movies nice all outrugby anime if you are into sports could be decent i dont read manga though so i dont know what the material is like
anime,not_removed,shuumatsu no izetta that trailer what in blazes count me in thats fantastic
anime,not_removed,this the full line up
anime,not_removed,have no idea what to watch next season at all s
anime,not_removed,waiting for ajin gundam ibo and shuumatsu no izetta
anime,not_removed,the plots of the shows looks vague and i dont find it interesting but will still watch it to see what it has to offer
anime,not_removed,did anyone spot the seasonal battle harem my harem sensors are failing me
anime,not_removed,keijo fanservice the anime
anime,not_removed,bunch of sequels from which i didnt watch the first series to begin with fall will be the time to clean up my backlog
anime,not_removed,good thing i was planning on not watching much anime that season because i will have little time with a fulltime internship only saw about shows that i am like yeah i will watch and almost all of them are originals or sequels
anime,not_removed,this is definitely the season i was looking forward to the most this season all out hibike euphonium second season my wife is the student council president season keijo monster musume pool oad kuroko no basket recap movies
anime,not_removed,hibike euphonium season two the dream
anime,not_removed,well i havent seen or heard of pretty much a single one of these which ones should i watch brb reading comments
anime,not_removed,seems pretty weak to be honest the only nonsequel that caught my eye was drifters
anime,not_removed,bbut didnt they say prison school will be fall this year
anime,not_removed,yet again the synopsis blurbs say little to me since i dont follow manga and ln scenes maybe its better i wont get too hyped and then disappointed that said there are few shows that have interesting premises and im going to check them out luger code – werewolves at war with humans sounds interesting stella no mahou – another cgdct show with an interesting promise by the director of non non biyori and the writer of non non biyori watashi ga motete dousunda – this looks like kind like reversed im the main character of a harem manga but im gay so every day is hell for me so its a mustsee for me gakuen handsome – this looks so dumb i have to check it out also i need to see what the inspiration for senpai club was like flip flappers – i mean i kinda lied about having premises this show has brilliant artstyle and thats the only reason im interested in it there are also few shows ill wait for peoples opinions after three episodes since i dont want to start things only to drop them trickster edogawa ranpo shounen tanteidan yori – the mysterious immortal person trope gave us code geass but it also gave us big order drifters – battle royale after being transported to another world again at least with fewer teenagers this time nobunaga no shinobi – a historical comedy most likely a short it might be good it might be bad it might be culturally unlocalisable chis sweet home – i dropped season but if they go back to what made season great and it might be okay
anime,not_removed,im watching girlish number only because wataru watari is creator who also created oregairu
anime,not_removed,kinda weird that theyre putting the red turtle as a ghibli movie since they barely did anything on the movie either way go see it its great
anime,not_removed,o this is interesting normally id recognize atleast half of the upcoming anime from having tried the source material but this season i only recognize thats an extremely large amount of original lessknown source material adaptations quite excited
anime,not_removed,lot of idol stuff this season
anime,not_removed,long riders kind of has me interested biking is certainly common in japan but for an entire series to be focused on it albeit in a sportscompetition setting not just biking around town is surprising it wouldnt be the first anime that focused on a seemingly mundane subject and sometimes they turn out to be fun
anime,not_removed,mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku sounds fucking cool actually i might give it a try
anime,not_removed,wait a drifters anime does the manga have enough material for an anime last time ive checked it was nowhere near a conclusion and we basically had no idea what was going on
anime,not_removed,thats a lot of sequels personally im kind of thankful since my ptw isnt going to rise up again like the last two season as its way big as it is ill probably only pick up kiss him not me watashi ga motete dosunda since i havent watched the first seasons of most of the others i would watch hibike haikyuu wixoss and im a fan of reverse harems sangatsu no lion is the only other thing i might be interested in otherwise although the setting im not so familiar with the rules of shogi although i heard its similar to chess koe no katachi probably will be unwatchable until bd releases so people can sub it or crfunisomeone somehow manages to get their hands on it early and sub it themselves
anime,not_removed,they really went all out with the ass on their poster nice
anime,not_removed,few worthwhile sequels but nothing interesting really
anime,not_removed,idols and magical girls everywhere mahou shouju ikusei keikaru seems brutal might pick up drifters as well def going to watch the gundam maybe digimon
anime,not_removed,the werewolf one and drifters i am quite interested everything else meh that said there are few that i will check just for the sake of probably discovering something i hope that i can at least find anime to watch this season
anime,not_removed,so i guess not much plays the game looking forward for mh stories even if its a different tale i too want to ride on a monster particularly kirin keijo well tits and asses tourney nice show by rock i hope they animated those instruments well
anime,not_removed,at first i was thinking it seemed pretty weak since only or looked interesting but then i remembered that i probably wont even have enough time to watch that many
anime,not_removed,no one else interested in that wresting anime tiger mask also while luger code looks like its gonna be crap its plot is a hallmark to the nazi plans for a guerilla resistance known as the werewolves
anime,not_removed,haikyuu and touken ranbu
anime,not_removed,calling it now weakest season of the only decent shows are all sequels namely haikyuu natsume and hibike euphonium i think this is probably the weakest impression for a season ive ever had guess its time to finally address that gintama backlog edit sorry didnt mention koe no katachi easy choice for newest show to enter mal top might even enter the coveted territory that movie is gonna be the bomb
anime,not_removed,euphonium its more euphonium idol memories idols thats it time bokan time traveling and a weird ass history alright lets go magickyun renaissance i always want to give originals a shot even when they sound cheesy as fuck shuumatsu no izetta looks like yuri and i am a simple man yuri on ice looks like yuri that i dont like but ill probably watch it anyway sangatsu no lion ooh something by shaft that isnt monogatari ill take it vivid strike made by the nanoha creator expecting magical girl badassery is that an iroha ova i see
anime,not_removed,i admit this season is lackluster at first glance but theres still a lot of hope for decent shows drifter lugar code vivid strike shuumatsu no izetta in particular i have no clue about all the other anime or im not into the genres so ill have to hear from people whove seen the source material or watched them before giving anything else a try
anime,not_removed,second seasons for days all outs lol so far im definitely watching these fune wo amu udon no kuni no kiniro kemari yuri on ice drifters shuumatsu no izetta natsume yuujinchou go classicaloid sangatsu no lion nanbaka anyway forget about all that im not missing keijo for anything
anime,not_removed,nothing really catches my attention i guess this is a backlog season for me god knows thats been piling up
anime,not_removed,doesnt look like a very strong season but then again we get another season of natsume and we get drifters oh and hibike will be a nice watch
anime,not_removed,no harem but just inverse harem i need my generic stuff man or ill have the tingles at least we have the pervy students council president
anime,not_removed,apart from the sequels im pretty excited for all out finally a group of dudes who dont skip leg day
anime,not_removed,my first impressions holy shit monster hunter with david production sign me the f up more ajin is good didnt watch until it finished might do that again gakuen handsome since when did kaiji get a high school spinoff holy shit flip flappers next season yes and hibike yes and yuri on ice yes and sangatsu no lion yes and haikyu holy fuck yes damn quite a few good movies coming out too planetarian would be so much better in a movie format vs ona koe no katachi the red turtle and ajin sequel to be hyped for yeah next season is going to be terrible s
anime,not_removed,most likely going to watch the full show brave witches hibike euphonium keijo stella no mahou vivid strike episode rule no lion flip flappers girlish number idol memories long riders mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku nazotokine show by rock shuumatsu no izetta soul buster soushin shoujo matoi
anime,not_removed,nyanbo is probably the closest well ever get to a yotsuba anime
anime,not_removed,fuck yeah bungou stray dogs season
anime,not_removed,still no mo no no ke sequel damnit
anime,not_removed,wixoss
anime,not_removed,drifters and vivid strike are the sure thing for me guess ill check the other magical girl shows and check the sub for the rest of stuff i should be watching
anime,not_removed,i dont feel very excited for this season but i will probably be surprised by what it has to offer it is hard to top the awesomeness that came out in spring
anime,not_removed,whats up with the sudden influx of shows featuring edogawa ranpos works recently it feels like weve been getting at least one based off of himhis works each season now cant wait for the kagepro movie hope sidu does a good job in his first directing role
anime,not_removed,udon no kuni no kiniro kemari looks to be right up my alley so im excited for that hibike euphonium will be ridiculously beautiful and just an absolute treat to watch natsume yuujinchou go reminds me that i need to finish whats aired so far so i can watch it week to week this time and then ill be hitting most of the rest to see whats what the three i mentioned were just what immediately stood out for me ps theres nothing that excites me more than koe no katachi i loved the manga and i cant wait to finally see that story in motionwhich will be beautiful since its kyoto
anime,not_removed,fuckin david pro on monster hunter yoooo
anime,not_removed,holy shit tiger mask
anime,not_removed,hyped for keijo and okusama ga seitokaichou ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
anime,not_removed,rofl when im more hyped about the ovas than the animes xd
anime,not_removed,all out looks interesting aint seen a rubgy anime before
anime,not_removed,the only thing im sure to watch with this list is gundam ibo
anime,not_removed,the nextseason will probably be quality over quantity at least i hope so probably not gonna watch as much as this season but i am hyped for all out drifters haikyuu season luger code nanbaka sangatsu no lion do i need to know shōgi to watch sangatsu no lion there are also a lot of others i will check out but i think the ones above would be the ones i personally would enjoy the most
anime,not_removed,as someone who loves madoka magica ill definitely have to check out mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku that one to me seems like the most interesting show this season that isnt a sequel
anime,not_removed,well i dont see a single thing i know of i guess i get another season to work on my list although lately im more working on my games list
anime,not_removed,so what non sequel series should i watch
anime,not_removed,so were getting a danboinspired anime but still no yotsuba anime
anime,not_removed,wow only ajin gundam and wixoss what a slow season
anime,not_removed,a lot of originals this upcoming seasoni like that definitely looking forward to bungou stray dogs hibike euphonium okusama and iron blooded orphans
anime,not_removed,stray dogs and ajin hype
anime,not_removed,welp only shows that interest me so far are haikyuu sangatsu no lion natsume yuujinchou for once im more hyped for the movies and ovas that are coming out like mahoutsukai no yome still salty that this isnt a episode series oregairu best girl date hype koe no katachi was disappointed at first that it wont be a full episode series but now i realize that movie format might be better for this
anime,not_removed,how does digital frontier usually handles the release of its moviesin this case gantzo straight to tv or cinema the teaser was so damn beautiful and the fact that they also handled one of my favourite animated movies wolf children will inevitably make me cry again
anime,not_removed,girlish number dream festival nyanbo all seem really cool might check it out mostly because the art for girlish number and dream festival caught my eye also nyanbo looks pretty funny hyped for sangatsu no lion and oregairu ova lets gooooooooooooo oh and hibiki how could i forgot pls forgive me
anime,not_removed,tiger mask show has potential for the few wrestling fans like me i even heard it has actual njpw guys in small roles
anime,not_removed,we finally get a monster hunter anime and its based off the chibi version of the series
anime,not_removed,sadly there doesnt seem to be much for me this fall maybe mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku sounds a bit like mirai nikki or any other battle royal feat madoka
anime,not_removed,nanbaka girlish number and fune wo amu definitely caught my interest drifters could be good as well
anime,not_removed,happy about all the shows coming out that are originals i tend to like originals best sick of everything being based off light novels so much female pandering o what a world
anime,not_removed,as a rugby player i am stupid excited for all out ive been asking for this for years heres hoping it goes well
anime,not_removed,magical girl raising project sounds really my thing killing game magical girls sign me up lerche has immensely impressed me with how theyre handling dangan ronpa compared to so i have faith
anime,not_removed,theyre making a monster hunter anime and why did they go with this super clicheeboring premise a monster hunter anime that would just show a group of hunters going from newbies to badasses like in the actual game would have been really cool
anime,not_removed,flip flappers wooot
anime,not_removed,drifters is made by the same guy who did hellsing
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,looks a bit light drifters will be getting a look as will all out i still havent seen the first season of ajin the season of which will show up on netflix next winter i guess but im defintely watching bungou stray dogs i still dont know if i wanna watch more iron blood orphans cuz its not thunderbolt maybe if whatsherface doesnt come back
anime,not_removed,i had no idea touken ranbu was getting a sol spinoff
anime,not_removed,you know how is musaigen phantom world doing
anime,not_removed,the only anime i might watch is haikyuu and thats because i read the manga a long time ago and put it on hold around that part
anime,not_removed,what the hell wheres all the high school harem romance comedies not gonna watch fall season
anime,not_removed,natsumeeeeeeee d
anime,not_removed,theres an anime based on a cat version of danbo but no real yotsuba anime why
anime,not_removed,more kuroko hype
anime,not_removed,impressively this is the season with the most magical girl shows airing at the same time even if you dont count mecha musume it still beats any other season in history not coincidentally the whole genre is turning years old this december with sally the witchs anniversary
anime,not_removed,holy shit koe no katachi is getting an adaption
anime,not_removed,this looks disappointing
anime,not_removed,i was so hoping that id see owarimonogatari on this chart
anime,not_removed,hm is it just me or is there quite a bit more sports and fujobait shows than usual here anyway the ones im looking forward togoing to give a try udon no kuni no kiniro kemari slice of life with a splash of fantasy and not about highschoolers sounds nice flip flappers sounds like it might be fun might just be trash ill give it a chance drifters ton of warriors duking it out in valhalla sounds like some fun action shuumatsu no izetta magical girls in wwii or something ill keep an eye on it see if it seems interesting once more info is around mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku to be blunt this really just sounds like someone looked at madoka and thought huh dark magical girl show is successful let me make one with all the edge ill give it a chance but my expectations arent great vivid strike time for some befriending gundam ibo
anime,not_removed,its a pretty dull season when i cant make a top without including the ovamovie section for the curious hibike euphonium koe no katachi oregairu ova no i havent watched natsume yuujinchou and haikyuu the first is on my backlog and ill probably never watch the second because i dont care much about sports shows maybe ill check out that lion thing if it gets praised at least this seasonll give me plenty of time to cut my backlog down a bit
anime,not_removed,ah only two for me this time natsume yuujinchou haikyuu
anime,not_removed,one or two things otherwise not impressed
anime,not_removed,most of what im excited for are sequels ajin euphonium bungou stray dogs show by rock wixoss and natsume yuujinchou all returning also and okusama but those two can go fuck off id rather not make a huge list of everything else im watching on a side note is tiger mask w a sequel ie do you have to watch the original tiger mask anime in order to get whats happening in this one
anime,not_removed,could anyone tell me if the kuroko no basket movies are recaps or new content
anime,not_removed,regalia the three sacred stars trickster edogawa ranpo shounen tanteidan yori digimon universe appli monsters shuumatsu no izetta girlish number vivid strike sangatsu no lion luger code udon no kuni no kiniro kemari got these so far willing to pick up more originals and none of the others really caught my attention not really a fan of sports anime or most music anime until they make a hockey anime then ill be all over that shit
anime,not_removed,drifters and gantzothats going to be fucking amazing lets hope gantzo becomes a success so we might get a real anime of it in the future
anime,not_removed,natsume yuujinchou and a second season of ajin nice
anime,not_removed,super excited for sangatsu no lion hadnt heard anything about it before checking this chart out but ive been dying for a chess anime so this is the next best thing plus i love characterdriven stuff also looking forward to yuri on ice the pv is beautifully animated and reminds me of the stunning ice skating scene from death parade
anime,not_removed,haikyuu is the anime ive most looking forward to
anime,not_removed,i seriously hope vivid strike is good after all the controversy with vivid im honestly afraid the nanoha franchise may outright die if its not successfulnot the whole franchise ofc just the anime portion strikers is my favorite part of the franchise so theres some hope but as its anime original it can so easily be a trainwreck and we currently know basically nothing about it please be successfuli want to believe theres still some hope of a third movie
anime,not_removed,i swear i only watch it for the plot prelenny
anime,not_removed,i feel like maybe kingsglaive should be on here
anime,not_removed,just goes to show that peoples hype is based on what series they know is getting an adaptation not enough known adaptations and more original series omg this season sucks
anime,not_removed,definite hibike show by rock will give a look all out always up for sports anime touken ranbu long riders shuumatsu no izetta drifters tiger mask w luger code another period setting im down bold titles will be ones ill probably get into first after the two definite titles
anime,not_removed,only like decentish mecha title another disappointing season
anime,not_removed,huh more ajin also that drifters thing is finally comming out nifty
anime,not_removed,aside from getting more wixoss witches vivid and lolirobots theres quite a few things that seems worth checking out flip flappers sounds great two girls one magical adventure sign me up keijo definitely looks interesting weird sports and girls is a good combo ss matoi sounds like typical maho shoujo stuff which unfortunately means it will probably try to go full madoka grimderp bullshit time bokan have a chance to be a good comedy dank memes about history ms ikusei keikaku means plan i will give it a try tho this kind of battle royale stuff was never my thing this has cute girls thats all what matters girlish number sounds like new game of the fall luger code sounds like what which makes me want to give it a chance and long riders sounds like actas will be making two anime at once get ready for more delays bois
anime,not_removed,wow there is nothing interestingand whats up with all the girly shows
anime,not_removed,oh look its regalia it would be even funnier if we end up seeing regalia rebooted on the winter list as well anyways lets see im interested in trickster nanbaka nazotokine and mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku
anime,not_removed,weak season airing on tv that interest me shuumatsu no izetta drifters movies will be released with subs in anyways koe no katachi planetarian ovasspecials overlord oregairu sakamoto monmusu
anime,not_removed,so ready for more hibike i need another compilation of looks to be around shows ill check out lighter than this season for sure
anime,not_removed,fune wo amu sounds like it will be the most interesting new show ill watch continuations like hibike and haikyuu but thatll probably be the only new show i pick up
anime,not_removed,ill check hibike but sangatsu no lion and okusama ga seitokaichou are the ones i know of for sure ill be seeing ill pick up more stuff as i see it but for now itllbe hard to fins something beter than okusama
anime,not_removed,and hibike otherwise meeeeh
anime,not_removed,a lot of sequels to shows i disliked or have no interest in
anime,not_removed,i want to know more about shumatsu no izetta it looks interesting other than that ill surely watch hibike and sangatsu no lion edit ok i dont know what to think about this of izetta
anime,not_removed,i have my yuri goggles ready for at least shows
anime,not_removed,monster hunter stories ride on does anyone know what kind of show this is gonna be i think ive heard rumor that the stories part means that itll be more directed towards kids tiger mask w will i have to have seen or read any previous tiger mask for this one the synopsis makes it sound mostly standalone but hopefully there are tiger mask fans here that can help
anime,not_removed,where the fuck are my battle school haremssaid noone ever
anime,not_removed,its shaping up to be a really solid season definitely watching haikyuu koe no katachi drifters yuri on ice gintama special ova nanbaka tentatively interested fune wo amu all out udon no kuni no kiniro kemari shuumatsu no izetta touken ranbu hanamaru classicaloid sangatsu no lion tiger mask w
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,honestly after reading the synopses of many original shows i have written them off already art is magic classicaloid whatever the fuck is this vr idols history is actually not what it is werewolves really it all sounds like trash in my opinion but there are a few im looking forward to flip flappers trickster shuumatsu no izetta girlish number shoushin shoujo matoi all sound not terrible and i guess were all waiting for yuri on ice and by heavens i hope vivid strike is not going to suck i have a massive boner for magical girls hand to hand combat adaptations of all out and drifers fucking hype stella no mahou no lion long riders soul buster magical girls keikaku im willing to give you a go touken ranbu too since all i know about it comes from hentai ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° keijo is either going to be shit or best show ever im actually hyped after watching the pv kiss him not me what the fuck haha picked up haikyuu hibike and wixoss already make the season good for me either way so im not going to complain
anime,not_removed,omg this is gonna be a great season sports animes this seasonam i dreaming im excited for drifters too
anime,not_removed,seems like it will be another shit season
anime,not_removed,this season looks lame
anime,not_removed,only two animes i going to watch sad i never had such an empty season since i started watching anime in
anime,not_removed,only good anime on this list the rest looks like its loli fanservice for the pedophiles
anime,not_removed,i finished vol last night cant wait to see this animated and the fact thats its going to be episodes is just wonderful honey clover is one of my all time favorites
anime,not_removed,deleted
anime,not_removed,just curiousnot to say it cant be good because it has obviously gotten quite a bit of accolade but how well does it perform in terms of bringing new things to the very common depressed traumatized guy meets quirkyhappy girl narrative
anime,not_removed,you forgot about op by bump of chicken
anime,not_removed,like honey and clover its very slow so id advise people planning to watch it to give it more than episodes before dropping
anime,not_removed,yeah im amazed how underhyped this show is the manga was excellent
anime,not_removed,i hope this means that shuka will continue to pick up unfinished brains base adaptions any of baccano spice and wolf or bokura wa minna kawaisou would be great but all would be amazing that is assuming they could pull it off well
anime,not_removed,natsume has some of the most heartbreaking episodic stories i have ever seen in anime really touching story of connecting with lost loved ones it really permeates the entire story
anime,not_removed,can hardly contain the hype when i heard there was a new season i thought we would be waiting years
anime,not_removed,im so freaking hyped for natsume cant wait for my of relaxation every week
anime,not_removed,i would check out gatsu lion as well
anime,not_removed,i think all out is gonna be a good show imo
anime,not_removed,psyched for more natusume checking out hibike because you have haikyuu on there as well
anime,not_removed,i mean im super excited for drifters i mean a new anime that was written and illustrated by kouta hirano the creator of hellsing i am sooo ready
anime,not_removed,the premise sounds ridiculous enough to give it at least episodes worth of a watch
anime,not_removed,having read the manga its pretty good not a lot of amazing stuff next season but gonna watch this
anime,not_removed,from what ive read of the manga about chapters its a pretty solid comedy with very endearingly eccentric characters id compare it to tanakakun but this is a bit more gloriously irreverent in its comedy and the main girl is a delight to see as shes somewhat refreshing from the usual shoujo protagonists we get
anime,not_removed,i read the manga its pretty fun im honestly excited
anime,not_removed,this sounds hilarious
anime,not_removed,the summary alone was a journey
anime,not_removed,from what i hear from the manga readers its beginning is pretty good but it degrades rather quickly the deeper you get into its content
anime,not_removed,cmon cr pick this up im counting on you
anime,not_removed,im addicted to the recent trend of unusual protagonist in high school attracts people and hilarity ensues like sakamoto and tanakakun so im definitely looking forward to it hell this season alone has of them namely mob psycho not exactly what im talking about but it has the same aspect saiki kusuo handakun and the fudanshi shorts
anime,not_removed,i read some of the manga but it wasnt really geared towards me so i dropped it that being said its a really interesting concept and im glad its finally getting an adaptation even though i wont be watching it
anime,not_removed,its much better than you think having read the manga and allymmv some might take issue with the first episode but will be fine afterwards
anime,not_removed,ajin is pretty great dont let the animation turn you away if you have crunchyroll and enjoy manga i would suggest reading it as well
anime,not_removed,ajin starts out rough and progresses into something really interesting
anime,not_removed,haikyuu is very easy to marathon i marathoned the whole thing in a week
anime,not_removed,just keep in mind that the first season of natsume is still images i dont think ive ever seen a series that good get a budget that bad you should watch it alongside hibike for maximum impact
anime,not_removed,have they released the areas that get screenings will it even leave japan i need knk asap
anime,not_removed,its probably the lack of a clear toptier anime adaptation which gets hyped up to be aots or whatever it happened last winter and it turned out fine anyway plus theres a lot of great shows this season which may have shifted expectations oh and everyone here seems to like being all negative when it comes to any given season of anime every single season seems to get called weak here hopefully itll be better when it actually starts airing
anime,not_removed,kind of baffling me how people can write a season off as bland or weak when theyve seen zero minutes of airtime
anime,not_removed,but then they and the next second theyre all saying that a season is lackluster or not very hype since they dont recognize anything on the list ive counted original anime that are coming out next season so if this isnt the season for anime writters and directors to show what theyve got then i dont really know when else theyll be able to do it also i know that no one is saying that itll necessarily be a bad season but the mood in the comment section definitely isnt helping the thought i dont see much of anything that intrigues me though i am usually a sucker for original anime but everything just looks bland i am not a sportsmecha anime person and that makes this season look weak as fuck to me we have had a lot of original heavy seasons with great shows this doesnt look to be one of them art direction look very generic even the og shows and the setting are tooi guess normal no whacky shit all of them look like shows to me i would love to be proved wrong though a big factor might also be just how strong the current season is
anime,not_removed,its as if there there are people with different beliefs and each time theres something they dont like they speak out
anime,not_removed,writers
anime,not_removed,they remind me of a friend who always votes third party in every election that way i win no matter what i always have a valid reason to complain
anime,not_removed,of the original series only a minority are watchable as the majority are just typical otaku or fujoshi pandering bs
anime,not_removed,one minute people complain and there you have it the internet in a nutshell thats all you have to understand
anime,not_removed,i agree but i also see where a lot of people are coming from because most of the new original anime next season dont look very promising or look generic but with original anime you never know so heres hoping a lot will turn out good
anime,not_removed,im happy i got iron blooded orphans ans stray dogs maybe striker may trike a cord in me but as you said yea there is a lot of originals but most of em seems like weak ecchimusicsport wierd stuff the only music anime i like was cantabile because there wasnt a love interest shoehorned in it it developped anyway ill quit my rambling and i feel like the next season is like this one and rather ok not the best season with anime im hype but still good
anime,not_removed,i think the word that is missing is unique sure there could be some good shows in the fall season but will they be rememorable i dont think so give us something that hasnt been recycled a thousand times already with a random keyword thrown in to call it original and we will be happy if i remember the anime after x years it was a good anime this season currently does not look like anything special to add to that list but i will reserve my judgement till i see them
anime,not_removed,yeah but most of those original anime look like shit
anime,not_removed,i think its just because people have no idea how an anime original will be if there is source material then they have an idea of the popularity andor quality of the series but with anime original you get a brief synopsis and then you have no idea so people will need to wait till they start airing and find out whats good then
anime,not_removed,its cool that its original content but it still doesnt seem like that strong of a season to me
anime,not_removed,original series can be greatwhen theyre not all fujobait garbage
anime,not_removed,completely agreed i am sure these are the same people who fell in love with shows like rezero or erased as the season starts ur gonna see some of these new shows get really hyped up u cant just say the season is weak by looking at summaries also imo it looks as good as summer drifters was the original attack on titan clone before kabaneri the manga has done decently all outs looks really promising and its freakin madhouse many good sequels and lots of originals to me fall looks decent enough not like spring where we had jojoboku no herorezero etc but still good it might even surpass springsummer if the originals are good
anime,not_removed,i dont understand people who generalize whole communities as though they are a single entity the reason you see this happen is because the community is more than one person meaning you have people with differing opinions so when one half is happy the other is not people generally complain more than they praise things so you end up seeing half the community bitch while the other half stays silent no matter what happens its the same for any large community
anime,not_removed,this is the second greatest pv i have ever seen
anime,not_removed,and its made by the studio that brought us to loveru thats how you know this is aoty
anime,not_removed,it being in english made it just that much better so they fight with their booty and boobs just when i think ive seen it all
anime,not_removed,what the fuck
anime,not_removed,my body my body is probably not ready not for this
anime,not_removed,right when i saw xebeci knew it was gonna be something stupid
anime,not_removed,its like xebec arent even trying to hide the fact that they want to rely solely on fanservice anymore sigh im in demolition d was right
anime,not_removed,i dont even like ecchi usually but im watching the fuck outta this glorious series concealedexcitement
anime,not_removed,oh
anime,not_removed,girls in bikinis more or less and deep storyline
anime,not_removed,this is on uma musume anime fucking when level of awesome its going to be the best show ever right
anime,not_removed,now i am too
anime,not_removed,finally a sexy swimsuit based show eons after umisho i just hope animation quality is good
anime,not_removed,fuck me im sold that animation looks on point
anime,not_removed,that trailer timed perfectly with mollys lips by nirvana was weird
anime,not_removed,i thought you were just being really excited about that show due to all those exclamation marks but no really is the title anyways i am interested in watching this show once it is finished airing it also kinda gives off a bit of the same vibe as which is one of my favorite shows
anime,not_removed,well my favourite anime evur is weird sport anime that starts with cute girls in a tank that instead of camouflage is just fully golden and sparkles like edward cullen im not going to dismiss keijo just because it doesnt sound like real sport
anime,not_removed,extremity of the fanservice takes a massive dive noooooooo
anime,not_removed,so sorta like shokugeki then
anime,not_removed,the ecchi really does take a backseat in this series i fail to see how a show about boobass sumo is going to have less ecchi but it seems interesting
anime,not_removed,this sounds like my straight up guilty pleasure for the fall season totally looking forward to it
anime,not_removed,extremity of the fanservice takes a massive dive actually im pretty sure thats when a majority of its viewerbase dies unless its actually extremely good i dont think people are gonna stick around for the shounen sports although thats just my opinion
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,damn it i said i wasnt gonna watch so much anime next season trollarcher
anime,not_removed,it doesnt focus on shougi much the most in depth description you will ever get will be from a childrens book one of the characters writes its a much more character driven show with that being said though i love the manga and would highly recommend checking out this show when it airs
anime,not_removed,that was more amusing than i want to admit
anime,not_removed,haikyuu and hibike hype
anime,not_removed,hibike hype koe no katachi hype
anime,not_removed,iron blooded orphans
anime,not_removed,yeah i can see like things total that i would watch and only are tv series
anime,not_removed,just ajin for me though im sure lots of people are looking forward to haikyuu
anime,not_removed,also i got hopes for nazotokine
anime,not_removed,this is the first time that none of the manga i read are getting an adaptation and nothing else looks super interesting i can realistically see myself watching no new anime this season time to polish off the ol ptw then
anime,not_removed,i take seasons like this as a chance to catch up on shows i have put off or missed
anime,not_removed,good time to hit the backlog then
anime,not_removed,well drifters is pretty amazing on top of that mahou tsukai no yome ova and the koe no katachi movie
anime,not_removed,theres a couple of good sequels coming out but as far as stand alone shows that anyone can pick up it seems a little bleak booty fights seems like it might be the hypest thing so far
anime,not_removed,new series wise i agree
anime,not_removed,give a try manga is a for me and with pretty solid studio cast and director
anime,not_removed,wut its looking like itll blow at least the winter and spring seasons this year out of the water andll probably beat summer too like weve got tons of big sequels with things like natsume yuujinchou haikyuu hibike euphonium and ibo among others for new stuff no surprises there since its mappa concept sounds ridiculously hilarious it even has beethoven voiced by sugita theres a with madhouse as the studio no less we finally get an adaptation of and its even cours theres also the very interesting choice in studio director to look forward to in and of itself plus plenty of other things with potential like fune wo amu nanbaka udon no kuni izetta watashi ga motete dousunda drifters theres tons to look forward to this fall season
anime,not_removed,the only interesting thing about the fall season is probably cour of many series such as gundamibo haikyuu and hibike its been coming for quite awhile now these past few seasons have been constantly churning out pretty good anime so it is bound to be sooner or later that a poor season comes out
anime,not_removed,yeah definitely looks weak compared to summer
anime,not_removed,with gundam ibo hibike euphonium and bungou stray dogs i dont see how this season is weak
anime,not_removed,a few sequels but thats about it really nothing eye catching at all
anime,not_removed,the only thing its really lacking is some hyped battle shounen other than this itll be a great season also look at those butts from all out and long rider if we add haikyuu than we get a great season for sports anime
anime,not_removed,im not totally hyped about any of them but many seem interesting to me and they might end up being awesome i guess ill see trickster seems like it has an interesting mystery based on the synopsis monster hunter stories could be a fun fantasy adventure or can be very generic and bland ill wait to see some reviews before watching it fune wo amu can be nice if its a lighthearted slice of life without too much drama in it i like that its not about teenagers time bokan because i love adventure stories about time travel udon no kuni no kiniro kemari looks like a lighthearted slice of life show with added mystery and a nonteenager protagonist sounds great to me flip flappers because i love adventure stories about other dimensions touken ranbu could be a fun time travel adventure too watashi ga motete dousunda could be hilarious it reminds me of enthusiastic shippers on the internet
anime,not_removed,someone says this every season
anime,not_removed,how could you not hyped for more okusama ga seitokaichou
anime,not_removed,idk man im pretty hyped for drifters
anime,not_removed,yea aside from natsume yuujinchou which will be incredible theres really nothing im interested in so far
anime,not_removed,its like half idol shows
anime,not_removed,okusama ga seitokaichou hype i am stupidly excited for this show me too i have been waiting for it since it was announced the mix of ecchi and cute is just great
anime,not_removed,i cant wait to commentate on a strike witches anime it has been too long
anime,not_removed,if youre a sports anime fan you wont regret finishing up haijyuu before the season
anime,not_removed,luger code is based on a chapters manga by the artist of medaka box i found it okay
anime,not_removed,keijo has a lot in common with hajime no ippo and shokugeki no souma
anime,not_removed,your sequel list has a distinct lack of haikyuu i see
anime,not_removed,im just happy theyve started making more nanoha content recently
anime,not_removed,dont forget brave witches
anime,not_removed,are you talking about tiger mask w or digimon universe only two toei shows so far as i can see unless youre talking about the precure movie
anime,not_removed,yisssss
anime,not_removed,mahou shoujo ikusei is more akin to future diary than madoka in my opinion from what we know of the plot summary
anime,not_removed,im gonna enjoy all out for reasons no homo
anime,not_removed,this is a good thing its being done by sunrise if you want crazyasfuck mecha theres no better studio than sunrise
anime,not_removed,a sad day for us all
anime,not_removed,iroha and aomine best girl and best guy
anime,not_removed,dont forget sangatsu no lion
anime,not_removed,yeah that and shingeki no bahamut are missing from the list kinda weird that both of them are missing and im hoping its just a mess up
anime,not_removed,chart goes from september to november some of us work differently on seasons spans no taizai is on the one
anime,not_removed,i am its been a while though and im not really sure where they are going to or could take it
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,you should probably watch hibike season then so you can get hyped about it
anime,not_removed,monster hunter with david pro tho
anime,not_removed,nope i read the manga before its not even close but cant blame you the premise does sound a bit like the fte series
anime,not_removed,but made by the creator of hellsing
anime,not_removed,every time a monster appears in mh stories i will kill it in mh gen xd
anime,not_removed,ive read some into the manga no our world history is explored many of the characters are indeed from our history but theyre pulled into another world i believe before they died or such is made by the same person who made hellsing the best part i like is that youll have characters likeoga nobunaga going against more important people from way in the future like world wars and such
anime,not_removed,the red turtle is actually a collaboration of studio ghibli with a french studio it was premiered at a french film festival and seems to be well received
anime,not_removed,looking forward to more cyan
anime,not_removed,found the car driver
anime,not_removed,we will still have the jojo
anime,not_removed,idk this sub has been saying that about every upcoming season
anime,not_removed,wont know until we actually start watching the shows
anime,not_removed,man there is going to be so many jokes comments about being misled by yuri on ices title
anime,not_removed,yuri is a male name you know
anime,not_removed,you thought wed get lesbians on ice no were getting russians on ice
anime,not_removed,to be fair one of the yuris on the show is russian
anime,not_removed,yuri common russian name
anime,not_removed,bsd was planned to be splitcour all along ajin has three movies and the anime are expanding on the movies
anime,not_removed,theres dozens of us
anime,not_removed,one of the ones people are missing is mahou tsukai no yome done by wit studio its at the bottom of the list but its been highly anticipated for a while it seems its only going to be three episodes but its probably going to be good based on the and source material
anime,not_removed,its mostly anime original so noone has any idea what we will get
anime,not_removed,you should also check out wixoss thenif you didnt yet
anime,not_removed,to promote that new spin off game where you ride the monsters instead
anime,not_removed,same for me whats interesting you on this list the only two that are piquing my interest are nanbaka since the ridiculousness of the art style appeals to me and drifters
anime,not_removed,being entirely cg means they can make content way faster drifters has the same director of jojo so naturally im hyped for that sounds cool too
anime,not_removed,fune wo amu is my favorite film of all time i dunno why they are doing an anime of it check out the movie for realz
anime,not_removed,wait wow we really dont have any how many seasons has it been since weve been battle school haremless maybe they saw digibros asswar series and got scared off p
anime,not_removed,totally because ajin and ibo have so many lolis s
anime,not_removed,i am readying my tissues again hc broke me
anime,not_removed,oh lawd
anime,not_removed,i hope theyre using for one of them
anime,not_removed,for those who dont know they did
anime,not_removed,the main character does have a somewhat traumatized backstory but the kawamoto family that takes him in are far from being perfect and quirky if youve read hc youll see a similar narrative where basically every single character in the story gets these long subtle character backstories and the kawamoto girls are no exception edit and to answer your question if it brings anything new id say so its my favorite manga and i really think the writing is among the best ive encountered in any manga
anime,not_removed,from days i feel like theyre capable of doing both the dark and light hearted sides of baccano justice
anime,not_removed,based off what in that list does gatsu come from
anime,not_removed,some of my friends read the manga and its apparently not that good i cant think of any specific complaints they had aside from the art though so i could just be remembering wrong
anime,not_removed,so would you go so far as to say its like ouran high school host club in terms of absurdity of characters cause just reading the premise made me think of ouran immediately
anime,not_removed,not gonna lie i was a bit waaah when i saw it but damn if it isnt just lighthearted fun times
anime,not_removed,now that the ecchi harem infestation had finally died down after like years i dont think ill be complaining about any season any time soon
anime,not_removed,it didnt happen last winter we had shows such as erased generating massive levels of hype preseason
anime,not_removed,there is a vicious seasonal cycle on ranime that we have people declare that we live in the greatest or weakest anime anime season ever it also doesnt just cut one way or the other per season either due to the fact that we have anime that interests one group but also disappoint another it is normal for people to express both polar opinions side by side at the same time
anime,not_removed,maybe the industry is bad at presenting and teasing new releases to the western audience i definitely can recognize the feeling that an upcoming season seems weak but then when it starts i find several good shows that i really enjoy
anime,not_removed,i dont know about others but for me personally its pretty easy to make out what shows ill find entertaining just from seeing the images on these list with the bit of info with them i picked out about shows that looked good this season before they started and none of them have disappointed me yet this fall season looks pretty lackluster but after like seasons straight of bangers all through out im not gonna complain especially since this upcoming season has some gems in it too
anime,not_removed,i think that the main reason why so many are disappointed is that most good series of next season will be sequels sequels to series that quite many havent seen yet also pretty much all original series seem to be more on a side of fanservice also i think that the reason for so lackluster season is that many expected that next season of attack on titan would be aired on this fall maybe big studios just didnt wanted to compete with that
anime,not_removed,thats because it looks bland and shitty
anime,not_removed,because i have a good enough grasp on my tastes to know what i likely will and will not like
anime,not_removed,i dont think people on ranime necessarily write stuff off as they become the biggest circlejerkers in the discussions example me i think people simply post their guesses on the season based on the paper observations and let their opinions evolve over time like me to me ignoring the sequelssecond cours or more i think the season is actually looking rather average but of course opinion doesnt mean what people will actually do especially since we still have a month of summer season left
anime,not_removed,this is the biggest thing i cant tell much more than what the art will be because plots dont really determine how good the story telling is and the list looks pretty bland like rezero looked like a harem anime so i almost avoided watching it these posters are really plain and maybe sell the wrong image
anime,not_removed,the original shows next season are a mystery an exercising short a male idol show digimon a mecha adventure about history a reverse harem music show a cutelooking scifi show another idol show an ice skating show a show whatever vivid strike will be a puzzle show a magical girl show a historical music show that looks like sekkou boys a show about werewolves gundam and the strike witches spinoff how many of those are typical otaku or fujoshi pandering bs the only ones to me that could be pandering are the male idol show anitore and the strike witches spinoff thats out of if you count the kids show
anime,not_removed,yuuri on ice seems to be a touch on the fujoshi side but it has high production values and doesnt look as animeish as free so it might go for real drama instead of pandering fune wo amu could be interesting a show about writing a dictionary doesnt sound like its going to be clicheridden or pandering drifters and luger code bring the action and arent pandering classicaloid sounds like something a bit different but well have to see how its executed trickster has a hamfisted synopsis but isnt just fujoshi bait i hope should be watchable mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku sounds like it could be cool madoka style also march comes in like a lion may be based on a manga but it should be great and theres some sequels to enjoy too so it doesnt look like the worst of seasons
anime,not_removed,commentator guy seems so into it
anime,not_removed,whys there an english version btw
anime,not_removed,whats the first
anime,not_removed,the shaking booty boobs bursting to pop out lmao
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,they fight with their nipples too ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
anime,not_removed,what a time to be alive kreygasm
anime,not_removed,what the glorious fuck fify
anime,not_removed,why does wanna be the strongest in the world have such a low rating on mal
anime,not_removed,girls und panzer in case anyone didnt catch that
anime,not_removed,well massive dive relative to what its like early on in the series the fact that the competitions involve using their boobs and asses to push each other off platforms means theyll always be a floor in how low the fanservice can go
anime,not_removed,a bit yes once you get past the occasional nudity and fanservice theres a crapload of action and interesting characters its like a sportbattle shounen combination
anime,not_removed,exactly its there but the main focus of the show is the actual sport
anime,not_removed,when i say that i mean the ecchi isnt the main focus of the show i dont know if youve seen shokugeki but its similar to that any fanservice moments are the results of moves used during the battles similar to how the fanservice moments in shokugeki are due to foodgasms caused during competitions the competition is the main focus
anime,not_removed,i think its supposed be a recap of zegapain but its supposed to have some new material as well
anime,not_removed,it doesnt focus on shougi much ahh thats a shame from what i understand based on brief lookups on occasion shougi is quite similar to chess except for a few extra pieces and rules again i dont fully understand all of the details myself but it sounds like i will have to go hunting for the information on my own time its a much more character driven show sounds like my kind of anime would highly recommend checking out this show when it airs i will most certainly do so thank you for the early recommendation
anime,not_removed,it doesnt focus on shougi much the most in depth description you will ever get will be from a childrens book one of the characters writes oh really i figured this was gonna turn out like rakugo where the show focused of its efforts on the artistic acts themselves and bored me if they actually do a character driven show and dont bore me with the shougi part im down for a watch
anime,not_removed,dont forget iron blooded orphans and ajin
anime,not_removed,these are the only two that caught my eye
anime,not_removed,impossible to not be hype for sangatsu no lion shaft adapting a manga by the author of honey and clover arguably one of the best slice of life manga sounds too good to be true ive read the manga as well and i really love it
anime,not_removed,but koe no katachi is a movie so you wont get it until the bd comes out years from now
anime,not_removed,you dont read mahou tsukai no yome
anime,not_removed,all out i guess the title refers to the guy in the middle of the posters ass
anime,not_removed,now im watching yuuri on ice becuase of those sexy guys drawings it looks beautiful
anime,not_removed,you kidding spring might not have had the greatest shows ever but it had an incredibly wide spectrum of genres to follow with goodvery good shows going for them lol
anime,not_removed,i can understand both sides of the argument when i first looked nothing really hit me so i dont expect other people to be bowled over either but personally theres quite a few shows id like to watch yuuri on ice for the animation march comes in like a lion because of its critical acclaim fune wo amu because i love wordy anime hopefully this one will be a bit inspired given its subject matter also hoping luger will have elements of this due to its cryptolinguistic themes hibike euphonium gives me a reason to watch the first season will watch this one as well if i enjoy drifters and luger code for a bit of action since there doesnt seem to be too much this season quite refreshing actually keijo for plot classicaloid worth episodes for the premise trickster because its been a while since ive seen a mystery anime and the main character is voiced by gackt mahou shoujo ikusei keikaku because after madoka and yuki yuuna im totally into dark magical girl shows
anime,not_removed,winter had rakugo though and erased was really good for the first half nothing really stands out this season except hibike
anime,not_removed,you cant go wrong with sugitas voice
anime,not_removed,i still need to get to hajime no ippo but if sns is any indication i might actually check it out after all i usually dislike any fanservice in shows where it doesnt belong but if the ecchi parts manage to flow well with the rest i dont mind it i loved prison school and shimoneta and sns has been pretty impressive too so hopefully it can be more like that
anime,not_removed,i did put it right below there as i intend to get to the first two seasons before it starts unless i procrastinate like i always do ive heard great things about it and the ratio of hits to misses from the sports shows ive watched is pretty high so no doubt ill like it
anime,not_removed,tiger mask its based on very old series so im hoping to be surprised
anime,not_removed,i guess its similar to madoka in terms of deconstructing the mahou shoujo genre
anime,not_removed,this show is a mecha too already
anime,not_removed,the manaria friends one is on indefinite delay due to various circumstances the virgin soul one doesnt have a definite date yet as far as i know
anime,not_removed,this is quite odd i remember that is also based off of edogawa ranpos works never knew that yoshi kobayashi and kogorou akechi were homages to his works seeing as how both shows have characters with those names unless this is a sequel in disguise i doubt that though
anime,not_removed,thanks for clearing it up will definitely follow the series now haha
anime,not_removed,sounds like a nice plan im not expecting much from the anime but hey more monster hunter is more monster hunter
anime,not_removed,oga nobunaga going against more important people from way in the future like world wars and such so basically fatezero minus the part where they fully lived their lives and made their mark on history how are they even considered historical at that point when theyre brought into the modern world midway one thing i liked about fatezero is that each one of them had their own philosophy and beliefs from their own era and having varying perspectives of each other how much do they explore this aspect still sounds interesting enough though might check out the manga
anime,not_removed,huh til
anime,not_removed,the opposite actually i hate driving and use my bike to get around usually as well as for exercise the wheel size of most of these folding bikes is between to inches in diameter most commonly found on childrens bikes whereas a large chunk of mountain bikes and practically all adult road bikes have a wheel size of inches road bike wheels are usually listed as but ive never been able to tell what that number refers to the only advantage a folding bike would have would be acceleration but its top speed would be noticeably lower than any road bike
anime,not_removed,well normally i have something i will pick up but this season there is nothing at all lots of sequels of shows i didnt watch for now i only have jjba diamond is unbreakable for fall planned probably going through my ptwlist for once
anime,not_removed,thats a lie this spring and summer seasons were quite hyped up by this sub at least from what ive seen from this kind of threads
anime,not_removed,i mean im not watching it either way but i definitely went and read the synopsis severely confused at the lack of women in it
anime,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiyurigagarin
anime,not_removed,heh well i gave it a second pass and i think the number is closer to five
anime,not_removed,thats really high praise added to my ptw then
anime,not_removed,it is called sangatsu no lion in the chart
anime,not_removed,i dislike the frequency people criticize ecchi harems as if their arent plenty of other genres we get tons of generic versions of
anime,not_removed,completely agree with that cant remember how long its been since we had a season without at least one of the synopsis reading just joined the and accidentally saw naked optional boobgrab and duel challenge
anime,not_removed,ecchi infestation is still going strong in fact its fucking ridiculous how strong it is for fall something new from xebec that looks like its going to use ecchi as a huge crutch havent read source material if any student counsel president is my wife hype pogchamp this season has some strong lookers but to me beyond maybe or non sequelssecond cours its looking very average
anime,not_removed,im not sure where youre getting that looking back at the it was below ajin gate and dagashi kashi in popularity and in high expectations from what i remember it was barely mentioned at all before it aired and because the most hyped shows were sequels dagashi kashi got hyped for some weird reason and we all know how also funny thing that in the thread i linked theres some people having the exact same discussion as this one weak seasons and whatnot
anime,not_removed,ive seen at least one person call every season since complete shit theres no pleasing everyone
anime,not_removed,well for one much of the shows being adapted comes from manga or light novels that usually dont get released on the west so japanese viewers tends to be much better informed anime magazines also breaks the news and shows off interviews with creators quite often
anime,not_removed,whatever vivid strike will be vivid strike is part of the nanoha franchise
anime,not_removed,the exersizing short is the second season of it expect lolis and girls sweating and ding exersize for a few minutes informative but quite creepy depending on the character exersizibg that episode and if its creepy for me then its really quite creepy
anime,not_removed,is the show shuumatsu no izetta the description for that doesnt say much but i have some hopes for it
anime,not_removed,its so refreshing to see a variety after the last years just being battle harem battle harem battle harem
anime,not_removed,personally the only ones im finding interesting from the synopsis are the werewolf one and the one about the immortal guy other than that nothing really stands out to me ill hold my judgment till the shows start airing but as it stands my hype is pretty nonexistent thats just me though
anime,not_removed,you have it backwards the only general audience type shows from that list are the show the werewolf show as long as it doesnt go into fujo territory and the gundam sequel
anime,not_removed,all the idol shows magical girl shows and fujoyuri shows are otaku pandering whether or not that is good or bad depends on the viewer but there is a lot of otaku pandering going on in the fall for someone like me that isnt all that interested in that not a great season for me people want more originals but they mean stuff like shirobako things that arent prototypical theres about shows im gonna pick up but thats like less than i normally do and ill probably drop of them it will likely help me catch up on my backlog though
anime,not_removed,pandering shows reglia antinore xx dream festival magickyun renaissance idol memories shuumatsu no izetta nazotokine brave witches shoushin shoujo matoi unknown but will most likely fall under pandering yuri on ice vivid strike flip flappers thats out of out of if we include the maybe cases im going to take a wild guess and say you have a very strict definition of pandering if you want i could break it down and explain why i think those shows are pandering to the otaku or fujoshi audience
anime,not_removed,who wouldnt i know i would
anime,not_removed,and so am i
anime,not_removed,i have no idea call up jim in marketing if craig picks up yell various derogatory phrases at him until he cries then instruct him to hand the phone over to jim if you are in a rush you can just tell him to hand the phone immediately over to jim then after asking your questions you can ask jim to berate craig for you
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,ftfw fifi
anime,not_removed,ah ok thats fine then fan service is one of the most important things for me when choosing anime so as long as it stays relatively lewd im happy
anime,not_removed,and kuroku no basket movie
anime,not_removed,no natsume yuujinchou season love
anime,not_removed,good things are worth waiting for
anime,not_removed,no is it good
anime,not_removed,i feel like for sexy drawings all out might be even better
anime,not_removed,winter had rakugo yeah but one show alone doesnt make something the best i think this winter was a great winter but it still just cant beat the quantity that a good springfall has nothing really stands out this season wholly disagree i actually dont really count hibike among the ones that stand out either p
anime,not_removed,it is it is im so so so so excited excitedyui out of
anime,not_removed,naming a character akechi in japan would be tantamount to a western author naming their character sherlock
anime,not_removed,interesting i think ill check out that anime to get a better plus plus it looks pretty nice thanks
anime,not_removed,a thing to note is that theyre not brought into a modern world but more into a fantasy like if i remember right they were elves in it and unlike in fate where they serve as servants here i believe they could do what they wanted also going from what i remember i have not kept up with the manga in some years their historic mark i dont remember them being brought up as much universe wise so we dont even know if in their world they manage to leave their mark in history but again i didnt keep up with the manga so i dont know if this ever changed its more like the viewer sees the character and goes oh this is so and so and he did this and that in real life like you im also gonna go back and start with the beginning to catch up im mainly gonna watch it cause its the artwork of hellsing which has always been badass for me
anime,not_removed,no i mean off of what hes gonna watch what makes you think hed like gatsu
anime,not_removed,i think thats just because theyre usually the worst offenders of this as an sol fan ill honestly admit that a lot of character archetypes are recycled in the many shows that ive seen at least especially the cgdct shows which have the airhead protagonist genki girl shy and reserved girl rich lady etc that said they usually have some innovation in the setting or character interactions which havent been used a hundred times before if you look at ecchi battle harems theres almost always a dense mc tsundere main girlbonus points for being a princess or having a highranking said mc doing the same tired walk in on undressing girl faceplanting on girls boobs boobgrabs etc etc with almost no new spin on it to keep it fresh at least shows like shinmai maou and masou gakuen take it a step further and do something different even if its just embracing the ecchi
anime,not_removed,my tastes are pretty allencompassing its hard for me to find something i truly dislike to the point of regretting watching it i can usually find something to enjoy in any show the shows im watching from this season if youre interested spoiler
anime,not_removed,im hyped for more nanoha love the series
anime,not_removed,ah i see
anime,not_removed,do i have to watch the whole nanoha franchise first
anime,not_removed,i didnt think it was that risque hinako training series is definitely lewder in comparison real pantyshots and not swimsuits though this show does have a petit blonde girl she isnt really an actual loli and the girls do act like they are being filmed too
anime,not_removed,its germania instead of germany but more or less wwii yeah the pv looked interesting
anime,not_removed,im really excited for digimon but thats just because that was the shit growing up and i may or may not have the digimon movie dozens of times over the years
anime,not_removed,will most likely fall under pandering yuri on ice considering that this is by sayo yamamoto who managed to have i highly doubt that this will be pandering as well if anything its easily one of the most promising things on the list imo and i dislike otaku and fujoshi pandering as well
anime,not_removed,whats wrong with nazotokine
anime,not_removed,how does it matter if the show is pandering to the certain audience if its a good show anyway
anime,not_removed,well gimme his number then
anime,not_removed,even though were halfway into the part i still love watching this
anime,not_removed,apparently youre not allowed to have fanservice as a primary reason to choose an anime here
anime,not_removed,its in
anime,not_removed,my point is that by the time you get it it wont be fall season anymore so theres no point really in counting movies to be a part of a season
anime,not_removed,pretty good sad that its gonna be only ovas
anime,not_removed,kobayashi would then be the watson
anime,not_removed,oh ok cool still sounds interesting to say the least im reading chapter at the moment thanks for the info
anime,not_removed,if you like natsume and koe no katachi you with like gatsu lion similar themes and such also it is sorta a sports series heh if you look on manga updates natsume and gatsu lion are recommended together along with koe no katachi on mal
anime,not_removed,cgdct what is that and yea i know ecchi harems are probably the worst offenders of it i just dislike when the entire genre gets oversimplified and dismissed relative to other genres that tend to recycle things like sols even nonsuper generic ecchi harems get bashed more than the sol equivalent of the show i think if theyre werent so many of them it wouldnt bother people as much
anime,not_removed,from the name i would assume its a sequel to vivid
anime,not_removed,look at the character and ask yourself whats the purpose of her character design
anime,not_removed,look if you think a show that has extensive pandering is good thats great dont let my opinion ruin it for you whether a show is good or not is highly subjective after all personally i cant remember the last time i watched a series that was good and had extensive pandering
anime,not_removed,i am excited to watch diamond is unbreakable once it is finished airing i am rewatching both seasons of stardust crusaders in preparation for it
anime,not_removed,well lets be honest here most of the people in ranime are not the target audience for the series created anyway they are aimed at japanese audiences and sold to the rest of the world as an afterthought watch what you like and dont care what other people think about your favorite series
anime,not_removed,ah thanks for correcting me
anime,not_removed,gay watson
anime,not_removed,no problem
anime,not_removed,cgdct stands for cute girls doing cute things
anime,not_removed,cgdct is the popular acronym for cute girls doing cute things type of shows like kon and bakuon also i think sols get bashed quite often too theres always some people with the sols are all generic moe shows and people only watch them for the cute girls talk oh and i do agree that the sheer number of ecchi harem shows coming out each season has an effect on the hate toward them also ive actually read the lns of quite a few of these type of shows and i think the conversion to anime tends to make the end product look worse than the original is most of the ecchi harems build on the same foundation but at least in the ln theres more worldbuilding and characterization which gets lost in the transition to anime i mean i read up to of gakusen toshi asterisk but still cant bring myself to finish the first season of the anime
anime,not_removed,while i admit the girl on the promo picture does look rather pleasing just because most shows that use fanservice turn out bad it doesnt mean all shows that use fanservice are bad what actually pulled me in was the very brief description of having professor layton like puzzles which is a concept id be interested to see done in anime so the anime already promises an interesting concept why is it not allowed to have fanservice if it already has something else going for it there is a reason im interested in nazotokine but not keijo which has a whole lot more blatant fap material
anime,not_removed,the one on the list is a recap movie
anime,not_removed,yea id say moe comes in to ecchi harems in terms of getting lots of criticismprobably because theyre such anime concepts yea i always hear the lns and vns of these harem shows are a lot better like theres a show airing now called and ive had complaints about how often the tsundere has punched the mc plus a random time he grabbed her behind while looking for snakes in the grass and my friend who played the vn told me the latter doesnt happen in the vn and that theyve made her more punchhappy in the anime for some reason they just add weird stuff when adapting shows funny you mention asterisk wars i actually enjoyed it wasnt great by any means but i liked the girls i didnt find them generic not great but better than some of the generic types you see in mediocre harems and the action was good only problem was the mc
anime,not_removed,when i see the promo image of nazotokine the shows creators are basically telling me this look i dont think the shows premise is good enough so heres a hot girl in a skin tight costume to appeal to you and theres going to be more please watch my show and my reaction to that is nope sorry i wont its rather cynical i admit but that happens when youve been watching anime for a while p
anime,not_removed,i agree with you i think in the anime the ending was left openended to make people consider humanxsoulweaponhybrid or something like that try the manga maybe at least the manga actually ended with an actual ending its kinda long though
anime,not_removed,thats the general consensus it was on its way to being a for me but the terrible ending brought it down to a low since the journey was more than worth it also
anime,not_removed,yeah i felt the anime ending strayed just a bit too far from the manga you should definetely check out the source material better hope bones pulls a brotherhood retcon the anime original ending and adapt the rest of the manga
anime,not_removed,as long as the manga was when i finished i was still left wanting more there was plenty more they could have done if they wanted to continue the anime for a while longer before ending it but at least the ending was better than the anime one
anime,not_removed,fate extra is not even airing in
anime,not_removed,didnt even mention disappointment is had
anime,not_removed,expecting a mention of the remake of logh disappointed this website doesnt understand greatness
anime,not_removed,ok so this website posted this march dunno why konosuba and blue exorcist are there and lwa is half done no mention of bahamut for reasons also no mentions of violet evergarden or kekkai sensen pretty generic list mostly battle shounen one genre yay
anime,not_removed,upcomingcurrent lol current means anime thats ongoing man
anime,not_removed,konosuba and blue exorcist are both done though
anime,not_removed,i wanna see a pokemon anime based on pokemon conquest anything to break away from the current formula really
anime,not_removed,kingdom hearts it would join the list of when anime metal gear at least snake eater pls golden sun cour and a half for gs and the other for prof layton ff ivvi or ix mother i would say mother too but i havent played that one yet i heard it is just like the first mother whith a few changes and without the original
anime,not_removed,can i get dishonered please
anime,not_removed,lets have an anime adaptation for dark souls
anime,not_removed,definitely the legend of zelda that would be absolutely amazing if done right
anime,not_removed,fire emblem awakening
anime,not_removed,ace combat
anime,not_removed,a few that i would like to see armor core series giant mecha battles become a sport transistor if the art style and story telling mechanisms could be transferred to anime it would be one hell of a ride bravely default imagine the plot from aldnoah zero but fantasy setting with great characters destiny with the massive amount of lore and such a rich universe i would love to see an adaption maybe set at the end of the golden age that could be cool
anime,not_removed,touhou dark souls skullgirls a neptunia anime thats more than one cour and follows story
anime,not_removed,the worlds ends with you ghost trick would like to have the series but it might me hard to adapt it would end up like phoenix wright
anime,not_removed,how about metal gear rising anime with raiden as main character with artstyle of yoji shikawa and with internse gore and nice story
anime,not_removed,fifa
anime,not_removed,command and conquer series
anime,not_removed,undertale made by shaft i think only shaft could be capable of properly deliver a good tsunderplane
anime,not_removed,every disgaea game actually just every nis game in general phantom brave and zhp in particular would be really cool this is coming from someone who didnt mind the first games anime aside from its horrific animation theres no defending that
anime,not_removed,overwatch
anime,not_removed,splatoon any dragon quest anarchy reigns and madworld jet set radio any oddworld although western animation would arguably be better for it no more heroes
anime,not_removed,ftl would be pretty cool because of the different species interacting on the ship and each jumps could be episodes or something
anime,not_removed,oh its this thread again the answer as usual is the witcher but that would be rather an answer to another question which novelshort story collection should be adapted into an anime
anime,not_removed,shadow of the colossus would be amazing
anime,not_removed,honestly monster hunter its such a rich universe that has the beauty of not having a defined story so the adaptation wouldnt need to follow a strict storyline wich gives to the writer a well crafted and packed world to do whatever he wants it also is the most succesfull gaming franchise in japan so its kinda of a shock there isnt an adaptation yet
anime,not_removed,dragons dogma daggerfall and morrowind and the lusty argonian maid
anime,not_removed,the elder scroll series
anime,not_removed,homeworld games would be cool showing the lives of the people living on that bigass mothership scrounging for materials and trying to find a new home i can feel the warmth and friendly camaraderie already freespace games along the same lines as the above would be an epic tale of survival against the shivans anime seems to do these kinds of things well also would have to show the vasudans and how they arent all that bad and then grudgingly becoming allies a lot of nuance and scifi politics to explore and flash out a masterpiece of an epic space sim mechwarrior games giant robots seem to do well as anime shows and the universe is incredibly rich and can tell a variety of stories from various perspectives clan invasion house vs house comstar rom espionage mercenary living pirating out in the periphery the anime could start from the present day of the battletech timeline with the aftermath of the soviet civil war and progress through the formation of the terran hegemony the establishment of the ares conventions the formation of the star league the tragic fall of the star league kerenskys exodus and the various succession wars all leading up to the blitzkrieg of the clan invasion into the inner sphere in op revival titanfall games metal gear solid games seem like no brainers the story is already completely batshit insane like a lot of anime mass effect games assassins creed games gta games could be a slice of life show
anime,not_removed,kid icirusuprising
anime,not_removed,need for speed most wanted
anime,not_removed,the world ends with you
anime,not_removed,i was actually thinking about this the other day the last of us
anime,not_removed,dota
anime,not_removed,i am shocked that not a single person has mentioned bioshock or bioshock infinite
anime,not_removed,id like to see an anime of life is strange
anime,not_removed,pokemon go the anime and make it a harem drama romcom idk how the plot would go but i think it would be pretty interesting
anime,not_removed,also known as yakuza in the west
anime,not_removed,the only correct answer is super smash bros
anime,not_removed,the last of us
anime,not_removed,i think super smash bros would be amazing
anime,not_removed,i would want to see planescape torment as an anime the characters in that game are pretty interesting the setting is unusual but the premise might seem generic with immortal protagonist with amnesia
anime,not_removed,dark souls prepare to fap edition
anime,not_removed,im still holding out hope that a splatoon anime is secretly in the works
anime,not_removed,just give me a zero escape anime danganronpa got so i hope zero escape can at least get
anime,not_removed,borderlands by either shaft or trigger
anime,not_removed,no vn i suppose so vampirebloodlines has a good complex story a famous and engaging setting and can be a good anime problem two licence to buy fallout or nv its another good setting and good story so can be a good anime too chrono trigger of course time sheningans and a lovable cast what else you need i will die for a long adaptation of king of fighting theres a short anime of it but its short planetscapetorment incredible setting very deep story good cast will be perfect problem two licence to buy edit too much people forgets what need to become a good anime a good story a good cast and a good setting not only one of them
anime,not_removed,id want to see a adaption of the zero escape series s shit ending a proper danganronpa anime would be nice too
anime,not_removed,fire emblem rekka no ken or fire emblem fates id also love xenoblade chronicles x or the original would be fine although i would prefer x
anime,not_removed,back before shit went down hill and kojima left konami i think the metal gear series would have made a great ghost in a shell type anime tons of crazy stuff happens action and weirdness
anime,not_removed,metal gear solid
anime,not_removed,metro i want that now
anime,not_removed,gravity rush it has an interesting theme style in it already kingdom hearts with the art style from the manga and also because noone can follow the plot at this point hopefully an anime could simplify it super monkey ball for shits and giggles itd still be more interesting than star driver
anime,not_removed,obligatory dynasty warriorsrotk anime that aside i can see the castlevania series translating well as an anime give it the jojo treatment of generation based protagonists leon trevor christopher etc
anime,not_removed,saya no uta
anime,not_removed,i know theyre making efforts to improve it but i think if the lore actually made sense a league of legends anime could actually do insanely well the world is already somewhat fleshed out and theres plenty of characters to love and hate theres definitely demand for it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvrzmlfgaag and a is even being made also a better blazblue anime would be pretty good i wasnt really a fan of
anime,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiihavenomouthandimustscream httpsenwikipediaorgwikiihavenomouthandimustscreamvideogame
anime,not_removed,bioshock
anime,not_removed,i wonder if there is any appetite for a warstarcraft anime alongside the previously mentioned overwatch anime and if those could one day cross over into a heroes of the storm anime last one seems a bit far fetched but warcraft and starcraft have plenty of lore to run around with
anime,not_removed,valkyria chronicles
anime,not_removed,the world ends with you an old ds game has a very anime plot as it is
anime,not_removed,i would love to see a witcher anime the amount of chacters lore action and fan service would be amazing hell you wouldnt even need geralt just put it on the continent
anime,not_removed,punchout for sure an underdog zany characters each of them already has a particular weakness and there are plenty of other successful sports anime so why not
anime,not_removed,scrolled through somewhat quickly but really surprised to see no dragon age great set of characters that would be easily adaptable into an anime format would watch
anime,not_removed,im surprised that there hasnt been one for eve online someone at ccp reykjavik needs to hire for the job you know the guy responsible for yeah he deserves to play in eves sandbox just to see what he can build
anime,not_removed,technically hyperdimension neptunia has an anime adaptation i just want like more seasons
anime,not_removed,which video game do you think should be adapted into an anime hrmmmmmmmmm maybe an adaptation of god of war killer main character lots of intense action and an ost that would hype the masses although the actual story content would be lacking a bit p another more interesting one would be shadow of the colossus make it a short something like five minutes or so that follows the same feel as the game ie very little dialogue beautiful landscapes and a generally ambivalent atmosphere again story content would be lacking but thats why it would be a short instead
anime,not_removed,deserves a full tv adaptation
anime,not_removed,somebody said fire emblem so why not professor layton if ace attorney can get an anime then so can professor layton
anime,not_removed,i think a game from the infamous series would probably work pretty well preferably infamous
anime,not_removed,stardew valley
anime,not_removed,either legend of zelda kid icarus which already has a few anime specials or witcher
anime,not_removed,star ocean
anime,not_removed,runescape or starcraft
anime,not_removed,dark souls
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,ni no kuni s seriously though an okami anime would be gorgeous
anime,not_removed,id love to see an anime set in rapture not an actual adaption of any of the bioshock games but something set before bioshock with anime original characters and story
anime,not_removed,warframe the second dream quest line would make for a good arc
anime,not_removed,awakened fate
anime,not_removed,god of war i liked the books and the first game actually has a story thats objectively well done
anime,not_removed,diablo would be nice i guess we have shingeki no bahamut but it would still be nice
anime,not_removed,mechwarrior as a simultaneously more down to earth and more out there mecha show sure the mechs dont fly just jump jet or go into space but theyre supported by fucking httpwwwsarnanetwikiaerospacefighter as heavy as they are and fight along with httpwwwsarnanetwikibattlearmor and httpwwwsarnanetwikicombatvehicle that are actually competitively armed if not as well armored the mechs also httpwwwsarnanetwikifusionengine if destroyed improperly killing or damaging everything within a hundred meters and melee combat between mechs is not uncommon dont forget the httpwwwsarnanetwikimobilefieldbase or the httpwwwsarnanetwikiclans
anime,not_removed,the first two games of suikoden would be fantastic just the sheer amount of characters introduced would be hilarious to see actually any of the games would be fun besides httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvijyrdksqe dragon quest viii its just a super fun well made game with enticing story and enjoyable characters plus more art by akira toriyama
anime,not_removed,metal gear solid series definitely i think this one could translate very well into anime id really love to see a bioshock anime as well but it would be extremely hard to pull off
anime,not_removed,going for an odd one here luminous arc
anime,not_removed,destiny made by ufotable straight up it would be a dream
anime,not_removed,warframe
anime,not_removed,ive always wanted a good devil may cry anime i know there is one but apparently its not that good although ive not seen it tbf or legend of dragoon would be nice
anime,not_removed,id like to see a no more heroes or dragon quest viii
anime,not_removed,bloodborne central character is a silent protagonist the player character from the games each episode focuses on one of the games secondary characters
anime,not_removed,dishonored follow the story of both corvo and daud switching between the two as both their stories unfold leading up until the climax where the two face off then the final two episodes could just be the end of corvos journey id say both would be doing low chaos eliminations as other wise itd just be kill this kill that this also would allow side characters like slackjaw and granny rags to be involved during corvos story
anime,not_removed,star ocean rune factory
anime,not_removed,prince of persia warrior within currently buried in the depths of oblivion
anime,not_removed,for me its ffvi or the first xenoblade which had an amazing with my favs being metal face and melia
anime,not_removed,i would say something like legend of dragoon but saint seiya exists so theres no point there i would love a borderlands anime though
anime,not_removed,grand theft auto except trevor is a woman and add a japanese businessman
anime,not_removed,not an anime with the game itself but rather the core concept id love to see an anime like far cry where the mc slowly loses his humanity trying to save someone else
anime,not_removed,stella glow need all the waifus
anime,not_removed,final fantasy golden sun the first two games metroid prime the trilogy prof layton every game any zelda game actually plus if it is majoras mask lol or dota following the lore perfect dark would be really good
anime,not_removed,ctrlf uma musume hits i am really disappointed ranime
anime,not_removed,pls it has everything an anime needs
anime,not_removed,was going to say monster hunter but then i realized it probably already does edit quick google search shows that there is something idk exactly what it is though
anime,not_removed,super mario
anime,not_removed,majoras mask
anime,not_removed,old school runescape cx imagine a noob trying to win over this girlfriend in the runescape world all while trying to avoid getting scammed at the ge and training his way to become master in a skill in order to impress her it would be hilarious
anime,not_removed,i dont know how far away we are from reaching this reality but yume nikki
anime,not_removed,shin megami tensei strange journey
anime,not_removed,american truck simulator
anime,not_removed,im probably alone on this but id love to see the xcom games turned into an anime i think theres so much potential in turning those games into a tv series of some kind
anime,not_removed,way late to the thread but id say the darkness originally a comic i believe it had a really great story that would probably translate well to animation
anime,not_removed,king of fightersa legit adaptation this time either orochi saga or nests saga grab masami obari out ofwherever he is apparently dude hasnt done anything since super robot wars in since he is fatal fury guy
anime,not_removed,i think steinsgate would be amazing
anime,not_removed,im not sure if anyone remembers this game still but i would love to see catherine adapted into a full blown anime i know its already kind of a anime but i would be really interested to see how it good it would be if it was a full blown anime
anime,not_removed,advance wars
anime,not_removed,overwatch definitely it already has a big anime feel with the outrageous characters and personalities and baes so yeah overwatch definitely
anime,not_removed,tales of symphonia best tales game by far and its story would work well in an episodic format zestiria can go hide in a corner in the interim
anime,not_removed,red dead redemption the legend of john marston must be told
anime,not_removed,tales of symphonia
anime,not_removed,armored core and its sequel for answer
anime,not_removed,the uncharted series
anime,not_removed,lots of people saying dark souls but id rather see bloodborne i feel like the lore would be better for an anime and be slightly easier to insert
anime,not_removed,guilty gear no more heroes or xenoblade chronicles
anime,not_removed,witcher games would probably port into anime fairly well ditto for most bioware rpgs
anime,not_removed,radiant historia
anime,not_removed,not many people know of it but i feel like resonance of fate would make a great single cour anime
anime,not_removed,im kinda surprise no one has mentioned destiny yet anybody that plays this game knows how awesome an anime would be
anime,not_removed,im going to offer two i think would make good series cosmic fantasy this jrpg had an frivolous oav in the shortly before telnet japan folded but it didnt really add anything to the cannon of the series the protagonist and his gf go on a date and are followed by a villain from the previous game from what i understand a lot of the staff involved with this game eventually we essential in making the namco tales of games i find the universe of cosmic fantasy to be a little more unique than those of tales lunar the silver star
anime,not_removed,i would love an ar tonelicoar nosurge adaptation also the last of us
anime,not_removed,dead or alives whole story would make an incredibly good anime imo
anime,not_removed,the world ends with you would make an amazing anime its got visually appealing combat a great story and interesting characters
anime,not_removed,the world ends with you would make an amazing anime its got a great story interesting characters and visually appealing combat and it isnt too long so it wont suffer from the sort of rushed pacing that video game animes like persona the animation suffered from
anime,not_removed,id like to see witcher that would be cool
anime,not_removed,xenoblade chronicles awesome revenge story that gets better as the game progresses and the fight scenes would be fucking insane
anime,not_removed,a dark souls prequel anime focusing on the knights of gwyn would be cool
anime,not_removed,kingdom hearts bar none
anime,not_removed,metroid although itd probably work better as a film than as a series
anime,not_removed,hyper light drifter would be amazing i feel
anime,not_removed,final fantasy tactics
anime,not_removed,spec ops the line
anime,not_removed,shadow of the colossus make this happen
anime,not_removed,dark souls oh wait
anime,not_removed,suikoden would make a badass anime
anime,not_removed,shadow of the colossus would be amazing make it a short form anime episodes for collosi
anime,not_removed,assassins creed would be nice
anime,not_removed,dark souls assassins creed deus ex saga super mario bros final fantasy red dead redemption halo saga fables witcher saga bloodborne
anime,not_removed,mother will tear people apart if animated well edit if instead of of
anime,not_removed,i would love to see an anime made from guilty gear i could would be very happy if the make an adventure anime of the adventures of johny and the jelly fish pirates i mean it is already there with the games with theyr anime style just look at that smile
anime,not_removed,overwatch dark souls chibirobo
anime,not_removed,kingdom hearts and bayonetta
anime,not_removed,random oldies time grim fandango anachronox steel empire
anime,not_removed,esports seriously please
anime,not_removed,danganronpa
anime,not_removed,overwatch could be anime
anime,not_removed,overwatch
anime,not_removed,if the pokémon anime went the way of the pokémon manga instead of marketing it for kids and simply sticking ash into another region it might have actually been interesting
anime,not_removed,ash is still the main character fails to beat the final boss again entire region comes under final boss control ash is forever remembered as the person who failed to free the region and hated by its inhabitants
anime,not_removed,if we had more pokemon anime like pokemon origins i would be so freaking happy
anime,not_removed,oh my god golden sun would be great i legit never even considered that
anime,not_removed,prof layton ever watch the professor layton movie if i got a series like that id be pretty happy
anime,not_removed,i would kill for a snake eater anime adaptation
anime,not_removed,holy shit anime version of ffix sounds so good
anime,not_removed,they did sort of make a metal gear anime called
anime,not_removed,i support on the golden sun i would not mind three seasons season for book one and seasons for book seeing how it has so much content season should have a ova devoted for crossbone isles and isaacs party fighting deadbeard
anime,not_removed,kingdom hearts had a cartoon planned who knows how long ago that they eventually decided not to go through with
anime,not_removed,well professor layton got a movie made by pa works actually so theres that off the list i guess
anime,not_removed,you havent played earthbound
anime,not_removed,holy fuck yes please animated by ufotable
anime,not_removed,it would be hilarious if corvo is still silent
anime,not_removed,this one would be pretty good the first game would be a nice story
anime,not_removed,we already have thatit is called rezero
anime,not_removed,posted on another comment
anime,not_removed,berserk
anime,not_removed,true i can even imagine theres potential for some jojolike battles since zelda bosses are known to be gimmicky and link sometimes makes creative use of his weapons and spells to beat them
anime,not_removed,check out the recently released twilight princess manga if you havent already its really good so far and very mature and brutal for zelda
anime,not_removed,oh its been
anime,not_removed,dear god the shipping fights over who is the cannon matchup though
anime,not_removed,the chances of it getting an adaptation pick a god and pray
anime,not_removed,this i dont even care if its shit i just wanna see best girls lucina and severa fates would be a pretty good adaption too
anime,not_removed,all of the fire emblem games tbh i havent played all the games but all the ones i have ive loved my only gripe really is the world building these are fantastic settings for these stories but they throw so much shit at you at one time its almost overwhelming
anime,not_removed,if my lunatic run has anything to say about this and we consider that the mc has to eventually be op the mc eventually has to become morgan and it should be with nah as the mother
anime,not_removed,if any fire emblem game should be made into an anime its geneology that one also doesnt happen to have a kinda broken story
anime,not_removed,the story isnt all that good as far as im concerned well mostly because of the characters path of radiance though
anime,not_removed,male or female mu oh how fucking cares either of them would be freaking glorious wait wait wait does that mean i would see best daughter morgan animated kill me now my life is complete
anime,not_removed,you have it wrong ace combat is anime in videogame form
anime,not_removed,haha yes ace combat zero would have been a great show
anime,not_removed,oh my goodness i was just gonna comment this an ace combat anime with action like from assault horizon and story as good a i could just die happy
anime,not_removed,squadron leaderthe unsung war was amazing i still watch the trailer from time to time for that tingly feeling
anime,not_removed,came here to say this was the best
anime,not_removed,bravely default s because i really love the endless eight it would be really cool though i really love the characters of the series slowly playing through bravely second
anime,not_removed,supergiant games could make for pretty great anime bastion afterstory please though to be honest i would just love to see an anime with jen zee as the lead visual designer
anime,not_removed,holy shit another armored core fan d
anime,not_removed,on the topic of fromsoft games bloodborne central character is a silent protagonist the player character from the games each episode focuses on one of the games secondary characters
anime,not_removed,while i love bdand bs as a game their story is one of their weak pointsespecially in bs imo where nothing really happens in the first half bd is a fairly generic final fantasyesque story with some twists later down the line lots of things would need to be added for it to make an anime
anime,not_removed,a destiny anime would probably be just about the only way they can consolidate all that lore into easy bite sized pieces
anime,not_removed,dark souls would be really hard to adapt unless you want everyone to not understand the story by the end
anime,not_removed,touhou is not an anime yet
anime,not_removed,its not impossible but i think itd be very hard to make a top notch anime for dark souls the settings are amazing but the lore is somewhat hard to turn into something people would watch partly because a lot of it is being community driven and partly because fromsoft doesnt really have it set in stone what and who some characters are i mean for games most people believed a certain sun bro was royalty until came out which still isnt because fromsoft rarely gives any yes or no answers about this stuff plus the fact that the player is speechless doesnt help at all im all for this if a company could pull all of this off but it would be pretty difficult
anime,not_removed,ask and ye shall receive
anime,not_removed,there already is a dark souls anime berserk
anime,not_removed,if a twewy adaptation happens i just hope they do the music justice with some sweet remixes
anime,not_removed,ghost trick might be difficult if we just watch sissel using his powers there can be a lot of issues now and again about knowing what he can or cant manipulate its easier in the game because we guide him and see the cores that were specifically placed for gameplay purposes
anime,not_removed,i would love the world ends with you to be adapted to an anime such an amazing game
anime,not_removed,it would be impossible to do the zero escape series justice through an anime you have to figure out the plot and twists by playing it would ruin the experience and be even more confusing than it actually is
anime,not_removed,its just like one of my japanese animes hal emmerich
anime,not_removed,alex hunter
anime,not_removed,nba livin da dream what a fucking ride that would be
anime,not_removed,anime with kane ion canons and tiberium i need this
anime,not_removed,i cant see it working personally a pretty central part of undertales identity is its metastory thats entirely driven by the actions of the player and translating that to a noninteractive medium would be essentially impossible i also cant think of a way to work in the time travel element without it feeling like it came completely out of nowhere
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,itd be cool for a spinoff series but undertale is built in such a way as the story could only work if it was a game
anime,not_removed,my god what i wouldnt do to see alphys and undyne animated
anime,not_removed,there is a episode anime based off disgaea agree on the others though
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,the animations were just so well done i imagine an overwatch anime sort of like the fate series where there is a lot of beautiful fighting with some story in between
anime,not_removed,i think blizzard will deliver something since they made a movie on wow
anime,not_removed,junkrat best girl
anime,not_removed,baka
anime,not_removed,splatoon stop i have had enough of their fanarts and i dont want to see any more
anime,not_removed,i actually wanna see splatoon anime if there is more doujin incoming
anime,not_removed,not really the games and books are separate the author has said that the games arent canon to his stories and novels i get where youre coming from though
anime,not_removed,its a good game but there is so little said i think best left that way also the mechanics and puzzle nature of the game are the interesting part and that would be very hard to convey in an anime adaptation
anime,not_removed,attack on titan may be the closest well get
anime,not_removed,theres a monster hunter stories adaption next season about as close as youre going to get for now if this pans out well then we might see adaptations of other mh games
anime,not_removed,mh tri
anime,not_removed,mmm you like those lizard scales
anime,not_removed,we know bbaka its not like i wanted you to know its not like i like taking arrows to the knee
anime,not_removed,hell yeah its even got catgirls
anime,not_removed,gta oniichan do you want to go bowling
anime,not_removed,yeah theyve already done anime shorts for it in the past so its not really too unreasonable maybe if the series gets another game before the year
anime,not_removed,id prefer that as a weekend morning cartoon kinda show tbh
anime,not_removed,its called initial d
anime,not_removed,not the game itself but id love a esports anime based around it i mean weve already got kickass documentaries within and so one based on following a team or player could be really fun
anime,not_removed,rylai best girl
anime,not_removed,whatever happened to that manhua about the guy playing dota i know chapter translation updates were posted on the dota subreddit a while back but they just stopped was good stuff great art all colored too
anime,not_removed,like the fallout series i think their themes of century american jingoismxenophobia and americana wouldnt be appreciated as much outside the us what am i saying xenophobia is definitley something the japanese can understand
anime,not_removed,im gonna have to disagree there the original bioshock is best suited to the medium its already in and infinites plot really isnt all that stellar
anime,not_removed,competitive scene is absolutely anime tho
anime,not_removed,yes something with and a battle royal type story
anime,not_removed,im pretty sure there was an ova for chrono trigger actually from what ive heard it isnt that great though unfortunately though a new adaptation could be phenomenal with enough effort and a full series
anime,not_removed,only played the birthright route of fates and found it one of the most boring game stories ever so it would probably be even worse in an anime where theres no gameplay heard the other two are better but after how bored of it i got with birthright dont really feel like playing them
anime,not_removed,i like how you think
anime,not_removed,you can read the book wich is very good just skip the book of metro it isnt worth your time
anime,not_removed,obligatory dynasty warriorsrotk anime theres a bunch of rotk anime just none of them are any good p
anime,not_removed,problem is that it cant be adapted as a tv anime without ruining the story and less people would buy an ova series i believe
anime,not_removed,nope id feel obligated to watch it again anyway and ive had enough saya no uta to satisfy one lifetime do not want never again
anime,not_removed,i think thats fine the world of league of legends is fleshed out without an overarching plot its just descriptions of character backstories and places so an anime adaptation could do a lot of different possible things for a story if kancolle and bahamut can get anime so can league
anime,not_removed,i wonder who could voice act am
anime,not_removed,as far as i know there is
anime,not_removed,you know it has one right and one for if im not mistaken
anime,not_removed,oh man that would be amazing just seeing the ship internals being shown would be so awesome much less crew
anime,not_removed,id give my left nut for two more seasons of nep
anime,not_removed,exactly my thoughts an artsy short form of shadow of the colossus would be amazing the budget saved on voice actors would go towards making the animation and landscapes as beautiful as they were in the game
anime,not_removed,with none of the fan songs none of the memes no characters from the fighting games and all the art done by zun himself
anime,not_removed,isnt there already a film
anime,not_removed,oh please i would prefer not having a layton anime never than having one like the aa adaption
anime,not_removed,tloz maybe when links says something else than hyaaa haayaaaa haaa
anime,not_removed,oh hey i have this game never got around to play it would you recommend
anime,not_removed,just the sheer amount of characters introduced would be hilarious to see well people sure laughed when mayoiga did it
anime,not_removed,i find bioshock to be really hard to adapt considering the whole silent protagonist thing and how the player character and their actions are weaved into the narrative would you kindly
anime,not_removed,actually there was an anime movie based on bayonetta bloody fate no idea if it was good or not though
anime,not_removed,what is the name of this pokemon manga i cant find it
anime,not_removed,what happens in the manga
anime,not_removed,what is the name of this pokemon manga i cant find it
anime,not_removed,golden sun are my favorite jrpg ever i think it would be easy to adapt them to anime
anime,not_removed,golden sun was probably my my favorite game on the gba with pokemon
anime,not_removed,it is my fav ff i could see rydia becoming the waifu of the season edit i meant like hestia rem etc i would never change my waifu
anime,not_removed,yeah i liked a lot the movie thats why i think a anime could work
anime,not_removed,httpsmyoutubecomwatchvnbmkfgjjog
anime,not_removed,i will check it thx
anime,not_removed,thats interesting i didnt know about it but it has a manga which i think would be easy to adapt i dont know how good it is though
anime,not_removed,but i want an adaption of the games not a side story like the movie
anime,not_removed,i found translated roms of mother and for gba and i played them with my phone but unfortunately i couldnt find any of earthbound yuishrug
anime,not_removed,is it really like rezero from my impression on this sub it seems like a best girl contest with a steins gate feel in a fantasy setting dark souls was very influenced by berserk you can definitely see the similarities between the two i wouldnt change a thing about either speaking for the manga version of berserk ofc
anime,not_removed,no just no
anime,not_removed,i safecalled that atleast someone gonna comment it but i mean something just as hopeless and dark as dark souls subaru is more or less a hero and theres hope but i want an animesetting in a hopeless world
anime,not_removed,as long as it isnt why not
anime,not_removed,always using the most recent weapontool you got isnt that creative imo
anime,not_removed,people will become more obsessive over the shipping in this than peridot
anime,not_removed,go one better agarest which generation had the best canon matchup also did they actually get the best stats
anime,not_removed,i mean they could just leave everybody unpaired except for chrom who has a canon pairing anyway although we wouldnt get to see best daughteru morgan that way
anime,not_removed,ive picked all of them and im praying as much as i can
anime,not_removed,best girls lucina and severa alright darktenshidt lets fuck be friends
anime,not_removed,fates is one of the rare srories that would actually be better as one route
anime,not_removed,best girls lucina and severa incredible amazing top tier taste rigth there
anime,not_removed,the jugdral and tellius fire emblem games have some fantastic world building you shoud try those games if you want some really good world building and gameplay youd have to play those in order and it may take a while but its absolutely worth it
anime,not_removed,i think that title belongs to zone of the enders the second runner
anime,not_removed,metal gear solid man
anime,not_removed,devil may cry
anime,not_removed,asuras wrath would like a word with you
anime,not_removed,the only problem would be showing the main character ever
anime,not_removed,and a soundtrack like would be amazing
anime,not_removed,i just want more soundtrack by revosound horizon
anime,not_removed,is the plot point youre talking about s when airy betrays you
anime,not_removed,every other episode can be a video of vaatis lore series so people can understand
anime,not_removed,yeah i know just a fanmade anime still cool though
anime,not_removed,im thinking instead of a fulllength show itd be a bunch of shorts with narration from ingame and a silent protagonist exploring the world and dying over and over as he gradually becomes a hollow himself itd be more about worldbuilding than moving a plot but its something
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,yeah cant really remember all the gameplay but i still remember it had an amazing story its always hard to animate detective stuff because the anime tend to skip a lot of the parts
anime,not_removed,ghost trick is one of those rare cases where its story cannot be told in any form besides a video game its so unique in that regards that i actually based a jc lit essay on it
anime,not_removed,not only that they can tie red alert and generals too then we would see the true yuri in action
anime,not_removed,yeah but theres a core story which you get through playing the game and realistically it would be the pacifist run
anime,not_removed,would much prefer a faithful anime adaptation of personally i would want an anime of disgaea the most my favorite of the bunch
anime,not_removed,id love to see it done properly
anime,not_removed,i did not know i wanted an anime from blizzard this badly xd
anime,not_removed,tracer best girl
anime,not_removed,its been a really long time since wow tho
anime,not_removed,heres hoping considering how poorly wow did in domestic theatres and despite it raking in big cash in china it didnt actually make that big a profit video game movie adaptations have rarely made it i would pay premiere ticket money to see the overwatch movie though it has a very pixar vibe to it
anime,not_removed,ok sry
anime,not_removed,the author is a dick the games work as the sequel to the saga without any trouble hes just mad he signed for a flat rate instead of percentage check out his interview at polcon his ignorance is off the charts
anime,not_removed,yeah i have to agree sotc only works when you are playing the protagonist being a viewer watching the protagonist ride around exploring and wordlessly battling colossi wouldnt be nearly as engaging when youre no longer in control and adding in more charactersdialogue would take away a core element of sotcs style
anime,not_removed,true i have yet to play any official one but the old pc fan game was awesome
anime,not_removed,were watching you scum
anime,not_removed,really you wouldicus
anime,not_removed,not really in mw characters represent more of a thugs and you could actually do a proper story about a guy who wants his car back and his to climb the ladder gets into trouble with cops animated pursuit would be amazing too i mean with this you could probably do something like durarara where there is a lot of characters clashing with each one plotting and so on
anime,not_removed,it cant be said enough ee is literally an anime protagonist
anime,not_removed,esports players everywhere always say an esports anime should happen smash bros players especially seem to love the idea
anime,not_removed,itd be great if they did it like baccanodrrr
anime,not_removed,lanaya
anime,not_removed,time to seek it so
anime,not_removed,storywise i thought they were all pretty lackluster but i can say that conquest does a lot better of a job in the gameplay department the maps are some of the most creative in the fire emblem series in general id say
anime,not_removed,ive played both birthright and conquest and id say conquest has a much better story to it so i would pick the latter to be adapted if i had the choice
anime,not_removed,thanks
anime,not_removed,i think ill get it if i see it
anime,not_removed,i think that an adaptation could be possible s the sex scenes could be implied with sound and then a shot of them lying beside each other in bed under the sheetthe rape scene could also be implied with the monster man ripping sayas clothes and then we could have keep the shot focused on fuminori and his expression as he enters the house along with sound telling us whats going on it would definitely be a hit or miss show but with a good team i think it would be really good
anime,not_removed,i could understand you because in times out of the adaptation would be botched and wed end up with something saya no uta fans would hate and something new people wouldnt understand but i havent had enough of saya no uta if a show came even close to it im sure i would love it
anime,not_removed,no characters from the fighting games nah man the fighting game characters are all good suika has dug her spot in the series and kokoro and tenshi are great characters
anime,not_removed,yep thats it done by pa works too
anime,not_removed,or it could be something like pokemon origins where its a short mini series
anime,not_removed,its a massively underrated game i highly recommend it
anime,not_removed,mayoiga got nothing on collectible characters
anime,not_removed,its pokemon adventures in english and pokemon special when looking for scanlations or the japanese version either version is a good read though there is some censoring of the art done in the english version though if the english print is the copy you read first you wont notice it or if you marathon both in separate spurts theres enough chapters that you might not even notice the censorship unless its pointed out to you ucreatethecontroversy pinging you for your benefit too
anime,not_removed,pokemon adventures
anime,not_removed,similar to the games each region has a different protagonist i havent read it myself yet but i also heard it has a darker storyline
anime,not_removed,basically the manga is better than any pkmn game anime or movie it adapts all the games more or less changing the protagonist every region
anime,not_removed,s death of pokemoncharacters lots of likeable protagonist you dont stick with one protagonist for ever everyone has his own goal like being pokemon master catching all the pokemon and so on you also find the reason out why red was in mt silver in the games kinda related
anime,not_removed,earthbound is for the snes
anime,not_removed,imagine re zero but when you die only the obstacles are reset people who you pissed off last life are still pissed at you but the monsters in your way are back and healed up
anime,not_removed,dark souls was very influenced by berserk i dont think gritty fantasy settings with demons was created by berserk
anime,not_removed,yesat the fact that the world is so hard that you have to reincarnated a bazzilion times to figure out what to do nextand add the realistic fact that reincarnated need to dieand that can be trauma as hell
anime,not_removed,thats where the anime has the advantage the gameplay needs to be that way for the convenience of the player and its usually non linear so they have to make sure you have the right weapon to beat the boss the anime would be free from that
anime,not_removed,thats the spirit
anime,not_removed,id rather be friends ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
anime,not_removed,fates is one of the rare stories that would be better having never left a rejected draft
anime,not_removed,you mean incredibly basic taste
anime,not_removed,only ever have him onscreen in a full flight suit
anime,not_removed,bravely default has one of my all time favorite videogame soundtracks
anime,not_removed,s im referring to how you reset the world several times and have to do things over and over again it is a haruhi reference
anime,not_removed,just make it afro samurai with a crow and an undead make the crow sombre and put a kalafina song in the opening deen saves anime
anime,not_removed,nbsp i thought pro vas were expensive how the fuck do fanimes afford hiring their voices also why are so many fanimes coming out in when touhou began getting cannibalised by kancolle from
anime,not_removed,that might work i think it would be a little disappointing to me personally ive never been a huge fun if the short minute stuff
anime,not_removed,so good but for real if they didnt use tatakai for the beat fight it would be a crime against humanity
anime,not_removed,tanya x yuri best ship and now that ive thought about it it would actually be great to see yuris psi powers in anime form
anime,not_removed,the ending of the pacifist run entirely depends on the time travel mechanic though flowey tricking you into replaying so he could steal everyones souls in one fell swoop you could arguably skip over omega flowey and go straight to asriel but that lessens both the impact of the reveal and the mystery of other parts of the story true lab chara in a pretty significant way i still think that the looped story is such a core part of the game that it would be disingenuous to call something undertale without it
anime,not_removed,nanos saviour of song actually fits well with the kind of story of overwatch imo
anime,not_removed,wealth beyond measure outlander
anime,not_removed,whatever he does in the first episode he fucks it up hard probably feeding
anime,not_removed,finding dudes to establish a club nth worked together to enter the nationals kicked because of retarded character tropes realized his tomodachis and made another club with them speed gaming won with nakama spirit bomb yeap sounds good to me
anime,not_removed,birthright for me just seemed written with plan in mind they pretty much made up the story on the spot s like one character goes missing then you travel across half the world without it ever being said that the missing character is actually there once you find him you directly go to the villains capital and then the last few chapters are literally like your party walks feet and runs into another enemy
anime,not_removed,the author published it on the internet for free you can go to the metro subreddit and find it in the sidebar
anime,not_removed,i played that game in one night all endings at like in the morning i have no idea how i can even still stand lolis in shows
anime,not_removed,thats the joke most of the things people love about touhou are fanmade things the fighting games included
anime,not_removed,oh yeah i remember the pokeball thing in the kanto series where blue hides them in her clothes it was cut out in the english version iirc
anime,not_removed,i have finished and have on hold someday i want to finish all of them but i cant find the time to do it ffiv is what a coincidence my fav game only surpassed by ocarina of time golden sun and mgs
anime,not_removed,actually i found a translated rom for snes but what i dont have is a good emularor of snes for android
anime,not_removed,the creator has stated on many occasions how big of an influence berserk was its not his only influence but it is one of the biggest ones there are quite a few fairly direct berserk references as well
anime,not_removed,thats not really true imo there are tons of games with comparable puzzles and there are ones where you need to use all of your available tools depending on the situation zelda just doesnt do it to ensure people dont get frustrated because they dont figure out what to do based on that a zelda anime would need to keep that aspect to be true to the game
anime,not_removed,fistbump
anime,not_removed,fates is one of the rare stories that actually doesnt have any positive characteristics
anime,not_removed,you mean incredibly bad taste
anime,not_removed,i mean i know people loved hiroyuki sawanos work in attack on titan and elsewhere but did people not notice the people who made that memetic title theme werent the ones who did the soundtrack the soundtrack shows revosound horizon didnt just get lucky that is really solid and id love to see them do another
anime,not_removed,s to be fair things actually happen differently each time you reset the world and you get more insight into the enemies characters from what i know about the endless eight it was exactly the same thing all the time wasnt it
anime,not_removed,touhou still has an healthy large community because its also popular overseas so people are still interested in it
anime,not_removed,lmao these references in first link
anime,not_removed,kancolle cant kill the
anime,not_removed,i never had to restart the game to get the pacifist run though and theres a ton of ways they can just put the save function into the style of it id go full kill la kill and ham it up
anime,not_removed,ee is subaru
anime,not_removed,old with samsung pls that the dream
anime,not_removed,but the fighting games arent fanmade zun wrote the stories of those afaik
anime,not_removed,well s kogas arbok was going to use acid in charmeleons trainer who i dont remember now if was blue or green
anime,not_removed,charmeleon beheads a pokemon you got my attention
anime,not_removed,works fine in my experience
anime,not_removed,you mean tastes incredibly bad
anime,not_removed,s stuff changes each time but on some loops is extremely minimal in haruhi the animation was completely different each time and the story might have been told slightly differently but overall it was the same so almost the same
anime,not_removed,i mean im sure more than of fan base doesnt even care for games but characters its one of this perfect waifu material games where game is only popular thanks to fanbase
anime,not_removed,the pacifist ending should be impossible on the very first playthrough the true lab wont open so the issue of how to work the save into another medium is actually something ive thought about before strangely enough the main issue and the reason i said before i cant think of a way to work it in without it feeling like it came out of nowhere is that in a noninteractive medium theyd just have to say oh yeah the main character can time travel lol theres no reason for a regular human child to be able to go back in time but the game had a reason and thats because it was the player character there was a sort of horror to how the game did it because players are used to having a sort of invincibility by being able to correct their mistakes but then flowey reveals that he remembers everything regardless of reloading you cant really translate that feeling into a noninteractive medium because you cant recreate the sensation of something that used to make you feel secure getting ripped away
anime,not_removed,geback geback geback geback yourstickyourstickyourstick drop your stick furion can you tp top furion can you tp top
anime,not_removed,youre not wrong theyre a coproduction with twilight frontier but consider that most of the art game design music etc is those guys and not zun the real point im trying to make is that most of what people really truly love about touhou isnt actually made by team shanghai alice now i have opinions about the shmups because im huge into that genre but i hardly know anybody that plays those outside of the shmupping communities
anime,not_removed,if you are talking about them in the tower when koga was watching from a distance from a device im fairly certain it was blue
anime,not_removed,i will check it later then thanks
anime,not_removed,dont underestimate the series as being just waifubait though the world of gensokyo is amazing and has a lot of really cool lore and im pretty sure those that dont care about the games stopped caring about the series around when touhou was at peak
anime,not_removed,you do have to beat asgore and omega flowey but if you followed the pacifist route up to that point it just puts you at your last save and allows you to complete it without a full reset i agree though undertale is probably the worst video game to adapt to anime
anime,not_removed,i can understand that its true that a lot of people do recognize touhou for the fanmade things in my case though i ridiculously love the worldbuilding on its own regardless of the fandom i love how gensokyo is a giant mix of a lot of different east asian traditional folklore and culture while still having some foreign influences like the scarlet devil mansion and the lunar capital
anime,not_removed,yep i meant there i just didnt remember well who was blue and who green i just checked it with my volumes this is a mistake that happens to me more often than i would want to admit teehee
anime,not_removed,youre definitely missing out earthbound is one of my all time favourites it def blows mother out of the water
anime,not_removed,the name swap thing is confusing as hell
anime,not_removed,the male rival you remember from the games or anime gary is green the mangaoriginal character that wasnt in the games because gen i didnt have a female protagonist is blue that is unless you read a translation that switched the names green and blue because we had redblue versions instead of redgreen versions
anime,not_removed,i will definitely play it i just dont know when
anime,not_removed,thats exactly my problem i know in japan they had redgreen instead of redblue so i dont know how to call him so at the end of the day i just think of them as red the guy who isnt actually gary and the girl
anime,not_removed,shits tight yo
anime,not_removed,amazing work
anime,not_removed,i see weve fallen back into shaft production hell
anime,not_removed,this plus march comes in like a lion is making me rather nervous but at least they are delaying them until they can produce an acceptable product it would be terrible if they pumped out a halffinished episode
anime,not_removed,its happening after two episodes this time at this rate the next project is going to go into production hell before its announced
anime,not_removed,well theres always the shaft bluray editiontm
anime,not_removed,rip fateextra
anime,not_removed,i kind of wish you guys wouldnt talk over one another since it makes it hard to hear what you have to say i mean its not hard to give each other turns right
anime,not_removed,seconding akagami and ill also throw in and edit ha take that ukamilny my thanks had an exclamation mark so i win woo im the best around nothings gonna ever keep me down
anime,not_removed,akagami no shirayukihime should be good for you if you liked maidsama
anime,not_removed,which is a nice light romance anime which is a pretty good ecchi romcom
anime,not_removed,plastic memories is a great one mc is does have some bashful moments but its nothing crazy definitely wouldnt call him shy spice and wolf also has a great romantic subplot its not the main focus but progresses well throughout the anime gosick is another one with a romantic subplot the romance is a bit slower than in spice and wolf but has a much more satisfying conclusion very satisfying in fact if youd like some comedic focus with your romance then working and kawai complex are both very funny kawai complex doesnt have a very good romantic conclusion though and the mc is probably the shyest out of eveyrthing ive listed but the sweet moments are very enjoyable
anime,not_removed,nagi no asakura and white album spring to mind in having rather forwardoutgoing mcs
anime,not_removed,you might like my little monster the protagonist is quiet and focused on her studies but shes not shy skip beat has a protagonist who is definitely not shy im not sure how far the anime advances into the romance aspect of the story though kare kanos protagonist isnt shy either edit its a movie not a series but howls moving castle is another good romance anime it seems somewhat implied that the main character may have been shy in the past or at the beginning of the film but she stops giving a shit pretty much as soon as the plot gets going

anime,not_removed,thanks
anime,not_removed,thanks
anime,not_removed,i believe theres a lion dance in the first episode of but its been a while so im not totally sure
anime,not_removed,do you mean like a whole anime about lion dancing because i havent heard of one but if you just want a scene then just off the top of my head theres a small lion dancing scene in hotarubi no mori e
anime,not_removed,well a space lion but not
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,it aired years ago just wondering if they plan on making one i havent heard anything myself around here in the community unfortunately i havent read the source material so somebody much more knowledgeable than i will have to tell you if there is even enough material left to animate the remainder
anime,not_removed,very unlikely the manga ended recently so theres a lot less reason to promote the source material slim chance of it being picked up as a passion project but even then it didnt sell well in japan i wouldnt count on it
anime,not_removed,this submission has been removed threads consisting of a direct question may be removed once a proper answer has been provided this is not a violation of subreddit rules its subreddit cleanup have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,anyone know what show this guy was talking about from the comments it sounds like it came out in late or
anime,not_removed,well i remember back when it was airing people were complaining about how they adapted chapters in episodes just checked right now and it has chapters so from those numbers i think theres plenty of material for season or even
anime,not_removed,the free spot should be sao
anime,not_removed,does the get enough cosplay to be its own square certainly aot sao and fma would be more common than the toaru series
anime,not_removed,oi thats a ghoul not a vampire
anime,not_removed,this is one of the shows im really looking forward to next season
anime,not_removed,this is pretty much the only show nothing else interests me from the get go and there are tons of sequels for showsthat i never watched nor plan on watching
anime,not_removed,fanart
anime,not_removed,and our now we know why there are two triangles in the delta logo and messerkanamearad had a field day with this episode late subs encouraged everyone to creatively interpret the raw as hard as they possibly could though primarily focusing on freyja losing to mirage savvy viewers pointed out that with other notable characters in previous macross shows
anime,not_removed,got a fantastic messer based episode which gave a lot more characterization for him along with mad shipping now with him and kaname also learned more about kaname as well and had a small snippet of her backstory learned more about fold receptors which were mentioned early on and how the walkure and why most of the delta squadron were possibly immune to the winderemere song along with confirmation of the fold bacteria from frontier being involved with the var syndrome also we had out first strong steps for the main love triangle with freyja getting very intrigued with the alone time mirage and hayate have been having leading to some minor misunderstandings it was resolved rather quickly but freyjas feelings are definitely out there now overall a great episode and had plenty of vf dogfighting insert song webms episode httpslnsteamymoedniutnwebm httpsmymixtapemoewmdsscwebm httpsmymixtapemoeietmxywebm httpsmymixtapemoeqdvbvvwebm httpsmymixtapemoetwxauywebm episode httpsmymixtapemoebweksjwebm httpsmymixtapemoeuwgclnwebm episode httpsmymixtapemoedzijftwebm httpsmymixtapemoelclsuxwebm episode httpsmymixtapemoetaerukwebm httpsmymixtapemoezuyyvuwebm httpsmymixtapemoeblxpeswebm httpsmymixtapemoenlbuzewebm episode httpsmymixtapemoescxawdwebm httpsmymixtapemoefnkbnlwebm episode httpsmymixtapemoehnxqlwwebm episode httpsmymixtapemoenbgnfawebm episode httpsmymixtapemoefkoyylwebm httpsmymixtapemoeiinbppwebm httpsmymixtapemoebfxyzvwebm episode httpsmymixtapemoejwroahwebm

anime,not_removed,everyone is kind of a jerk to remind poor freyja that she is dying in like years
anime,not_removed,was it necessary to subtitle messers scream anyways choo choo all aboard ss kaname x messer
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,i get to post right before going to work the day is only hours long i do have to sleep sometime today on httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmuedkqbmboq leading to the usual catapult out of bed leading to my thinking that httpiimgurcomedkgsozjpg httpiimgurcomckavnkkjpg httpiimgurcomtrlpobkjpg httpiimgurcomztwtnewjpg confirming things such as the varwaterapples connection and httpiimgurcomsaxvrmzjpg turns out that they were auditioning for the receptor factor as well as singing ability while were at it makinas pants are really really low have they checked out his necklace also httpiimgurcomwjqhgkbjpg httpiimgurcomjvcivqvjpg httpiimgurcomicxqfakjpg httpiimgurcomnrofeysjpg httpsstreamablecomsjrq httpiimgurcomuuxoftijpg httpsmymixtapemoevhldiswebm maybe they need an underwaterthemed song or spock needs to mindmeld with the whales or they need freyja to really care about the situation but death isnt on the line here and yes mikumos weird hair is sticking out of her helmet im surprised that its not ika musumeing in the water httpiimgurcomspjrpwbjpg httpiimgurcomjxrzwbcjpg httpiimgurcomwqwkxgijpg its still slightly disturbing that half of delta is cannonfodder for one guy on the other hand you dont have to worry about having a tail light if youre bicycling home httpiimgurcomyicxwvujpg and mirages concerns in there somewhere httpiimgurcomxjawritjpg which theyre going to have a lot of to spare if apple exports have been prohibited though lloyd is pretty confident about the durability of the work theyve already done proactive that keith what about the part where neither of us can outfly you httpiimgurcomzvgsnfnjpg httpiimgurcomszncomhjpg httpiimgurcomivxyorzjpg hemera is the mythological female counterpart to aether the other carrier httpsmymixtapemoewaldmwwebm im just going to complain a little bit here that the series has only had this one piece as battle music i suppose i was spoiled by frontier having a few different musical background pieces in addition to the fights that were backed up by songs httpsstreamablecomvsrd well they did it with handdrawn animation too it just took a lot more time so often they wouldnt bother httpiimgurcomxsgywqrjpg the basic walküredelta uniform doesnt look that bad really also they could have just sung this its not like messer has enough eyes to watch the music video while hes flying httpiimgurcomdgfckzpjpg httpsmymixtapemoejwksjowebm all these seriesmovie finalelevel items going off way early as if there werent enough death flags now httpsstreamablecomwyof httpiimgurcomuruhdjxjpg httpiimgurcomdozahbvjpg httpiimgurcomhegmfkcjpg httpiimgurcomjznxuxwjpg funny thing we all suspected that kaname had a crush on the guy but apparently she wasnt able to pierce his inscrutability i mean var messer is a flying macross plus reference so the rest of the linkages are just sitting there in the meta meanwhile lady ms continued involvement in everything is mentioned once again httpiimgurcomrlkaxmjjpg when the piano started here it sounded briefly like aimo which was incredibly confusing you want a goofy messer face httpiimgurcomlmircygjpg freyja got messer to smile but im not shipping them continued in a comment below
anime,not_removed,so i just noticed or maybe its been in previous episodes this is the first time im seeing it though pretty interesting
anime,not_removed,when messer was relapsing during the fight i thought dang var gives you mad gains
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomoidoilcjpg another episode another kickass aerial fight another its interesting that up until this point no one in the hayate triangle seemed to have romantic feelings towards one another they were just chilling around and only now it seems like freyja realized that she might like hayate the ball is in your court mirage httpiimgurcomdpcuelvjpg
anime,not_removed,hey from this episode i will also follow the macross delta discussions while at first i didnt pick up this anime for the genres not fitting what i usually like never watched any macross before neither i gave it a try after hearing the positive opinion of the viewers and im honestly pretty amazed the story is pretty good the characters are fantastic loving freyja and hayate in special and damn the songs so yeah if you hace place for another one here i will glady join the macross fanbase great episode we learned more about kanade and messer they must end together while freyja was adorably worried about a possible hayate x mirage relationship im honestly terrified everytime them mention the windemereans life expectancy shes nearly in the middle of her life years is just so little so cruel when compared to everyone else qq
anime,not_removed,tell me if anything more has been ticked off httpimgurcomhawdwdt
anime,not_removed,another great episode some of my ships getting some nice progress best part has to be best characters usually wear ties
anime,not_removed,well im just glad they eventually did a kaname more or less episode i was starting to think she didnt have a clear role within walkure and that she was a bit useless to the point i even forgot what her name was and if she even was a band member to begin with you spend so much more time seeing her outside of her band outfit discussing data shit with arad that i couldnt help but think she was just some kind of manager with this episode though her presence in the band is a bit more justified and itd be interesting if we get to know even more about her since her past as an idol and temporary frontwoman for walküre and her saving messer would make for a nice backstory for both messer and her nice episode in the end freyja is still a cutie and mikumo is still the same pseudophilosophical front for walküre i really dont know where they want to go with her being so damn mysterious i hope they wont fuck that up
anime,not_removed,i think it needs to be made clear that we i think that fancy typesetting is incredibly pointless and a waste of time feel free to grab subs from other groups– oh wait lol as always httpimgurcommbtrplz
anime,not_removed,i really wonder who lady m is i hope its mylene from macross its been only like years since macross its possible shes also the only one who has experience being on an actual team focused on fighting aliens and shit enemies with the power of song
anime,not_removed,man i love those take offs man i want a vf ok i take back all the bad shit about messer in the first couple of episodes dude is a fucking boss on who the fuck wins that in the air kaname x messer i ship that erm extra random sidenote i was just walking through the web when i uh noticed a doujin here and there of macross delta already just soyou know if anyone needed extra sources for research and stuff
anime,not_removed,im so hyped for axia and kaname taking lead on a song the snippet in this episode wasnt enough
anime,not_removed,so basically when everyone is fighting for their life and shouting over the comms messer spends that time jamming to his favorite idols song that sounds more like something hayate would do honestly that white knight vs messer fight was really nicely done always nice to see my favorite songs returning in slightly different formats
anime,not_removed,episode someone in a pointed out that messer was doing that weird thing where he grabs his wrist the place where he wears his bracelet during a previous episode you cant see it very well if you dont have the raw so is blushed mirage from the preview the red ears are way too adorable
anime,not_removed,sweet jesusyamato messer httpiimgurcombuplbnngifv
anime,not_removed,ok episode first episode where no one screamed fuck messer
anime,not_removed,the next episode preview makes it seem like mirage is reacting to the arad x messer action closet fujoshi
anime,not_removed,one of my complaints with this show is how in battles besides things being shot pretty much nothing happens most of the time noone even gets damagedcertainly noone important and even more rarely does someone get shot down
anime,not_removed,messer and kaname must end together cant wait for the next episode and hopefully kanames solo great episode as usual
anime,not_removed,now that windermere know that the ragnan ruins are still active they might aim their brainwashing there while the delta squadron are away possibly being another vordor
anime,not_removed,umm did mirages seacat pet just crawl away saying kappa kappa kappa
anime,not_removed,dat blush in preview shot almost knocked me out so cute i expect freya discovering in the next episode that they were only worried about messer and not dating yet
anime,not_removed,messer and keith has the best rivalry in this series right now
anime,not_removed,finally i was losing all hope
anime,not_removed,so i was watching the raws yesterday whilst understanding none of it and thoughtcould mikumo be windermerean
anime,not_removed,i think this ep ep finally pegged some emotional urgency that the rest of the eps were lacking considering mf got there around ep im hoping the best emotional singing will start to pop up soon
anime,not_removed,god im late but i hope they dont kill of messer i saw so many death flags though the disease is gonna end up him i pray im wrong though messer and kaname and hayate and freyja belong together and hayate is getting alot better as a piolet shits about to go down
anime,not_removed,im gonna come right out and say it fuck messer he shouldve removed himself from active duty after the training exercise because not only did he put himself in danger he also put his teammates and walkure including kaname his crush in danger thank god they didnt have the prince sing the wind song otherwise messer wouldve turned against delta platoon and as we saw earlier with the training exercise not even when it was against could they take him down
anime,not_removed,i see why this shows discussions keep getting smaller and smaller this show isnt very good
anime,not_removed,i like how he went out and bought an entire music device just for that one song thats like if i went and bought an ipod solely to play love story by taylor swift
anime,not_removed,can you just imagine for a moment the shit storm that would break if the mid season climax comes around and out of fucking nowhere and solar aquarion bursts out of the planet
anime,not_removed,that last one is fake that scene she is talking about her rune episode but yeah they are kind of hinting at that its not like anyone really wins in the love triangle in macross they just lose less
anime,not_removed,runes can also change colours
anime,not_removed,triggered by that kbbq comment
anime,not_removed,bokura no senjou progression freyja good freyja and mikuno great freyja and mikuno and kaname out of this league gg macross
anime,not_removed,i cant wait for the axia song performance next episode damn that teaser i hope its kanames solo performance
anime,not_removed,goodness gracious macross give us the flacs for bokura no senjou already just let me throw my money at you
anime,not_removed,oh god kanames moero moero is so good
anime,not_removed,fukfukfukfukfuk
anime,not_removed,i am conflicted what about keith
anime,not_removed,also shut your fucking traps
anime,not_removed,was it necessary to subtitle messers scream probably not but to be fair not everyone who watches anime can hear and subtitling those things are useful for that small subset of the population
anime,not_removed,continued from a comment above random bonus that i made for because i was distracted this afternoon related bonus cover of bokura no senjou apologies i had an extra day to screw around with screenshots so this post is waaaaaay up there in length i even got rid of some bonus clips of terrestrial fighter launches from all of the macross series that was a lot of exposition headlining the episode people who get var apparently will remain vulnerable to relapse of it since it cant be completely gotten rid of windermere came up with their own clever plan to combine apples and water to produce that other chemical which also increases susceptibility to var in combination with the song of wind the concerts suppress its appearance since they cant totally eliminate it though they have the best scheme for driving up concert ticket sales ever though i doubt that theyre doing this for a real profit so maybe theyre just taking a cut of the proceeds from light stick sales fold receptor factor allows for a defense against the effects of the fold bacteria and is something screened for in the walküre selection process secondarymedia information the ongoing delta prequel manga serial has revealed that var initially appeared in some large animals in along with some hints about its origin lets just say that fold bacteria is probably not a coincidence theres also been a few images of the very first walküre member from around that time messer did contract var syndrome two years ago and had that moment in the flashback but kaname as a part of early walküre brought him back and hes been using her old song as a way to maintain control of it staying close to walküre and kaname helps kaname nohitwonder idol was discovered to have a fold receptor factor and recruited into walküre shortly to have her starring role eclipsed by mikumo resulting in her shifting to management welcome to the japanese pop idol mill itll cut you lloyd and keiths quiet power struggle continues lloyds apparent willingness to be patient matches his seeminglylongterm plan to date while keith is more windermerean and is already working on a new scheme windermere has made significant gains while theyve been tolerating each other but its fairly certain that theyll turn on each other when the time is right protoculture ruins whatever ragnas got it has some deep connection to the planet itself as did all the other ones and the knights have information on it now amusingly walküres first attempt to stimulate the ruins is handled as a minor afterthought despite containing a fullgroup version of giraffe blues their inability to reach the ruins seems to bother mikumo but as usual the show isnt revealing anything but tiny teases of what she might be thinking if what we get even counts as information obvious implication is that theyll set off the ruins using heinz which is something that deltawalküre havent quite finished the connection with though we had it figured out in episode the ruins need a windermerean singer to work songs on repeat this is now the fourth version of giraffe blues miya mikumo freyja walküre and the third version of bokura no senjou freyja solo mikumofreyja duet walküre still not up to the repetition levels of watashi no kare wa pilot or shao pai long the inevitable comparison to aimo aimo also had several different arrangements and delta is keeping up with that as well as using more songs so still a point for delta there the mentioned that they were expecting the song to switch to axia when kaname called out to messer and i was expecting that as well the seriess pattern so far suggests that theyre not quite done with it yet as it was the mix of bokura no senjou that was used did feature kaname more prominently than usual though its still a piece dominated by mikumo and freyja a full performance of axia will also complete all of the songs on the first vocal album might this series actually reach three vocal albums by the time its finished the triangle in the room the triangle and the other triangle miragehayatefreyja sets itself up in an animetropish way with the bridge bunnies getting the wrong if obvious idea and running with it causing freyja to freak out for reasons that she cant quite understand meanwhile mirage and hayate are teaming up well even if this little partnership started off for messers sake the podcast notes that hayate is in oblivious middle position usually reserved for the woman in a triangle hes not quite a male harem lead at least both the hayatefreyja and hayatemirage relationships are anchored on partnerships hayate flies at his best with freyjas fold wave assistance and freyja performs best when shes trying to help someone which has mostly been hayate so far but is starting to branch out hayate needed mirage to learn how to fly and fight and mirage is broadening her flying abilities by teaming up with hayate or at least there have been flashes of it in episodes and i could argue that these dependencies may not be bidirectionally balanced but the partnership angle still provides a good foundation for all three characters relationships compared to the flimsier shes hot or im your biggest fan starters im hoping that actual communication between the characters will rescue the nascent love triangle from the usual genre traps at least freyja was able to see that mirage had snuck off to have a conversation with both hayate and messer instead of trysting with hayate as she was suspecting all episode the little scene between messer and freyja gives me a little hope ranka beach is such a blatant injoke as theyve used it so far that im guessing that the writers arent just going to have ranka freyja get depressed and summon a giant bug horde infect everyone with var but will actually summon her genki and challenge the situation as best as a middleagedwoman can then theres messerkanamearad depending on exactly where kanames position on things is it could go a couple of different ways most of which remind me of macross plus there sure are a lot of little nods to plus in this episode arent there hopefully the next episode gives us additional background on arad which would greatly help solidify what seems like a good subplot arad and kaname seem mostly friendly at this point but the bridge bunnies have been shipping them mentioned in the podcast messer reminds the others to kill him if he turns but the only person who might be able to do that based on what weve seen so far is arad or maybe keith aero windermere could but unless keith was just shamming long enough that the twins could complete the intelligencegathering mission unlikely given his intensity to date it looks like even a varaffected messer can manage at least a draw with the blonde one the finale brings up an inevitable bugfeature in having a large number of characters fighting each other that its easy to lose track of some of the characters along the way in the case of this episode the keithmesser dogfight is meant to be the centerpiece so having everyone else drop out of sight for a while is intended additionally to demonstrate how the twins were able to lurk out of sight to conduct their reconnaisance though while having supporting characters disappear offscreen for a while is inevitable im not sure that delta has given us a good wholeteam showcase display yet the pattern to date is that keith and messer will duel and become totally irrelevant to the rest of the fight chuck and arad will each get one brief scene to shine and then simply not be seen again for rest of the fight and the remaining the time primarily goes to hayate for a topbilled character mirage hasnt had too many chances to demonstrate her abilities aside from brief moments with hayate its worse for the aerial knights theres the aforementioned keith versus messer and bogue gets a contractuallyobligated bogue rage attack when he appears but after that the others are hardly there this is why chuck and cassim are really high up on each teams death pool rankings delta is exhibiting a pattern where episodes will have a breather front half and then an action back half though the intensity of the back half will vary fullout war in and smaller personal engagements in and barely counts its not quite totally episodic that way and contained an actual cliffhanger arc episode was a little more intense in its front half by focusing on messers significant problems but danced on the edge of relationship comedy by firing up the triangle before having a mediumlevel final fight the next episode will tell if the main plot really is taking a little breather or if it reverts to pattern and hits us with largescale developments again though character episodes arent bad when there are this many characters and delta continues to move the plot forward in its way while doing this weeks focus on messer
anime,not_removed,we tested your apples and theyre set to evil while were at it makinas pants are really really low what about the part where neither of us can outfly you none of the redshirts explode this time goddamn it man i exhausted my laughter quota for the day and its only am
anime,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomwjqhgkbjpg i guess mylene didnt pass any of that along then the one thing i have noticed is that the only difference between mirage and the other jenius girls is that her ears are longerpointier so maybe she can hear enemies better hah
anime,not_removed,i love those dogfights messers cobra was fucking sick i know hayate does stuff like that here and there but messer does it on the daily dude is straight up ace he deserves that grim reaper nickname
anime,not_removed,in case you forgot back in episode messer told hayate that dueling was stupid but of course thats all he and keith have ever done i totally expect one of them to die to some random third wheel even better if its faceless grunt though it does seem keith is the one shooting messer all the flirtatious smiles rather then the other way round
anime,not_removed,regarding the gori gori comment im startin to think its something like charlie browns aaaaaaaaaugh of frustration
anime,not_removed,a nod to macross frontier
anime,not_removed,indeed this has been in previous episodes
anime,not_removed,it was shown before its the same beach they always hang around in i like that they reuse the same place since it gives a sense of permanency to the locations in the series
anime,not_removed,tired of working out at the gym get yourself some var today
anime,not_removed,i thought that was the pilot suit tightening up from all of those gs hes pulling
anime,not_removed,does this mean also that people wont like messer when hes hungry too because the hulkrage is obvious
anime,not_removed,freyfrey so cute
anime,not_removed,theres something very amusing in the image of messer just solemnly sitting by the rock thanks for invading my privacy another hilarious expression by freyja shes the queen of expression face i like how hayate and mirages outfits compliment each other they have great taste in fashion keep the shipping chemistry strong like we give a fuck at least they wont be sucked out by the harsh vacuum of space like in previous episode
anime,not_removed,have you tried frontier its just as good
anime,not_removed,kaname arad messer triangle pretty sure we already saw a dyrl reference
anime,not_removed,the bingos op hasnt updated it recently but there was discussion a while back on what should have been ticked off and the general idea was that listen to my song needed to be that exact phrase basarasheryl used i personally think that little exchange between roid and keith didnt really count as infighting though im fairly confident that well see some infighting later in the season they zoomed in on a pineapple salad in thats probably as much of an sdf macross pineapple salad reference as well get speculation may happen next episode given its title is very unlikely as kawamori is unlikely to kill off any marketable character im convinced is true despite kawamoris interview answer stating there are no protodeviln in delta he is not a reliable interviewee mikumos eyes look exactly like sivils and nobody else in the delta cast has this eye shape not to mention there is absolutely no way is waterproof
anime,not_removed,i think making a show about another macross entry could be ticked off too there was some diegetic mention in some previous episodes
anime,not_removed,does messer count as an aerial knight they havent explicitly confessed or anything but ht definitely seems like hes into kaname
anime,not_removed,i mean you wouldnt be wrong about the manager thing since she waskind of still is their manager but yeah no she needed some character time stat and a solo song soon plz
anime,not_removed,and gg notes being savage i look forward to them putting out more of their random opinions every week
anime,not_removed,how did you get that note to show up i only see one sub track on the file and it doesnt have that
anime,not_removed,i keep thinking that too
anime,not_removed,its been only like years since macross macross timeline its years years to frontier then from frontier to delta which would put her somewhere in her early at most if not mylene then miriamilia of course by now shed be somewhere in her or unless its mirages mother seeing as they seem to give m names to the jenius family well aside from mylenes sister that they come across in a side episode in
anime,not_removed,of the possible pastcharacter lady m candidates so far im leaning toward mylene milia already had her multishow reappearance in so mylene could use a turn as you said shes also done exactly this sort of thing before and given that her characterization in is somewhat different from how lady m seems to be described it would be interesting to see any other changes from the intervening years though given the franchises aversion to direct reuse of characters aside from cameos and references she might only appear over the phone
anime,not_removed,my research focuses on certain characters whos in these doujins
anime,not_removed,im also investing a reply for those sources i have seen of makina and reina
anime,not_removed,that actually looks more believable a maneuver considering their vectored thrusters than a
anime,not_removed,macross says screw your aerodynamics
anime,not_removed,vfs flipping the bird to physics since
anime,not_removed,youre not the only one thinking thatcomrade
anime,not_removed,so many death flags messer will end up like focker and mikael at this rate hopefully thats not the case
anime,not_removed,no rune
anime,not_removed,the discussions are about the same as its ever been the sub also came late and it kinda fell under the radar reception on a is at least pretty tolerable compared to rezero which honestly they are pretty bipolar towards
anime,not_removed,i think most people who watch and continue to watch it for the music and visuals its one of those shows where i can shut off my brain and just appreciate how pleasing it is to the senses
anime,not_removed,your retarded this show is actually is very good and the music is too notch
anime,not_removed,you mean people dont do that
anime,not_removed,having never watched aquarion what even was that opening it was like five different series all happening at once
anime,not_removed,one benefit of having an idol group you get to hear many different versions of the song giri giri ai last week also had the other group members be more prominent my playlist is going to be taken over by delta when it comes out
anime,not_removed,i gotta say bokura no senjou has to be my most favorite giri giri ai is probably i love these songs i want their album
anime,not_removed,i think theres another one who sang after kaname probably makina
anime,not_removed,freyja one its inspiring maybe because its the first time i listened the song the duet between freyja and mikumo felt so frontier like and walkure version its just epic
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,if you cant heartheres almost no point in watching a macross
anime,not_removed,i just wanna know what the redshirts were flying
anime,not_removed,that bokura no senjou youtube is there a single damn song in this series that wont make the list of songs i loop over daily maybe the walkure intro song maybe
anime,not_removed,while were at it makinas pants are really really low now that i see it again her pants are low as hell shes getting a little too comfortable
anime,not_removed,mylene has the ears too in a lot of the artwork most of the time there hidden under her hair
anime,not_removed,and so exports of windermerean apples skyrocketed
anime,not_removed,or its his mad gainssssss yeah probably that makes a lot more sense
anime,not_removed,more like hes been lifting gs with those guns maybe it was just the way the animation flowed but it looked to me like his muscles suddenly busted out your explanation makes more sense though
anime,not_removed,is there anything i have to watch before to understand the story i might give it a try
anime,not_removed,i would guess it means the song more likely might as well wait until it happens its pretty much guaranteed
anime,not_removed,dyrl i did the triangle
anime,not_removed,not to mention there is absolutely no way this helmet is waterproof everyone else was underwater too though i updated the pineapple
anime,not_removed,when they make a show they make the whole show
anime,not_removed,aerial knights are the windermereans
anime,not_removed,it appears after ed at the very last frame
anime,not_removed,it would be pretty cool if it was milia but i highly doubt it though since shes a zentradi shouldnt she have a longer lifespan i wish i could find a good place to watch side episodes the only thing i could find was a really old torrent
anime,not_removed,what about myung from plus
anime,not_removed,even if she only appears on the phone once in the entire show if she does end up being lady m i would love it so much though i hope she makes a direct appearance like in one episode hayatamiragefreyja or a combination are called to appear in front of lady m that would be great
anime,not_removed,so far mikumo and makina but seems that someone here said reina too which means im going back in asap
anime,not_removed,yack deculture color me impressed mitsukishock
anime,not_removed,uh no the aerodynamics are fine pilot would be a puddle though
anime,not_removed,theres lots of death flags all over the supporting cast on both sides
anime,not_removed,episode had over episode had episode had episode had and now episode has as of posting this if episode has sub it wouldnt surprise me it is very clearly is dropping off and for good reason i was very excited for this show and after frontier but this show is just honestly closer to bad imo than it is to average
anime,not_removed,youre top
anime,not_removed,well i bought a gaming spec pc to play skyrim thats about the same right
anime,not_removed,i watched it when mtv aired it in my country like a million years ago and im debating if rewatching it or not i remember it as amazing but stil
anime,not_removed,when i first watched frontier i got a playlist of it when i watched love live i got a brand new playlist now watching delta im building a whole new playlist music anime are definitely not good for me
anime,not_removed,many different versions of the song great way to avoid aimo syndrome
anime,not_removed,my playlist is going to be taken over by delta when it comes out same looking forward to seeing multiple versions of the same tracks
anime,not_removed,i know how you feel
anime,not_removed,its one of those songs that just grow on you giri giri ai is that song you love at first glance though
anime,not_removed,op ed and borderline are already out on an ep with instrumental versions the rest should be out fairly soonish
anime,not_removed,july
anime,not_removed,walkure attack is also pretty good
anime,not_removed,that chart is amazing
anime,not_removed,fujoshi bait and totally doing it are perfect
anime,not_removed,this is awesome
anime,not_removed,lloyd and his glasses does it for me
anime,not_removed,that reina x makina is best ship
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,on the other hand though shes clearly compensated for that on the top half and kanames uniform is cut to show her middle also the real tease is mikumo who dresses pretty plainly for someone who likes to wander around stark naked at night
anime,not_removed,oh i know she had pointy ears much like milia but mirages are more obvious and stick out from underneath her hair
anime,not_removed,his chest is suddenly really sculpted for a gsuit so id go for the var explanation
anime,not_removed,if you can understand delta fine then frontier should be ez
anime,not_removed,nope any thing you may miss out on is references to macross and its music but otherwise any other macross timeline stuff is usually given at the beginning of the episodes
anime,not_removed,do you remember love utheevilcubi says it might specifically mean the song though not just a reference to the movie
anime,not_removed,the other four members didnt have their hair sticking out of the helmet
anime,not_removed,oh crap youre right my bad i mixed up the terminology
anime,not_removed,ooooohhhh i kept repeating dont i feel silly thanks
anime,not_removed,depends if micronisation changes anything or not too hopefully lady m will be revealed at some point or it turns out to be mikumo being sneaky
anime,not_removed,possible but she doesnt have the amount of existing screen timerecognizability as the others this seems like a more important job than isamus own little movie cameo
anime,not_removed,do send any links to any that you find especially yuri
anime,not_removed,unfortunately it has yet to and likely wont be used in actual combat
anime,not_removed,httpmacrosswikiacomwikiinertiastoreconverter
anime,not_removed,you are using comment counts as an argument against the shows quality try at least to make an argument related to the show i can explain the low number of comments macross is not being streamed on any of the usual services its a mecha anime and its part of a franchise all these factors always result in lower viewer ship specially the fact that its mecha and if you ask me a fan of nearly all kawamoris works i was expecting far worse numbers delta is doing really well in terms of reception
anime,not_removed,episode had comments i dont see why comments are suddenly an accurate representation of a shows popularity to begin with especially for a series like macross where the fandom here in the west is already badly divided by harmony gold and its robotech nonsense
anime,not_removed,no thats like buying an ippd and putting two albums on it thats too cheap you need instead
anime,not_removed,a friend of mine has bought two ipod because of musical anime why two he filled up one to full capacity youre fine totally fine
anime,not_removed,just embrace it bru
anime,not_removed,its that or planet dance fever
anime,not_removed,the album just arrived today already downloaded high quality flacs though
anime,not_removed,her pants look like theyre supposed to be a suspenderoverall type thing on a less free spirited person
anime,not_removed,i see thank you mate
anime,not_removed,thanks i will give it a try soon
anime,not_removed,shes ika musume
anime,not_removed,oh i didnt catch that
anime,not_removed,i doubt its mikumo nobody in the crew seems to know who she is and if she is seriously i know shes mysterious but come on
anime,not_removed,is here usually use this site for any new updates the doujin isnt bad either art is pretty close in similarity great addition to any uhresearch log
anime,not_removed,high quality flacs pls where do tell
anime,not_removed,sauce sauce sauce pls pm
anime,not_removed,it was just a random shower thought though it is pretty ridiculous to think that she would be
anime,not_removed,wow that art is reallyhigh quality too bad it isnt translated also found the makina one but that doesnt appeal quite as much since its straight
anime,not_removed,pmd
anime,not_removed,done
anime,not_removed,the first episode did imply that lady m was mikumo then the later lady m name drops started to occur while mikumo was in the same room and steered things away from that interpretation
anime,not_removed,yeah no reina yet
anime,not_removed,can i get this too upvoted fam
anime,not_removed,oooh woops my stupid ass thought you meant the entire walkure attack album released early or somth yuitears
anime,not_removed,well first time i may actually be onto something its either that or someone closely linked to mikumo
anime,not_removed,i just want some nice lewds of mirage
anime,not_removed,nope still july
anime,not_removed,so is are they gonna stop making episodes for shippuden once boruto airs
anime,not_removed,calling it now warau salesman looks like its going to be a sleeper hit tag me if that ends up being true
anime,not_removed,shingeki no bahamut hype the biggest turnaround in opinion ive ever had before and after watching an episode i read the based on the trading card game description and didnt watch half a second of it for a couple of months and then i saw an unusual amount of upvotes for discussion threads and holy shit its so fun
anime,not_removed,ill be looking forward to saitamas new anime and holy shit ajin ova and its about satous past e s im just talking about that anime souryo to majiwaru because he does look like caped baldy anyway forgot to mention frame arms girl hopefully its not another anime of girls who found special giftspackages eventually fell into battlefield of suffering
anime,not_removed,i can see it some people out there will go hey this isnt rezero raawr after watching zero kara hajimeru
anime,not_removed,im very excited for sakura quest kanami sekiguchi designs some of the best looking characters ive ever seen
anime,not_removed,attack on titan season sakurada reset after its almost done airing and people have judged it since it sounds like erased but worse i ignored it until now but the fucking smug face on in busou shoujo machiavellism caused me to decide to watch it seikai suru kado since i need to rip on an apparent isekai anime that overlord movie recap because why the fuck not eromangasensei is it just me or does shuumatsus description sound like its a madlib dungeon ni deai wo motomeru no wa machigatteiru darou ka gaiden sword oratoria is the longest title i have ever seen
anime,not_removed,im so sequel filled next season with mostly action i need to get more new anime anything you think will be worth picking up aside from sakura quest the only new anime i have on my ptw aside from that picking up attack on titan danmachi spinoff rage of bahamut kekkai sensen eccentric family sakura quest total with little witch academia as a carryover which is the lightest ive been in a while interested but would need to catch up my hero academia natsume yuujinchou still considering atom the beginning clockwork planet recreators
anime,not_removed,i thought kekkai sensen getting season this spring either way too many second season of my fav animes
anime,not_removed,has there ever been a season stacked with great sequels like this hero academia attack on titan rage of bahamut saekano even if all the newly ipadaptions fall flat this certainly wont be a disappointing season
anime,not_removed,souryo to majiwaru shikiyoku no yoru ni i like how the source was listed not just as manga but specifically adult manga tiredfate
anime,not_removed,natsume
anime,not_removed,love kome we love rice what the flipping fuck japan
anime,not_removed,tsugumomo is a fun manga but i have a feeling the anime is going to turn out bad particularly because its probably going to have to be heavily editedcensored calling it the dark horse of the season if it turns out well
anime,not_removed,with all these sequels we shant ignore the potential aoty motherfucking snack world
anime,not_removed,when do we start fighting over which shows are going to be worthwhile ive never gotten to participate in that before
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,i know there is no hype around it but i am really exited for the ln is absolutely fantastic really hope it becomes a hit next season
anime,not_removed,oooo a reverse trap anime girl beats boys rengehype goes to boys only school and fights akyuusqueel
anime,not_removed,good lord the amount of sequels is so nice aot hero academia starmyu boruto berserk rinne saekano eccentric family shingeki no bahamut natsume and danmachi spinoff and theres a lot of promising new shows renai bouken absolutely love the manga sakura quest praise pa works and tsugumomo please please please dont let this be a bad adaption are shows im definitely checking out among many other new shows
anime,not_removed,after years of streaming sites getting me with attack on titan april releases i finally feel vindicated
anime,not_removed,two yuasa films in one season is amazing too bad the wait for bds will probably be months
anime,not_removed,really looking forward to saekano and eromangasensei
anime,not_removed,alright this is the season where ill reduce the amount of anime i watch and try to get more social life wait this got second season that too man this one as well oh this one looks interesting man guess ill watch this too one more wouldnt hurt right me every season
anime,not_removed,ill be looking to pa works and science saru the most this season i only now saw that yuasas second film was revealed and coming out in spring course im happy for and several of the new shows too
anime,not_removed,hinako note a sol about a girl who eats books count me in looks like a wide selection of shows to check out
anime,not_removed,theres a lot im excited for here the top are probably attack on titan atom the beginning and tsugumomo
anime,not_removed,actually went through anichart last night and picked out what im going to check out
anime,not_removed,hinako note is gonna fill up my seasonal quota for cgdgt any more and ill probably overdose
anime,not_removed,alice to zourokru sounds like a fun mix of jc staff comfy with flip flappers visuals and a relatable grouchy old man in tow tsuki ga kirei i have a soft spot for feel studios sol and with this being an original story it might mean we get a proper ending for once kabukibu could be an interesting follow up to rakugo so im keeping an eye on this one warau salesman sounds like a really dark comedy hopefully itll translate well
anime,not_removed,whelp im an hour late and too lazy but is there anything different in this version compared to the cause right now i already got shows due to all the sequels and spinoff so scanning through this list is like watching this watching this watching this ill check this out watching this etc i mean holy moly look at just the sequels alone im gonna watch aot bnh saekano danmachi sword oratia shingeki no bahamut eccentric family then theres all the other adaptationsoriginals well pack up your bags guys cause this season looks to be a lot of fun
anime,not_removed,time for predictions sakurada reset or sakura quest will be aots beserk and clockwork planet will be massive disappointments gigguk will have a field day on watch a bunch of cute girls not kiss bnha will be overhyped and be just as decent as season warau salesman will have a niche following and four s by the end of the season tsugomomo will be a fucking joke and i will love watching every minute of it people will mix up this sin nanatsu for the wildly popular alice no zoukoru will be a sleeper with an incredibly high mal score but nobody will watch it eromanga will be a fucking joke and i will love watching every minute of it and lastly ranime will throw a fucking shitfit when attack on titan discussions hold the front page every saturday
anime,not_removed,a lot of interesting premises outside sequels at least one or two should be done right alice to zouroku and atom the beginning are two im curious for
anime,not_removed,atom the beginning looks interesting i dont know much about astroboy but im a sucker for the cartoony character designs of osamu tezuka
anime,not_removed,zero kara really reminds me of an older anime called sands of destruction
anime,not_removed,love kome looks hype
anime,not_removed,a season with potentially lots of good action series finally
anime,not_removed,holy shit new anime is this the most ever from a single season
anime,not_removed,looking at the trailers some of these new titles are interesting sakurada reset just blowing my mind the music too oh yes also pa works hype for two series in a season
anime,not_removed,eccentric family will be the underrated show of the season titan and hero academia will steal the show kabukibu also has potential to the be the rakugo of kabuki it is deen after all
anime,not_removed,ooh more natsume im really picky with anime and dont like the overly colourful fantasyadventure stuff so there isnt really much here that seems interesting ill check out kabukibu because clamp and i have a vague interest in kabuki and tsuki ga kirei because it also seems to have good character designs and might turn out to be decent
anime,not_removed,it just keeps getting better the more i scroll down • my hero academia – yasss • attack on titan – yasssssssss • berserk – yaaasssssssssssss • kyoukai no rinne – yassssssssssssssssss • danmachi – yassssssssssssssssss • bahamut yassssssssssssssssssss • natsume yuujinchou – imagine that reaction but replace the yas with the frequency and intensity of my fist hitting the table that was me already more sequels than there are winter anime that im watching edit how in the almighty left fuck did i miss the ajin ova this season is a fucking gift
anime,not_removed,spring is looking jampacked with goodshit definitely cant kill myself any time soon
anime,not_removed,wheres all the moe shows guess i wont be watching many shows next seasonwell yugioh vrains is there so it shouldnt be that bad ptw yugioh vrains hinako note eromanga sensei at least theres some interesting movies like the doraemon movie and yuyuyu prequels
anime,not_removed,i think i will only be looking at a few this season danmachi tsugomomo clockwork planet and maybe a wild card series like hmm oushitsu kyoushi haine
anime,not_removed,looking forward to yugioh vrains renai boukun atom the beginning and recreators
anime,not_removed,hmmm only alice to zouroku and sakura quest catch my eye but i guess time will tell if the latter is as close to shirobako as im hoping which i also hoped for girlish number but anyway
anime,not_removed,clockwork planet dungeon eromanga sensei tsuki ga kirei and hinako note not sure what else to watch
anime,not_removed,i always get excited when this chart comes out the thrill of clicking that zoom in button and rapidly scroll to see if theres anything that looks original or not overlytropey
anime,not_removed,souryo to majiwaru shikiyoku no yoru ni i never imagined johnny sin to get his own anime he is really the most talented man in the world
anime,not_removed,granblue fantasy the animation on the one hand its a fantasy anime that isnt stuck in a video game its an adaptation of a game but thats different and on the plus side its not a light novel adaptation on the other hand its pictures im honestly really hesitant about this one the description makes it sound like a truly grounded fantasy property that isnt campy or cheesy ie mc is not an otaku loser who gets transported to some alternate game reality sort of like spice and wolf but i wouldnt be surprised if the mc turns out to be kiritobot like in a lot of shows
anime,not_removed,im kinda excited for fukumenkei noise premise sounds good and its done by brains base so im expecting it to be decent ofc looking forward to saekano flat and bnha thats a hentai right that key art looks like a hentai the source is adult manga surely this is hentai ill be watching this to see if its hentai kabukibu looks like deen trying to capitalise off the success of rakugo by making a show with a similar style it worked this caught my interest sakurada reset looks strong davidpro are great and the premise is interesting so i expect great things from this one tsuki ga kirei looks like itll fill my craving for romance eromanga will be a laugh machiavellism is done by silver link and as such i will be watching it the synopsis could be dogshit and id still watch it because silver link aot i will be watching because i want them to get a very specific scene from the manga animated i dont give a shit about the rest of it but watching peoples reactions to the change in tone will be nice twin angel break looks like a flip flappers rip off but without the great art style knb last game will be hype af cant wait for that no doga kobo this season thats a shame i was looking forward to see what theyd bring
anime,not_removed,pluuuus ultraaaaaaaaaaaaa
anime,not_removed,jojo part anime still nowhere in sight im crying
anime,not_removed,very weak season for sports anime
anime,not_removed,what the hell this season is probably the best that ive seen since spring of
anime,not_removed,sakurada reset sakura quest seikai suru kado alice to zouroku recreators frame arm girl hinako note tsuki ga kirei so yeah theres bunch of stuff that seems worth checking out too bad sequels are either to total shit or to the shows i havent seenfinished overall season looks quite fun
anime,not_removed,yeah this season looks pretty promising at the very least a lot of stuff merits a episode trial from me
anime,not_removed,the new shows that sound the most interesting to me are the the kabuki thing and atom lots of solid sequels too
anime,not_removed,dem sequels tho snk natsume uchouten kazoku bnha and some interesting looking new adaptations kabukibu sakuda reset souryo to majiwaru with a premise like that i cant not watch it warau salesman atom the beginning not bad
anime,not_removed,boku no hero sakura quest natsume uchouten and fukumenkai noise for me yaaayy might check out the kabuki club one too
anime,not_removed,alice no zouroku seems interesting and hinako note looks way too much like gochuumon thinking
anime,not_removed,anyone here know anything on eromanga im a sucker for dominant lolis
anime,not_removed,honestly there are so many sequels to shows i havent seen the first seasons of my time is always tight so its gonna take me like forever to watch what i want to everytime i finish a good two or three series the next season is here and ive got five good new ones on my plate its kinda hell lol
anime,not_removed,im really looking forward to granblue fantasy the animation actually i rerolled about times in the game trying to get a good ssr starter and i gave up because it took too long its not like rerolling in pad where each reroll takes like minutes so ill live vicariously through this anime instead lol watching it will let me experience the game i missed out on
anime,not_removed,new shingeki no bahamut the better shingeki of the two in my opinion i hope the sequel is as good as the first
anime,not_removed,i am honestly glad i couldnt spot anything interesting because after last season i have a giant fucking backlog
anime,not_removed,holy shit a show about a topnotch gamer who somehow finds his way into a virtual reality world how do they come up with these groundbreaking concepts
anime,not_removed,i wasnt too impressed with the currently airing season but spring looks more up my alley
anime,not_removed,aot season hero academia spinoff of danmachi eromangasensei and saekano here we go boys also getting a strong vibe of transformers from tomica hyper rescue
anime,not_removed,re creators sound interesting and it an original anime wich is a plus for me even though more risky
anime,not_removed,i will see for sure boku no hero academia tsugumomo boruto why kishimoto why busou shoujo machiavellism nobunaga no shinobi ise kanegasakihen saenai heroine no sodatekata dungeon ni deai wo motomeru no wa machigatteiru darou ka gaiden sword oratoria i will try gin no guardian sakura reset sakura quest clockwork planet kenka banchou otome girl beats boys zero kara hajimeru mahou no sho eromangasensei recreators rokudenashi majutsu koushi to akaashic records sin nanatsu no taizai renai boukun shuumatsu nani shitemasu ka isogashii desu ka sukutte moratte ii desu ka fukumenkei noise hinako note tsuki ga kirei if you have any recommendations tell me
anime,not_removed,natsume yuujinchou is back
anime,not_removed,this season is exciting for a pa works fan their first time doing a season and anime a season really looking forward to eccentric family and especially sakura quest
anime,not_removed,fukemenkei noise looks like the main romance for that season
anime,not_removed,hero academia is my most hyped show
anime,not_removed,such a glorious line up i wont bother listing what ill be watching because i know my watching list next season will have like at least entries on it
anime,not_removed,i pray to god that last game gets a fast sub release i cant wait to see more insanity on the court also i just read the short description about the new yugioh anime yuusaku hates standing out and at his school he doesnt
anime,not_removed,ah warning about tsugumomo if you watch it you must make sure you are alone and you must never admit to anybody you will watch it at least that is what i heard from a friend who read the manga
anime,not_removed,omg thanks for this
anime,not_removed,saekano the best girl war continue
anime,not_removed,aot on the first of april part of me worries this is a very cruel joke
anime,not_removed,bahamut season fuck yeah cours even sign me the fuck up isnt madhouse doing anything this season though
anime,not_removed,so naturally the next question is when does cygames put money into a shadowverse anime
anime,not_removed,yay my hero academia is coming out also clockwork planet is coming i can be a manga smartass again
anime,not_removed,cant wait to watch kyoukai no rinne with the other guys that watch it on reddit
anime,not_removed,ohohohoho it seems nobody here has read the source material for alice to zouroku id say its worth a try
anime,not_removed,anyone else not able to see the image
anime,not_removed,lets see harem harem probably harem reverse harem harem
anime,not_removed,wait so they made a spinoff of dungeon without just continuing it
anime,not_removed,still waiting on symphogear season
anime,not_removed,looks like the only ones ill be watching this season is roku and sword oratoria might pick up a few depending on the first episode nothing else really stands out
anime,not_removed,am i missing something or is there a distinct lack of fsn hf
anime,not_removed,so basically a season of sequels
anime,not_removed,wait pick up girls in a dungeon spinoff
anime,not_removed,must have one punch
anime,not_removed,where the hell is black clover
anime,not_removed,seidihrdasessenneinvirsindderjager
anime,not_removed,each season theres more and more anime and each season less and less of it seems like itll be any good gotten to a point where i rarely watch more than or anime a season despite there being so many airing literally the only anime from this current season i have continued to watch has been interview with monster girls i just never got pulled in by anything else anime ill probably at least check out this season danmachi sword oratoria i enjoyed the original danmachi though i dont really think it was that good of an anime ill give this one a shot with mediocre expectations frame arms girls from the preview vids ive seen it seems like a sort of angelic layergundam build fighters anime i enjoyed both of those simply because they were just fun to watch and it appeals to my inner child plus ive been a fan of the model kits for a while fukumenkei noise i like band oriented anime but they are hit or miss hopefully this ones a hit sakura quest from the same people as shirobako please dont let me down clockwork planet the world seems interesting but this has the real opportunity of turning trash really really quick like comet lucifer did i dont really expect any of them to be super good but ill give em the ep try nothing else on that list interests me
anime,not_removed,kyoto animation doesnt have anything on that list maid dragon or would it be on there anyway if it was
anime,not_removed,is it just me or does next season look more promising than this one
anime,not_removed,a lot to look forward to this season i think attack on titan my hero academia and rage of bahamut will probably have me loving this season regardless but originals like renai boukun recreators sakurada reset shuumatsu nani sakura quest zero kara clockwork planet fukumenkei noise and tsuki ga kirei look interesting too
anime,not_removed,no one mentioned clockwork planet yet i was super curious since i heard about that one a year ago cant wait to finally watch it
anime,not_removed,hyped for anything more dan machi
anime,not_removed,with all the sequels this is looking to be a busy season for me im looking forward to bnha shingeki no kyoujin saekano still watching right now atom the beginning shingeki no bahamut provided i like plan on watching it soon kekkai sensen i dont see it here did i miss it its on mal also considering clockwork planet zero kara hajimeru mahou no sho maybe the danmachi thing if i get around to watching the first season guess thats it i could end up watching something more if it looks good once it starts
anime,not_removed,wow im actually really excited a lot of these look really cool i am totally trying that anime about rice
anime,not_removed,pretty good season honestly shows im interested in although ill likely drop a few
anime,not_removed,in a season thats stacked im pleasantly surprised the anime im looking forward to the most is souryu
anime,not_removed,sakura quest comedy eh its not wrong but sakura quest should be a slice of life
anime,not_removed,anyone know if the original warau salesman is any good mal says the new one is supposed to be a sequel as opposed to what is listed here
anime,not_removed,looking forward to of saekano
anime,not_removed,there are only like that catch my attention this probablyat least for me will be a season to catch up with other animes time to finish yuru yuri
anime,not_removed,really excited for aot season now for resident evil biohazard vendetta i wonder if its gonna connect with the events of resident evil nonetheless rebecca chambers is in it so thats awesome
anime,not_removed,sometimesthose high detailed amazing artwork anime cover just dont live up the actual anime itself when its airing
anime,not_removed,hype for room mate
anime,not_removed,how does the second season of boku no hero academia compare to season from the manga and such i didnt mind season but it didnt particularly enthuse me for a second i could see myself watching it from but is it worth the time
anime,not_removed,looking poor aside from the big
anime,not_removed,holy fuck there are so many good shit for the spring its great to know that mangas i know are gettinf anime but its lowkey stressful because idk how the anime will turn out to be hopefully a terrformer or kimi no iru machi kinda incident doesnt happen again
anime,not_removed,ima try to make a breakdown for each show soon before they start airinf and potential stuff to watch out for
anime,not_removed,extremely meh season for me might watch snk season since i waited years for this shit
anime,not_removed,in normal circumstances i would be screaming my head off with anything berserk related but not this one notthisone weeps silently
anime,not_removed,jojos bizarre adventure part vento aureo when
anime,not_removed,i havent watched any of the anime getting sequels this season i should probably do something about that other than sakura quest i have no idea what im even going to be interested in this spring
anime,not_removed,you are looking at them
anime,not_removed,aw yeah this just means i get to add more anime to my backlog
anime,not_removed,the only show im looking forward to is eromangasensei
anime,not_removed,oh hey clockwork planet is getting an anime cool one of the few things ive read recently so im looking forward to it
anime,not_removed,oh shit eromanga sensei airs this season if oreimo is any guide im looking forward to all that salt that potentially brings out of the community
anime,not_removed,i love that tsugumomo is airing on my birthday definitely a welcomed birthday present
anime,not_removed,really looking forward to sukasuka shuumatsu nani shitemasu ka ive only heard good things about the light novel
anime,not_removed,has more episodes to come stupid mushroom girls
anime,not_removed,im actually kinda glad im looking at this chart and going ehh to a lot of it because ill finally have a chance to get through some of my backlog haha like thats ever gonna happen
anime,not_removed,wow i am interested in literally none of these series i think thats a first guess its backlog season
anime,not_removed,attack on titan will be pushed back again and naruto needs to die
anime,not_removed,dude in souryo to maji looks like saitama
anime,not_removed,gin no guardian is the only new series that has caught my eye
anime,not_removed,shittiest image host na
anime,not_removed,no new show from madhouse me sad
anime,not_removed,i dont see enough hype for boku no hero academia deku deku deku
anime,not_removed,too hyped for boku no hero
anime,not_removed,are still going to continue using the cgi for berserk to be honest i hope not either way i will still watch it
anime,not_removed,when is steinsgate coming happy about attack on titan returning though
anime,not_removed,looks like its gonna be a pretty good season lots of good seasons and quite a few new ones that look interesting enough to give a try
anime,not_removed,clockwork planet ryuzu best girl
anime,not_removed,fuck yes season of danmachi
anime,not_removed,now that full metal panic and spice and wolf are happening what are people going to put on the joke charts
anime,not_removed,i found another reason we cant be on the front page on a lustful night mingling with a priest i love seeing what the source material is for all of these shows this particular one is an adult manga
anime,not_removed,where is db super
anime,not_removed,finally been waiting for this thanks op
anime,not_removed,what show from this season do you think will be good for a guy that likes cute girls slice of life
anime,not_removed,bahamut and uchouten kazoku
anime,not_removed,i honestly dont understand how millipensegemba got the rights for a second season of berserk with how bad their animation quality was in berserk
anime,not_removed,there are at least shows there that i will be giving a shot
anime,not_removed,exited for uchoten kazoku and natsume
anime,not_removed,soo can someone tell me is that danmachi or a danmachi spin off
anime,not_removed,such a stacks season cannot wait
anime,not_removed,on saturday we have my hero academia attack on titan on wednesday we have boruto on thursday we have clockwork planet saenai heroine no sodateka on friday we have danmachi spin off and these are just the shows i know will be good not even counting things im going into blind this season is looking to be season of the year
anime,not_removed,is berserk still going to be cgi orrrr
anime,not_removed,well thats a hefty list and it looks like there could be some good stuff there i dont watch ongoing shows but ill probably be queuing up a good many of these
anime,not_removed,overlord movie please come faster i need you
anime,not_removed,to watch religiously attack on titan my hero academia will watch eventually boruto natsume rip kekkai sensen
anime,not_removed,actually sorta hyped for the fairy tail movie
anime,not_removed,man i thought i was paying attention to upcoming anime but there are several on here i didnt realize were coming out the spin off of is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon especially though i wish it was season instead of a spin off
anime,not_removed,on my definite watch list are nobunaga no shinobi clockwork planet my hero academia these ones look interesting sakurada reset eromangasensei uchouten kazoku
anime,not_removed,sukasuka shuumatsu nani shitemasu ka isogashii desu ka sukutte moratte ii desu ka what do you do at the end of the world are you busy will you save us looks really interesting both the synopsis and the picture that got my attention also will be checking frame arms girl even though i have no idea what it will be like looks cute not too sure about gin no guardian but i might pick it up otherwise my plans didnt change much since the last version will still definitely pick hinako note and eromangasensei
anime,not_removed,tsugumomo hype
anime,not_removed,finally a good season
anime,not_removed,oh theres a coming out on may hope thats going to be good
anime,not_removed,this might be the most packed season ive been a part of so far every other show looks interesting to me
anime,not_removed,hey thunderbolt got a release date nice and the new conan movie which ill probably watch because i dont deserve happiness
anime,not_removed,berserk season oh my god
anime,not_removed,winter was the first season that i watched while airing and i really loved it with like shows im currently watching just looking at this list i dont really see too many shows that look like must watch to me only sakura quest sakurada reset and fukumenkei noise really look promising with some other that look intriguing but i dont know what to think of yet i hope spring will be a good season i might have been a little spoiled by starting in winter season
anime,not_removed,some interesting titles there i havent seen a lot with second seasons yet but will definitely be checking out attack on titan season sakurada reset looks like it could be interesting so i might give that a watch as someone who watched the original yugioh series when i was younger im actually really surprised to see that there were five shows before the current one will probably pass on it though i think ill just stick with those two unless something gets good reviews in which case ill check it out
anime,not_removed,maximum hype atom eromangasensei sakura quest shingeki no bahamut grimoire of zero medium hype as in please be good tsugumomo clockwork planet machiavellianism yes thats the title not machiavellism himeko note renai boukun shuumatsu nani rokudenashi majutsu kyoushi sagrada reset i guess ill watch it frame arms girls come on its mechagical girls alice to zouroku fukumenkei noise granblue fantasy kabukibu recreators kekkai sensen sin nanatsu no taizai love saitama twin angel break gotta finish already uchoten kazoku hyped as fuck for a first good looking fantasy show thats not isekai bullshit in a while
anime,not_removed,not a good season from a first look anime i will watch for sure saekano of course eromanga sensei source is not bad can be a good anime renai boukun source is hilarious will be a good anime and nothing else i will give a try to tsugumomo so so battle harem we will see sakura quest seems a good sliceoflifeworking life i like that locodol feelings from it and i liked locodol very much danmachi sword oratoria danmachi is not a bad anime only not so good souryo to majiwaru an adaptation of an adult manga really i will watch it only to see what it will be hinako note premise intrigues me rural girl going to big city are always enjoyable and with a bookeating girl fukumenki noise keionbu always welcome everything else i will see to knows how much good it is theres a bunch of ova that i like hibike haifuri yeah umaruchan one room but its really weak as a season for me so time to watch my backlog i think
anime,not_removed,woah berserk tell me its not that awful cgianimation combo thing again
anime,not_removed,which one of these have ecchi lolis
anime,not_removed,boruto is starting really looking forward to that one
anime,not_removed,sees yugioh vrains triggered so much rn but at least we have change in yugioh now
anime,not_removed,gintama is also continuing right
anime,not_removed,my list is still guaranteed watch attack on titan saenai heroine no sodatekata will give it a couple of episodes clockwork planet idolmster spinoff nobunaga no shinobi dungeon ni deai framearms girls recreators
anime,not_removed,this makes two seasons in a row that nothing has stood out to me am i becoming to jaded or is anime getting less interesting
anime,not_removed,jojo part
anime,not_removed,this season is so packed full i feel like im going to have to sacrifice some of the new shows im interested in just so i can watch the sequel seasons
anime,not_removed,looking good but wtf is that nanatsu no taizai one
anime,not_removed,i dont want to be that guy but i dont see many shows im truly looking forward to in spring apart from some sequels it seems to be a lot of battle series in a fantasyscifi setting which i do not much care for i have shows i plan to watch and the ones i can say im looking forward to are uchouten kazoku bnha kabukiru sakura quest sakuarada reset tsuki ga kirei the new yuasa movie
anime,not_removed,uchouten kazoku and bahamut sequels i cant fucking wait also some interesting new series
anime,not_removed,snk and boku no hero academia yay
anime,not_removed,yes more rage of the bahamut
anime,not_removed,and here i am waiting for season two of overlord
anime,not_removed,aww hells yes gimme some more dungeon loved the original series
anime,not_removed,just rewatched saenei heroine recently so am hype as fuck for second season ive heard rumors the new berserk anime wont be as cringy as the last with the shit so i got a small hope for that shingeki no bahamut definitely watching this hero academia def watching this too aside from these theres like to shows that ill try out and see if are any good
anime,not_removed,holy shit one of my favorite web comics is getting an anime soooo hyped its pretty generic but i think its awesome d
anime,not_removed,im seeing some promises here
anime,not_removed,alot of stuff there that looks good too lazy to list it all though
anime,not_removed,this honestly looks like one of the weakest seasons in recent memory to me the only shows i know ill be picking up so far are recreators atom the beginning hinako note maybe sakura quest warau salesman new shingeki no bahamut if its more like the first half of tsugumomo if they manage to make a proper adaption alice to zouroku later uchouten kazoku after i finally get to natsume after i catch up berserk probably after the brd release
anime,not_removed,its the best thing when you see a manga youve been following for a while just suddenly getting an anime
anime,not_removed,better image
anime,not_removed,what is yugioh vrains card games on surf boards
anime,not_removed,my hero academia hyyyyyype

anime,not_removed,boku no hero academia season two and attack on titan season two no joke spring is lit
anime,not_removed,so many stuff ive been looking forward to will be airing cant wait
anime,not_removed,holy shit that is one stacked season
anime,not_removed,am i the only one who is really looking forward to warau salesman since only a couple ones are translated from the original one
anime,not_removed,ah seasonal anime so nostalgic i remember hungrily looking over my first list which i found on tv tropes forums during the spring season i swear i was watching at least five anime that season such a simpler time anyway on to this list considering that one of the anime i watched that season was attack on titan im excited to finally be getting the sequel season sakura reset looks interesting it seems like charlotte maybe even hamatora assuming the ecchi one punch man lookalike show is a short ill watch it i liked okusama ga seitokaichou from last year well enough and then theres the fight for the last spot shuumatsu nani looks kind of interesting key word kind of i dont know but i could like it if the romance is good im not sure if alice no zorouko or frame arms girls looks better probably the former which reminds me of gokukoku no bryhnhildr the latter however would probably prove to be my most interesting mecha however the premise reminds me of custom robo my decision making process would probably be helped if i actually watched the pvs it occurred to me that im wasting my time writing this since doubtless no one will read this comment
anime,not_removed,wow its been a while since ive had more than shows i was interested in and now i have eight this season will be great
anime,not_removed,i thought one punch mans second season was scheduled for this spring was i wrong about that
anime,not_removed,well other than little witch im only watching sequels
anime,not_removed,probably about time to start making a ptw list sequels spinoffs im interested in boku no hero academia attack on titan berserk danmachi sword oratoria atom the beginning new shows that look good sakura quest tsuki ga kirei new shows that have potential but i need more information to make a proper decision tsugumomo warau salesman sakurada reset clockwork planet kabukibu kenka banchou otome puripuri chiichan alice to zouroku renai boukun frame arms girl hinako note oushitsu kyoushi haine shows that are probably going to be terrible but ill watch anyway because im trash eromanga sensei sin nanatsu no taizai
anime,not_removed,prediction ranime will be disappointed by clockwork planet and renai boukun will be at least somewhat dark horseish atom beginnings will be critically appreciated and popularly ignored
anime,not_removed,glad to see some decent stuff after the disappointment that was winter season
anime,not_removed,damn spring is gonna be loaded havent wanted to follow this many shows in awhile
anime,not_removed,so uh why isnt heavens feel listed as an upcoming movie
anime,not_removed,nobody hype for quan zhi gao shouesport anime im a huge fan of the novels
anime,not_removed,when does berserk come out
anime,not_removed,well im only watching things titan bahamut yo its two cours this time and gundam thunderbolt one thing though this tomica drive head whatever it is how is that not transformers
anime,not_removed,yoake tsugeru lu no uta looks amazing holy shit
anime,not_removed,original anime are weak this season but so many nice sequels wow
anime,not_removed,hell yea cant wait altho im a bit surprised they will still milk narutolike that
anime,not_removed,i like this site for looking at what anime stuff is going on
anime,not_removed,wait no doga kobo anime next season how am i supposed to survive berserk cour without their sol sanity treatments
anime,not_removed,sequels aot rage of bahumut bnha strong bets sakura quest zero kara hajimeru mahou no sho alice to zouroku kabukibu iffy sakurada reset clockwork planet seikaisuru kado fukumenkei noise hinako note akashic records of bastard magic instructor recreators possibly worth watching for sawano ost alone
anime,not_removed,waifu wars is coming guys saenai heroine no sodatekata
anime,not_removed,im super excited for this season since i dont have many shows im watching this season basically only konosuba gabriel and masamune next season is going to be really fun for me considering i enjoyed reading the light novelmanga versions of it roku de nashi shuumatsu saenai oratorio the book of zero renai boukun
anime,not_removed,ctrlf uchouten kazokueccentric family results total i suppose its to be expected given that its a sequel but even the first one didnt garner all that much attention despite being aoty seriously watch uchouten kazoku you will not be disappointed anyway as everyone else has already mentioned its a very sequel heavy season for big names shingeki no kyojin boku no hero academia clank berserk uchouten kazoku saekano danmachi spinoffsequelwhatever it is shingeki no bahamut yugioh virtual surfboard card battles natsume fucking yuujinchou or i cant remember and a plethora of sequels for things that dont appeal to me starmyu more aikatsu a few tcgmobage boruto rinne no kyoukai typing that out it feels like almost all of spring is going to be sequels but luckily there are quite a few promising standalone series both original and adapted works here are a few im excited for or interested in tsugumomo who knows how this will go probably badly considering the appeal of the manga is the overthetop ecchi comedy and absurdly detailed fight scenes and designs which will be very difficult to properly portray in animated form whatever happens ill be along for the ride regardless warau salesman new dont know much about this series other than its a reboot of a very old mangaanime character design looks neat and i could use a decent episodic series sakurada reset special powers and romance reminds me of iris zero time travel is just icing on the cake could be great could be fucking awful david production is a promising name to do this series sakura quest an obvious contender for rsliceoflifeanimes aots after the wild success of shirobako im hopeful but it can be hard to find the right balance of workplace drama and nothing happening that shirobako got so right fantastic character designs kabukibu i was initially apprehensive due to the maleheavy advertising but after being blown away by acca this season i decided to throw away my prejudice very intriguing artstyle and clamp character designs are always great im personally interested in kabuki theatre as well so hopefully this is a good way to learn a bit about it atom the beginning a prequel to astro boy oh man could be a lot of fun and the tezuka inspired characters look really good hopefully the cg isnt too distracting and they find a good balance of kidfriendly but dark story undertones to keep things interesting zero kara hajimeru mahou no sho or i cant believe its not rezero the manga is quite fun and despite what you might think it isnt another isekai series but actual fantasy i dont know too much about the story as ive only read chapters of the manga so it could get worse but as an adventure series it looks quite fun renai boukun the manga is an absolute riot and if they can nail the comedy it might be comedy of the season alice to zouroku a fatherfiguredaughter pairing that doesnt have the potential to go full usagi drop could be the feels anime of the season if done well and as usual there are a large number of bogstandard or initially unimpressive series that might require a few episodes to get a grasp on busou shoujo machiavellism i know nothing about this series but the completely ridiculous title equally ridiculous looking characters and an even more ridiculous premise has me interested could be fun or a total disaster clockwork planet i would love to be excited about this but knowing xebec is at the helm is a very scary thing the directors only major works are nyarukosan which is a very very different kind of series waiting with bated breath eromangasensei from the creator of oreimo comes another shitty series about an imouto who is a brocon as creatively bankrupt as the premise is im sure its characters will get tons of fanart and dominate pixiv recreators im not sure what to say about this other than it looks like a complete and utter clusterfuck and could be the trainwreck series of the season something something akashic records this is actually a pretty fun series despite being a very generic battle academyharem premise mc is a battle with brains type and the story doesnt totally suck ass sin nanatsu no taizai after everyone figures out that this is very obviously not that nanatsu no taizai the only people left watching this will probably only be in it for a weekly fap though you cant expect much from a series based on a line of scale figures frame arms girl i really enjoyed busou shinki and this could be a decent replacement if the isnt fucking awful which it probably will be holy shit this name is long it may as well be a fucking plot synopsis desu ka will probably be a complete disaster but the setting has potential and the plot could be decent if it pulls off its premise well fukumenkei noise its a shoujostyled lovetriangle which should be an immediate turnoff but its also a music maybe even rock series so thats a draw for me main girl is pretty cute tsuki ga kirei your pure solromance series of the season produced by feel whose work on oregairu was excellent and as usual there are a ton of fujoshifemale aimed series that i generally dont bother even trying a single episode of anymore overall it feels like a season that has a lot of new potential that could easily be squandered with a very strong sequel lineup for people to stick with regardless of how everything else turns out
anime,not_removed,next season is bad except for sakura quest don don donuts
anime,not_removed,kind of lowkey season it seems like a few interesting sequels and some titles with potential but nothing with the hype winter brought us oh well at least lwa is continuing
anime,not_removed,the aot date is an actual joke
anime,not_removed,this chart is no point only for pirates there is no legit streaming service that has all anime
anime,not_removed,it should be ending soon i think
anime,not_removed,yes since there are no further plans for shippuuden after the lns are adapted besides chapter only episodes are left for the last ln so the anime should end after episodes in total in march
anime,not_removed,maybe they are planning to directly roll over to boruto keep the brand going strong
anime,not_removed,is it an adaptation of the chapter mini manga thing
anime,not_removed,wow they still making episodes i think a saw the final fight months back the fuck are they showing every week
anime,not_removed,does anyone know any episodes worth watching after the naruto and sasuke fight have not been keeping up after the main story concluded
anime,not_removed,what you sad about it
anime,not_removed,shippuden will most likely end after the hour special of naruto and hinattas wedding
anime,not_removed,its episodic so it wont draw that much attention
anime,not_removed,the only thing on this list that catches my interest really
anime,not_removed,tis the year of salesmen
anime,not_removed,i wasnt really a fan of the old laughing salesman anime but it was very dated who knows
anime,not_removed,it is the pirates of the caribbean of anime
anime,not_removed,the shingeki no bahamut game is kind of dead outside of japan but cygames the company who made it has a newer card game shadowverse which is getting really popular right now the lastest expansion in shadowverse at this moment is rise of bahamut and has a bunch of iconic cards from that game you should give it a try if you like games like hearthstone but with more anime waifus
anime,not_removed,youve gotta understand that unlike ygo its not based on a tcg but on a tcgs lore incidentally an anime about ygos lore in particular about duel terminal is the one things the want the most
anime,not_removed,i had no idea we were finally getting this i know they have teased it for ages but its coming next season i am so ready i cant wait to see how the gang is doing years later after that finale of combo
anime,not_removed,saitamas new anime ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
anime,not_removed,when i saw that face i though is is that saitama and then i read the description guess im gonna watch what happens when opm goes to bone town
anime,not_removed,saitama is a chestman who knew
anime,not_removed,and holy shit ajin ova and its about satous past this one surprised me and i couldnt be happier
anime,not_removed,god damnit i had to doubletake then i realized what you were talking about and was disappointed it s was just a bald man who kinda looks like him not even the same animeverse or genre
anime,not_removed,aaand livechart lists it as a short kurisudisappointed
anime,not_removed,i legitimately thought that this was going to be a rezero sequel when it was first announced the names are so similar and for added weirdness its being animated by white fox as well nonetheless this looks like an interesting fantasy story that im still going to check out
anime,not_removed,you overestimate peoples ability to tell it isnt rezero more like hey wheres subaru wheres rem who are all these characters is that emilia she looks different is this a prequel or sequel
anime,not_removed,and then theyll go raawr for different reasons
anime,not_removed,zero kara hajimeru when i googled the name to find the mal page rezero came up first it will definitely be confusing
anime,not_removed,i cant help but feel like this was intentional
anime,not_removed,it kinda lookssounds like it might be related to zero no tsukaima except the characters are all wrong and it seems to be by a different company
anime,not_removed,i guess but reading the description i have an entirely different reaction in that it reminds me too much of sort of a shifted around kurohime character named zero about a witch with a mercenary guard except reverse the genders
anime,not_removed,zero kara hajimeru and recreators which is the true rezero sequel
anime,not_removed,i was thinking zero no tsukaima myself also wrong haha
anime,not_removed,called zero kara hajimeru produced by the same studio i mean come on
anime,not_removed,thats my most anticipated title for spring but im trying to keep my expectations under control ill be happy if its half as good as shirobako
anime,not_removed,hanasaku iroha still has some of my favorite character designs in recent memory
anime,not_removed,she designed like characters in shirobako and not one of them is like the others and every character is so eyecandy
anime,not_removed,im moderately excited for it the premise seems interesting and pa works rocks the working women genre im kinda hoping for a spiritual successor to shirobako
anime,not_removed,i ignored it until now but the fucking smug face on the guy in busou shoujo machiavellism caused me to decide to watch it hes even more smug in the manga it should be a fun series since the mc is a more smug version of the trinity seven one
anime,not_removed,one hentai grope man ftfy
anime,not_removed,i dont think the danmachi spinoff is even the
anime,not_removed,sakurada reset after its almost done airing and people have judged it since it sounds like erased but worse i guess cos of the time rewinds it would be compared to erased and to an extent rezero when he actively commits suicide to go back to a save point and fix things i might like the premise more if the day rewind wasnt by choice but a random event never stresstrauma based looking forward to going to the cinema on saturday wake up go there and wait and wait and wait for your date to find out you are meant to be at school
anime,not_removed,has an interesting premise imo its being done by david production and the director has directed both non non biyori kokoro connect and tanakakun as shows of note
anime,not_removed,interested but would need to catch up my hero academia do it you wont regret it it was amazing
anime,not_removed,try to catch up on saekano its a fun show with one of the best girl war ever
anime,not_removed,its not technically danmachi iirc someone here tell me if im wrong
anime,not_removed,anything you think will be worth picking up motherfucking snack world
anime,not_removed,youve got a great set of pickups by the looks of it including the ones you need to catch up on the shows id consider maybe give an episode or and will be trying myself are the following alice to zouroku potential busou shouujo machiavellianism i dont expect this one to be any good but it has the word machiavellianism in it so im down to try it eromanga sensei i mean we both know what to expect here fukumenkei noise brains base music romance definitely worth a shot for me at least granblue fantasy shows are at the very least well produced so well see what happens here kabukibu deen has a very interesting art style that intrigues me a lot sakurada reset time travel david production anything that attempts time travel gets an automatic try from me shuumatsu nani shitemasu not much to say here it says romance so im gonna give it a shot souryu to majiwaru saitama romance probably ecchi definitely giving this a shot tsuki ga kirei romance and by studio feel will definitely be giving it a shot zero kara hajimeruu looks like shimakaze got her own spin off show at any rate i think it will be popular so ill be giving it a shot anyway these are the other shows you dont have listed that ill be keeping my eye on and most likely trying out hope the season has a good turn out looks promising thusfar
anime,not_removed,little witch is a split cour it wont be carrying over
anime,not_removed,if this season is loaded with comedies next season definitely seems actionpacked im pretty happy for action fans at least tsugumomo might be decent if they can do any of the action any justice from the manga though its one of the raunchiest ecchi anime in recent memory so its comedy style might not be for everyone
anime,not_removed,still considering recreators as soon as i saw that hiroyuki sawano was doing the soundtrack the doubt vanished
anime,not_removed,kekkai sensen i dont see this one listed
anime,not_removed,if clockwork planet is like the manga ie not focusing on ecchi to the detriment of the plot it should do well it does a bit of everything and does it well action sequence plot discussions lighthearted jokes and sad bits and its quicked paste well see
anime,not_removed,ive written a bit about it on the blog but i believe the info on mal is incorrect at least for now only the year was stated for this series the month was never specified httpkekkaisensencom if im wrong feel free to point it out and itll be fixed for the or it might be announced for spring this month and the problem will be solved too edit for the record every item in the chart is crosschecked between its official website moonphase mal and ann with ann taking precedence over mal in most cases this doesnt make things perfect but it helps
anime,not_removed,either way too many second season of my fav animes how is this is an issue
anime,not_removed,i honestly never expected to get a second season of saekano seeing it on that list has been the highlight of today
anime,not_removed,im just happy theyre finally being honest with themselves it was never about the fish or the soy sauce baby
anime,not_removed,checked out the website was pleased with the pun
anime,not_removed,gohan wa okazu
anime,not_removed,same im excited for it cos its an amazing manga but im also cautious about it the way i look at it it has roughly a chance for everything to go to hell
anime,not_removed,have you seen the pv its screaming poor adaptation put together a heavy material source and noname anime studio and you can see how this going turn out to be
anime,not_removed,from the looks of the pv i feel like the nudity will be something like its not as annoying and still provides the fanservice given from the series given that the creator loves his spreadout legs it fits perfectly
anime,not_removed,gintamathispleasesme
anime,not_removed,usually thats the first week of the season when people weigh their first reactions and precious time and then start placing their bets as which shows are shit and which arent
anime,not_removed,it has already begun haha this is the rush where people whove read the source material do their best to hype up the adaptations for the rest of us and we try to extrapolate quality based on the previous works of cast and crew leading to the inevitable it was totally overhyped comments
anime,not_removed,which one are you most excited for
anime,not_removed,or it will have mecha like all other xebec shows uchuu senkan heroic age break blade
anime,not_removed,from the synopsis it sounds great but what everyone is saying isnt exactly filling me with confidence
anime,not_removed,its from the no game no life guy so probably
anime,not_removed,im planning on it being ass myself
anime,not_removed,the author of ngnl is partly involved with this novel so we might get some ecchi
anime,not_removed,ive heard that the ln is a lot better than the synopsis suggests so im pretty excited to see what happens with it not getting my hopes up too much though just in case its a crap adaptation
anime,not_removed,im a bit scared for it the source is absolutely amazing but being doing by satelight makes me a bit uneasy just hoping this means theyll give it cours and adapt the whole thing even if it wont look that great
anime,not_removed,intersting mal says this part of the novel is already finished within volumes so we might get a complete adaptation of this
anime,not_removed,finally someone who has high expectation for shuumatsu i personally havent read this but ive heard so many good things form ln readers and i really hope that it will take ranime by surprise
anime,not_removed,im hopeful for this too the synopsis makes it look like generic ln trash but all the comments ive seen from those whove read the source material say its very good
anime,not_removed,was just about to write almost the exact same comment until i saw yours i like your taste
anime,not_removed,ive got shows on my list for this season so far i seriously doubt ill stick with every single one but i said that this season and im watching still so fuck lol
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,the adaptation iirc of httpcomiccunejps published work if they continue the trend like with pan de peace and nyanko days it will be a minperep show unfortunately hopefully they can keep the quality well like nyanko i wish these adaptation would inspire scanlators to translate more of comic cunes manga
anime,not_removed,tsuki ga kirei i have a soft spot for feel studios sol and with this being an original story it might mean we get a proper ending for once really wish kei oikawa was one directing it he needs an anime original show
anime,not_removed,i did a quick count and the has more animes added to the list vs excluding the bdovas and movies
anime,not_removed,just a note sword oratoria is not a sequel but rather different events taking place in the same timeline as danmachi much better though
anime,not_removed,people will mix up this sin nanatsu for the wildly popular i was really confused when i read the name at first wondering why i hadnt seen any news of a second season before and was really disappointed to see its just some other show with practically the same name
anime,not_removed,i dont know how much more disappointed i can be with berserk after last season but the anime industry is known for their amazing ability to let me down
anime,not_removed,seems about right remind me months
anime,not_removed,whats aots
anime,not_removed,iirc itswritten creatively originated with the mangaka who did tetsuwan birdy the creative staff involved makes me think its going to be a better than people suspect
anime,not_removed,im a fan of tezuka manga so its always nice to see some of his stuff or a spinoff of it animated if you can take something classic and adapt it to be something more modern without changing the original identity then thats great i loved seeing young black jack adapted so this will probably be great too
anime,not_removed,man i really loved that anime when i was little i loved the main characters so much i remember it as world destruction though
anime,not_removed,relevant username
anime,not_removed,nope there have been in previous seasons including shorts because this list includes them as well there were in spring and in fall
anime,not_removed,the music in the sakurada reset pv was amazing im hyped for it
anime,not_removed,we were so spoiled this season
anime,not_removed,lwa hows that not moe
anime,not_removed,so hyped for vreins mc being a calm minded edgy hacker who is good at reading people sounds so promising compared to arcv and zexal i hope writters learned a thing or two from their the dark side dimension success and their arc v fail just waiting for the if you lose the duel in vr you lose your soulin real life i want my card game with edge not with egao bullcrap
anime,not_removed,its one of the most bizarrely well made ecchiaction series ive ever read the action in the series is far too competent for what it is and the ecchi elements are top notch with it just going ham on the lewdness unfortunately i dont think the anime will reach where the portion of the story where the story really starts jumping up in quality the episodic arcs involving a new exorcism and doing world building should still be fun though however the studio and staff behind it makes me concerned for the quality of the anime well get
anime,not_removed,i understand why many ppl arent all that hyped up for of attack on titan i personally didnt think all that much of but after reading the manga i wholeheartdly think alot of ppl will change their minds due to the series completely switching gears and quickly developing it into what has honestly become one of my favorite manga of all time it may not be everyones cup of tea but i think its shift in story telling will grab a lot of the ppl that complained about the lack of plot development in
anime,not_removed,i didnt even know it was about dominant lolis
anime,not_removed,the best part is will be episodes and based on the story synopsis they try to create a more engaging story this time
anime,not_removed,attack on titan
anime,not_removed,im quite optimistic about boruto actually just seeing some slice of life naruto is always something i like
anime,not_removed,apparently the ln author is the same one that wrote ngnl so hype
anime,not_removed,search for anime winter or the seasonyear you want to see most of the time users in the sub posts his own summaries or from popular youtubers just wait for the end of the current season and the start of the spring
anime,not_removed,well they teased some of the meatier story bits at the end of but havent shown any of it in the previews so far but it should start to get into some really great plot lines this season
anime,not_removed,berserk im hoping the animation will be up to par with the third movie but i have a sinking feeling it wont be
anime,not_removed,jojo wen vento
anime,not_removed,wait whats that about spice and wolf
anime,not_removed,hinako note
anime,not_removed,spin off its the same story as but from aizs pov
anime,not_removed,sword oratorias got a wildly different tone than danmachi proper theres lot of stuff on it best way to describe it is that so is shounen then danmachi is shoujo
anime,not_removed,its a direct sequel to that so its a safe bet im afraid
anime,not_removed,no this arc is only episodes it will probably continue in one or two seasons time
anime,not_removed,no its working
anime,not_removed,͡o ͜ʖ ͡o
anime,not_removed,probably
anime,not_removed,hype what is the hype anime of winter season and are you implying that series has more hype than snk season and boku no hero acadmaia season if it is personally opinion then that is fine but hype isnt the right word lwa my god anime fans standard has drop a lot what a overrated series everyone seems to be praising it but it is pretty average anime standard surely has drop if that is considered the best thing of winter season it seems the people that are complaining about the spring season are the slice of life nothing happens fans we action fans are tired of the slice of life moe anime they dominated fall and winter season it is our time to shine now
anime,not_removed,are you trolling or just fucking stupid
anime,not_removed,ive been hearing that for months now
anime,not_removed,wait wait wait naruto has lightnovels
anime,not_removed,are all lns done i know we got itachis sasukes shikamarus and now the wedding but didnt we have more than that i was sure we had a sakura and a gaara ln
anime,not_removed,i think thats the plan
anime,not_removed,the boruto anime is original content so no
anime,not_removed,theyre not bad i think it helps that the stuff afterwards is actually canon supposedly the novels those episodes are based on are canon
anime,not_removed,you could describe it as nonsexual fanservice where the characters from the original rookie teams are more prominent
anime,not_removed,they are decently animated chill short stories centered on characters that are not naruto not important but might be worth your time its really up to you
anime,not_removed,cowboy bebop was episodic
anime,not_removed,based on the disney theme park ride
anime,not_removed,like hearthstone and about times better balanced there is so many viable decks and they are all very diverse and also cygames is generous as fuck with freebies and gold is pretty fast to get
anime,not_removed,͡o ͜ʖ ͡o
anime,not_removed,one thrust man
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,itll be a lewd short s girl and saitama meeting in a class reunion ignited passion between the two ohohoh i may be guessing too much but itll be hot as this coming summer here
anime,not_removed,i actually thought it was about satellas story oh well ill take what i can get
anime,not_removed,rezero kara hajimeru isekai seikatsu zero kara hajimeru you cant really blame people for mistaking the two what coincidence both are produced by the same studio as well
anime,not_removed,recreators tho thats gonna be the one
anime,not_removed,such as eromanga sensei not being about a teacher that draws hentai manga
anime,not_removed,if its going to be like shirobako im in
anime,not_removed,smug anime guys are gonna replace smug anime girls mark my words
anime,not_removed,can one be even more smug
anime,not_removed,im hyped to see it
anime,not_removed,has directed tanakakun thats how you get my interest
anime,not_removed,oh i didnt realize the same director did those i felt a lot more lukewarm about kokoro connect and nnb than tanakakun but i guess the manga adaptation has something to do with that
anime,not_removed,its being done by david production well it just got an automatic try it
anime,not_removed,im a little interested though skeptical because of the time time travelbased stories just get abstract and unsatisfying by the end
anime,not_removed,rewatch starting on saturday ill use it to catch up
anime,not_removed,its not spin off story of a side character i just find it easier to call it since it will be a whole core but you are correct that to my knowledge its not a sequel
anime,not_removed,also wondering details says spinoff with aiz as main character
anime,not_removed,is this the new bananya
anime,not_removed,shuumatsu ln is a bit formulaic but its an entertaining story with s no harem and a dedicated pairing
anime,not_removed,i wouldnt recommend souryo min shorts so it has a high chance of being a mediocre ecchi fest
anime,not_removed,no no please dont let this be true
anime,not_removed,yes it will netflix is the one doing split cour when it comes to releasing it like they did with the seven deadly sins edit the bd listing suggest they will run after each other or with a small break
anime,not_removed,nerrgate commented higher in the thread that they dont believe kekkai sensen will be airing this spring as there isnt any indication on official mediasite it only confirms while has it listed for next season
anime,not_removed,was excited for it but we have other good shows
anime,not_removed,my bad was drunk when i wrote it
anime,not_removed,yeah theres several new adaptations and a few original shows they have a good chance of surprising us
anime,not_removed,was a clown fiesta when they announced it two years ago people were mad because it was announced for long ass time to wait
anime,not_removed,yeah ill be cheering for its success but its going to be tough to make such a difficult adaptation in both adapting the godlike manga art to skirting the censors of violence and sexual content its a very steep hill to climb
anime,not_removed,true but ive never heard of the studio doing youjo senki either and theyre doing a good job imo though the material is different im going to wait and see and give it a chance
anime,not_removed,the no nipple thing is like that because of the game they were playing it was censored in ln too
anime,not_removed,we jimmy neutron boys
anime,not_removed,goat cgi anime
anime,not_removed,what kind of a sucker do you think i am im going to wait until there are established camps and join the one that looks biggest
anime,not_removed,im up for lewd mecha
anime,not_removed,itll definitely have androids and we get to see ryuzu and marie animated d
anime,not_removed,itll have mechanisms
anime,not_removed,i know synopsis make it sound like some kind of dumb wish fullment but tone of the series is much more somber and meloncolic its like march comes in like a lion mixed with demichan someone with anxiety and depression finding hope and purpose by helping out bunch of little kids who also dont fit in
anime,not_removed,yeah staff list looks really meh but writer himself is the series composer and tatsuya kato doing the music so at least soundtrack should be pretty good
anime,not_removed,yeah the series is finished but only volume has been translated so far so i cant say for sure on weather its completed and sequel have nothing to do with it
anime,not_removed,its a really good read and translator is doing a pretty good job with it
anime,not_removed,its totally not what the synopsis makes it sound like its a pretty somber show that deals with the internal drama of its characters
anime,not_removed,also more air dates
anime,not_removed,for the actual theres a miniseries on netflix that continues where the anime left off currently named season its pretty good
anime,not_removed,httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermaots
anime,not_removed,is this a flip flappers prequel fun fact tomas will be in charge of the music they also did the soundtrack and the ending of flip flappers
anime,not_removed,you had me at fumihiko takayama and rahxephon are some of my favorite anime of all time
anime,not_removed,sands of destruction was the western localised name i think it was named after an rpg on the ds or somethingz
anime,not_removed,i dont see lwa there also i already dropped the first season anyway so i probably wont watch it
anime,not_removed,the clash arc man the finest and longest run of chapters in the whole manga consistently excellent cant wait to see that part animated at last
anime,not_removed,its not
anime,not_removed,you are a benevolent god
anime,not_removed,i dont like it p
anime,not_removed,damn i can only get so hyped anymore and its not healthy
anime,not_removed,well i am now curious
anime,not_removed,i hope that is true
anime,not_removed,damn was there actually no set date maybe im confusing their announcement for a season with another show that got an official date oh well hopefully it comes soon
anime,not_removed,thus far winter has lwa i think its cute and animated charmingly anime harry potter is all i ever wanted this show to be no lion continuation of an excellent character study rakugo continuation of my anime of kuzu no honkai codependency the anime i find it compelling konosuba less funny but still amusing acca madhouse doing an excellent understated political intrigue masamunekun shows like this are like anime big macs bad for me and generic as hell but ill be goddamned if i dont enjoy one now and again all this and im still ignoring demichan the hot garbage kyoani is selling us to pay their rent youjo senki and that neet angel show this sub seems to be in love with snk was a show i couldnt bring myself to finish and bnha was aggressively average so my interest in is minor there are a lot more big name and high visibility shows in winter than in spring
anime,not_removed,neither nice tone you got there btw bless your parents not
anime,not_removed,in my facebook feed from crunchyroll its showing clip of characters getting wedding presents so i think wedding will be the ending of shippuden with boruto being born
anime,not_removed,its practically been one long epilogue right now so i can imagine it could end any week at this point
anime,not_removed,years
anime,not_removed,everything has light novels in fact there are some about you out there spoiler alert in my name
anime,not_removed,httpnarutowikiacomwikilightnovels
anime,not_removed,yeah there are more lns like for sakura and gaara but it seems like those wont get adapted anymore there hasnt been any word regarding that even though the shippuuden anime always announces the next arcs way before seems like itll really be over before boruto
anime,not_removed,ah thanks
anime,not_removed,it had an overarching story and kept adding characters until ed then proceeding to use some episodes to give them background as well as details to its world this one is strictly episodic where you have the salesman and cases completely unrelated to the rest
anime,not_removed,to a certain degree you are right hearthstone for the past few months had only good deck archetypes pirates reno and jade in shadowverse there are around good meta decks that you can reach masters with so in that regard it is more diverse once you get to master rank if you want to get as high as possible on the ladder you kind of have to play either daria or roach as they are clearly the most successful of the bunch at least up until the recent nerfs but yeah at the end of the day shadowverse is much better for a casual player than hearthstone and it also is cheaper for a competitive player there will always be a best deck in the meta kind of thing but that is to be expected it literally happens in every game ever
anime,not_removed,of course its confusing they both have the word hajimeru in the title
anime,not_removed,i dont think they will be mad when it actually turns out to be a loli imouto drawing doujins
anime,not_removed,as long as evil mc shows become a thing itll be k with me
anime,not_removed,the mc of that work is the personification of smugness
anime,not_removed,im looking forward to za warudo soundscreen effects when time is stopped turned back
anime,not_removed,rather than just being a spinoff its almost completely parallel to the first series and they intersect at many points even redoing scenes or at least thats how the first volumes have been very good so far
anime,not_removed,the manga runs parallel to the main manga just focused on aiz and her family the two stories overlap quite often too obviously
anime,not_removed,no it will definitely be a split cour if you google little witch academia split cour there are a ton of articles about it plus mal doesnt have it listed for next season
anime,not_removed,i think i found that comment lower in the thread lol ty
anime,not_removed,eh im still waiting for eva
anime,not_removed,ah so thats why i missed it i didnt see it till this year
anime,not_removed,yeah but the studio doing youjo senki is comprised of a lot of exmadhouse staff so its not surprising that its doing well as an adaptation
anime,not_removed,take notes berserk
anime,not_removed,tbh those shows did have very strong first episodes
anime,not_removed,big order is going to be good pretty sure most folks were talking shit about big order after the first episode there were expectations prior to that but right after the first episode those expectations were shattered by second everyone knew it sucked
anime,not_removed,i think this list isnt complete without mayoiga talk about wrong expectations
anime,not_removed,kuma miko is not comfy in the slightest it has watamote levels of cringe
anime,not_removed,i think the consensus was that big order was going to be entertaining but kitschy people werent wrong it was that it was kitschy first entertaining distant second
anime,not_removed,you win this time uartificialsapience frustration
anime,not_removed,cross ange
anime,not_removed,i really like the idea of a fantasy show that focuses more on drama than actionadventure fantasy is just a setting but a lot of the time its used as a genre so its nice to see something different hope its as good as you say
anime,not_removed,yeah ive seen that really not sure why netflix decided to name it that when its really just the between plot plus im keeping up with the manga for it just looking forward to getting more of the anime
anime,not_removed,that episode series aired right after the first season ended so it isnt really anything new it just sets up the transition into which airs some time this year
anime,not_removed,flip flap flip flap
anime,not_removed,sands of destruction was the name it was sold as in the west
anime,not_removed,indeed i loved that game and it was why i watched the anime i remember i couldnt enjoy it as much because some things were changed in localization and i liked them more as they were in the game haha
anime,not_removed,its ep so lwa db super and konosuba are my top this season
anime,not_removed,thatd be why i didnt know then
anime,not_removed,sick burn
anime,not_removed,i cant wait to see how hinata conceives boruto
anime,not_removed,if someone knows which episode was the ending to the final fight i need closure now after putting it on hiatus for a couple years since the manga finished
anime,not_removed,ah i see
anime,not_removed,it literally happens in every game ever i really need to read up on the checkers meta been out of the loop for years
anime,not_removed,im fine with this
anime,not_removed,plus mal doesnt have it listed for next season mal have it listed as both cour running after each otheras one big season and the listing for the bd suggest the two cour will come after each other or only take a small break volume episodes – – april volume episodes – – may volume episodes – – june volume episodes – – july volume episodes – – august volume episodes – – september volume episodes – – october volume episodes – november volume episodes – december so they could take a break in the spring but they cant take a longer break than that
anime,not_removed,i watched nge in its been almost years people have died waiting for the series to end
anime,not_removed,clang
anime,not_removed,the team should watch gantzo
anime,not_removed,as in good or bad i dropped it after ep
anime,not_removed,i wouldnt mind another cross ange
anime,not_removed,grimgar does that i have mixed feelings on the end of grimgar but perhaps im alone on that despite how i felt about it i think it fulfills what youre looking for pretty well
anime,not_removed,i just finished the show five days ago im now chapters into the manga p
anime,not_removed,if naruto hentai has taught me anything it involved shadow clones lots of shadow clones
anime,not_removed,shippuden episode is the aftermath of the naruto vs sasuke fight
anime,not_removed,and is the final fight
anime,not_removed,this happens in checkers though everyone is playing the same deckarmyteamcompwhateveryouwanttocallit literally of the players play the same team
anime,not_removed,im not sure about the bds but if you go to mals seasonal page its not listed as a carryover
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,it was a pretty decent gantz movie no lie 👌
anime,not_removed,oh i watch nanbaka its great i was talking more about the shows reddit thought would be good lol
anime,not_removed,yes
anime,not_removed,neither wrong expectations as in we thought people would die ulovehatedro gained the title of pointless death chart guy thanks to his continuous but vain efforts in keeping track of who was alive and who wasnt anyway it is bad
anime,not_removed,youve got plenty of catching up to do
anime,not_removed,speaking of this back a long ass time ago when i was in middle school one of my classmates told me that shippuden was ending soon and that the sequel manga had started and told me to go google it and read it at the time i had no idea that naruto hentai meant something faaaar more than what i was capable of handling at that young age simple young me thought that it was legit boy was i wrong
anime,not_removed,and sakura
anime,not_removed,ty
anime,not_removed,listing on mal say so there are some conflictions there the bddvd listing is the official one from their a schedule like that suggest it wont be split but it is still possible it will be split or will take a short break so you could be right it will just mean a tight schedule for it being ready for the bddvd like the volume but at the moment i will just look at it as a epsiode one season
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,this disgusts me on many levels
anime,not_removed,you may have been my friend sorry for damaging you but i just needed the laugh
anime,not_removed,damn dude naruto hentai is usually pretty vanilla as far as hentai goes its no spunky knight or bondage fairies or john k peta stuff
anime,not_removed,if its your first time id maybe stay away from youtube comments or even searching anything clannad related on youtube at all spoilers are everywhere
anime,not_removed,heres httpsmymixtapemoeuucgdowebm and yes this is the greatest ed of all time for reasons you dont know yet but you will oh you will
anime,not_removed,its such a simple song but its so catchy and cute i remember helping my dad build a deck i was just hammering in nails singing the dango song under my breath
anime,not_removed,first song i learned to play start to finish on the guitar no regrets
anime,not_removed,not sure if you want it but i know of a good remix of the song that gives lots of
anime,not_removed,s ptsd intensifies
anime,not_removed,i just hit episode two these feels i wasnt ready for these feels
anime,not_removed,yes please stay away from youtube while watching clannad the thumbnails ive seen spoil major things
anime,not_removed,im sorry but this comment makes me feel that theres something about the song that i missed can you please enlighten me as to why you say this i mean theres nothing i can find wrong with the song but your comment implies that its more than just a simple ending song also just realised that i have no idea what a dango is
anime,not_removed,for real it tears me up every time i hear it every time right in the feels
anime,not_removed,exactly dango dango dango dango
anime,not_removed,bahahahaha get a load of this guy episodes in and he thinks hes hit the feels
anime,not_removed,i will reiterate for that guy be very wary of spoilers they are everywhere
anime,not_removed,they use an instrumental version of the song in a lot of nagisas scenes
anime,not_removed,you sound like you havent seen the series but this track is also used as a charactersong and also a song that said character occasionally sings its pretty unique as far as that goes you dont often see oped songs used in the series itself
anime,not_removed,to be fair s the first seconds of clannad are feel city if youve played the gamewatched the show before and its not as if tomoyas struggles with depression arent made abundantly clear within the first couple of episodes which is definitely something thats going to hit some people hard personally i find there are plenty of moments early on that really choke me up
anime,not_removed,i did watch the show but the song being a character motif doesnt really equate to the praise you were giving it i understand that its her sorta pet thing she kept mentioning it after all and i recall she sang it at the end of her play but that was really about all was that all for it being the greatest ep of all time i mean its a nice song but the way you said that i thought there was something i missed like the song came back and changed in some meta way or something or there is meaning to the lyrics that i missed and i mean whats with the moon rabbit that comes out of nowhere
anime,not_removed,depression and the father growing up my mother had a severe alcoholism problem thats no longer the case but those memories are still very vivid and real and the show captured the feelings incredibly well
anime,not_removed,something doesnt need to have a deep intrinsic meaning to be great the song has significance because it has great significance in the show and theres a lot of emotion attached to it retrospectively especially after seeing after story it becomes one of the best eds in my opinion
anime,not_removed,okay so i just had to go look it up but i didnt realise there was more clannad under the after story name turns out didnt watch all of the show oops i received my copy of clannad as a transfer from my sister and i dont think she had the second season
anime,not_removed,well that would explain things theres a reason after story is in the mal top rated series of all time its an incredible experience to put it lightly
anime,not_removed,alright well ill make sure that its next on the list after i finish toradora tonight
anime,not_removed,alright bud just finished after story first of all thanks for bringing that to my attention so i could watch it second of all fuck you for bringing that to my attention so i had to watch it thirdly thanks again for getting me to watch it conflicting emotions please help fourthly i get it now i get why you said what you did about the dango song also i agree with you

anime,not_removed,looks tasty
anime,not_removed,function for hug cosplay and and id totally get it if i had the spare money though
anime,not_removed,im not sure how much interest i have if its not attached to the dragon
anime,not_removed,available now in
anime,not_removed,can you eat it yukinom
anime,not_removed,they should make dakimakura with the characters humanoid forms on one side and the draconic on the other and they should come in fafnirsama
anime,not_removed,wheres the life sized kanna one though
anime,not_removed,that looks more creepy than cure why did they have to make the meat visible
anime,not_removed,shit i love how tohru is shrugging with that look on her face she must think youre mad to buy this also how are you going to keep the tail attached when youre cosplaying
anime,not_removed,this looks like one of those weird grub things from the start of morrowind
anime,not_removed,is the girl on the corner tohru va alsothat tohru face lol
anime,not_removed,is it for eating tho
anime,not_removed,ill take
anime,not_removed,but how does it taste
anime,not_removed,dat smug tohru
anime,not_removed,this is reeeaaaalllly tempting
anime,not_removed,do want also the tail is nice too
anime,not_removed,putting this in my car permanently
anime,not_removed,be i want it ah shit
anime,not_removed,i need this as an airplane neck pillow
anime,not_removed,obviously youre supposed to get a tohru dakimakura to go alongside with this
anime,not_removed,wont get me instantly arrested the moment someone else sees it whats the fun in that
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,dat marbling
anime,not_removed,late night snack
anime,not_removed,scroll down see kanna dakimakura
anime,not_removed,being ft in i wish it came in a bigger size
anime,not_removed,i mean you can eat anything if you believe hard enough
anime,not_removed,if you go to the link for the vendor page they have the dakimakura pillow covers with her on it if you are into that kinda thing which based on your comment im guessing you are
anime,not_removed,its visible in the show and manga they want to be faithful to the source material
anime,not_removed,buttplug
anime,not_removed,make a waist strap for it
anime,not_removed,kwama
anime,not_removed,cotton
anime,not_removed,obviously youre supposed to get a tohru kanna dakimakura to go alongside with this this is the way you get arrested
anime,not_removed,well sure if you prepare it wrong
anime,not_removed,thats what they said about puffer fish
anime,not_removed,so are blowfish and people eat them
anime,not_removed,netflix and chill
anime,not_removed,mfw kanna dakimakura
anime,not_removed,you may need a full size body pillow dakimakura for hugging
anime,not_removed,nono dakimamuras are creepy life sized replicas are collectors items
anime,not_removed,oh come on she is probably hundreds of years old
anime,not_removed,no both would get you arrested your charges would be beastiality either way
anime,not_removed,everythings a vagina if youre brave enough
anime,not_removed,disappointing your parents
anime,not_removed,whatamireading please no
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,you are a saint
anime,not_removed,lifesize scale replica body pillows with lewd dragon loli not a dakimakura
anime,not_removed,if she looks like a loli and behaves like a loli its a loli regardless of her real age
anime,not_removed,probably is the operative word here im normally a lolicon but the thicc stuff for kanna is too much for me shes not just a hundred year old probably loli she also actually attends elementary school with a best friend who seems to want some kind of yuri and has an ahegao type reaction face i now understand why people judged me for liking megumin and a myriad of other lolis
anime,not_removed,i showed my mom she said it was cool and looked comfy she also watches the show though so does that count
anime,not_removed,although she only half acts like a loli she also often acts far older even in the school episode its called kanna goes to school not that she needs it so she is much more intelligent and aware than a normal child
anime,not_removed,did i even mention that she is actually a dragon a mythical beast not a human at all jokes aside i totally agree
anime,not_removed,i hadnt realized until i read your comment but kanna is pretty much a perfect incarnation of the oh that loli shes actually a year old dragon trope huh pretty obvious in hindsight lol
anime,not_removed,yeah the episode where she visits the friends house and plays twister was where i drew the line
anime,not_removed,then youll really want to avoid the manga
anime,not_removed,okay but t h i c c af
anime,not_removed,your mom watches kobayashisan does she like it
anime,not_removed,but all you see at first glance is a small girl
anime,not_removed,also see shinobu from monogatari
anime,not_removed,the killer for me is that she actually attends elementary school
anime,not_removed,all yall are fucking normies
anime,not_removed,then youll really want to avoid the manga
anime,not_removed,yes and yes
anime,not_removed,shinobu often acts her age though and has different forms where she looks like an adult
anime,not_removed,s hughes funeral and big brother ed s shichika being unhindered by togames rules as he works his way up the building and his fight with emonzaemon that was an insane episode that really blew me away s caesars final hamon s tengen toppa gurren lagann vs anti spiral that whole thing s rider vs gilgamesh s makashima slitting akanes friends throat in front of her s guts running away from rickerts place after seeing the state casca was in shit breaks my heart man s migi handle the defense chills s when a pokemon actually dies and stays dead ie latios lucario even a lot of the ones where they come back eventually hit me hard as a kid
anime,not_removed,nisemonogatari toothbrush scene its a different kind of shockinglong lasting impression but a shock anyway
anime,not_removed,for some reason the pool scene of toradora always stuck with me s taiga screaming out for ryuuji after he nearly drowned
anime,not_removed,s vash killing legato the show had a perfect build up to that moment
anime,not_removed,most scenes in clannad after story
anime,not_removed,it has to be episode of bakemonogatari really emotional and so beautifully done
anime,not_removed,ive only seen brotherhood but probably in episode when s shou fucker creates a chimera from his daughter and dog what the fuck
anime,not_removed,the s cliff scene in episode and the subsequent cliff scene in episode there was a ton of emotion surrounding both of those and comparing the first to the second showed how much the mc had progressed edit and also s the deaths of the twins as well as yukio those scenes were tough to watch and they marked a major turning point in rocks characterization theres also s robertas final confrontation with the gray fox unit its definitely one of my favorite fight scenes
anime,not_removed,s kyons declaration against the yukis overlords that if they do something to her he is going to unleash his trump card get haruhi to will into nonexistence their sorry asses i really liked it as it is what i had imagined when reading the original source material novel
anime,not_removed,receives a lot of hate especially when compared to shinkais other works but i love so much about it ive rewatched it a number of times and towards the end where s asuna breaks down and says i was just so lonely that always kills me
anime,not_removed,ping pong s nothing about you is good enough s enter the hero s heroes have no weaknesses
anime,not_removed,last scene of hxhs chimera ant arc ugly crys all around
anime,not_removed,s ye i know generic but sachis death and message at the end of the third episode hit super hard episodes in like what the actual fuck
anime,not_removed,mine would be from a show called blue submarine no the main character gets the shit kicked out of him by a shark man and the whole scene was just brutal and emotional i saw it when i was in grade and its a scene that always comes back into my mind
anime,not_removed,most recent one would be s seeing just how broken maya had become throughout exodus when she was fully prepared for billy to shoot her and after mizoguchi had saver her actually wished he had done so watching her break down in front of her niece was heartbreaking
anime,not_removed,the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya part madoka magica you were my very best friend scene episode
anime,not_removed,left a pretty big impression on me it was so beautiful and awe inspiring that i ended up falling in love with the series
anime,not_removed,opening scene of guilty crown is still one of my favorites the egoist song was perfect and the introduction to the world was great it helps me block out the rest of the anime
anime,not_removed,while i would list clannad as here i think the scene that struck me the most was from s episode of kiritsugus past you begin to understand why he is that he is and while his actions arent justified it is very fit for his personality to do so
anime,not_removed,its kind of sad because my favorite scene of all time also stuck in my mind because it made me realize that feel when no gf it makes me feel lonely
anime,not_removed,there was this one scene in when supernatural battles became commonplace that left a deep impression on me when his childhood friend loses her shit i only know that one scene from the anime
anime,not_removed,the last minutes of the last episode of your lie in april i still cry like a bitch whenever i watch it
anime,not_removed,the inn scene in spice and wolf
anime,not_removed,s konans billion paper bombs vs tobi
anime,not_removed,last episode of anohana always fucks me up
anime,not_removed,naisu naisu caesarchan
anime,not_removed,parasyte is my favorite anime the whole show was powerful to me
anime,not_removed,that scene made me realize i might have fetishes that i havent explored before xd
anime,not_removed,man i would have thought for sure that it was s when all the friends are together just before taiga and ryuuji run away and they pitch in to help them with whatever they had some of it all that they had tbh i cried like a baby
anime,not_removed,thats my favorite scene from the show
anime,not_removed,every time i see that gif of s emotionally breaking down my heart shatters
anime,not_removed,i think you owe it to yourself to watch some of the first fma anime the execution for that episode and mother are so phenomenal prevented me from watching fmab for years because i couldnt help comparing the two
anime,not_removed,i think he may be the most hated anime character of all time
anime,not_removed,youre not alone friend it is probably my favourite of shinkais
anime,not_removed,im interested what do people dislike about it
anime,not_removed,one of my favourite scenes from the show has to be when s peco gives smile the lightbulb and tells him to put his hand over it i dont know it just feels like such a strong moment of friendship
anime,not_removed,ive only seen the first three episodes of that show so far
anime,not_removed,i loved that scene sao was my first anime and that scene hit me like a across the face
anime,not_removed,ye i know generic hey i like the show to nothing to be ashamed of i know what you mean i didnt think it would be that kinda show haha
anime,not_removed,same here man i was forced into competitive piano when i was a child so the show has a lot u related with that made it extra powerful to me d
anime,not_removed,i havent seen the show before but i knew exactly what he was talking about when i saw toothbrush scene haha
anime,not_removed,while i agree on both of these i think the scene that struck me the most was in s where taiga fights sumire because of her decision to turn down yuusaku during the election speech for what she thinks is best for him you realize that she was willing to deny her own feelings because she doesnt want to weigh him down and it really made me think of the quote if you love something set it free on a different perspective
anime,not_removed,different episode but yeah
anime,not_removed,why shes not even close to best girl
anime,not_removed,thats ep
anime,not_removed,honestly what i recommend to people is to watch fma to the greed arc then switch over to brotherhood starting at that arc get the best of both worlds
anime,not_removed,i think its mostly the fantasy elements almost all of shinkais other notable works take place in a modern realistic society so people werent fans of him branching out other common comments are that the story lacked focus direction and that its setting and characters werent fully explored
anime,not_removed,youre missing out fam at first i thought it was a childrens show nope it got real definitely in my top five
anime,not_removed,not in bake but in neko shiro she can reach senjougahara shoulders
anime,not_removed,i would think that someone who faps to nekos would love hane
anime,not_removed,how interesting im still yet to check it out so i wonder which side ill sit on but at least the fantasy setting wont be a problem
anime,not_removed,at first i thought it was a childrens show nope it got real definitely in my top five thats what ive been told before ill start it up again eventually
anime,not_removed,only when she turns into black hanekawa though
anime,not_removed,black hanekawa yes regular hanekawa kys
anime,not_removed,wise choice if you get hooked on it at least the manga is out of hiatus since april so whooo
anime,not_removed,s black hanekawa is sexy but just that nothing interesting about her since there is no her at that point tiger hair hanekawa now thats a very pretty and sexy woman
anime,not_removed,didnt they start up the anime as well recently
anime,not_removed,the anime basically left off where the manga did and it was on hiatus for like two years so maybe when theres enough content theyll start up the anime one can only hope
anime,not_removed,aldnoah zero
anime,not_removed,all of gurren lagann but we still love it
anime,not_removed,that one time in yugioh where the protagonist draws exactly that one card with the help of that fucking heart of the cards he needed the most to win and not getting banned into the shadow realm
anime,not_removed,i swear it felt like every fight kuwabara won in yyh felt like an asspull
anime,not_removed,cross anges frying pan but im not even mad cause the show is so fabulous and full of yuri
anime,not_removed,in some ways haruhi suzumia
anime,not_removed,absolutely every single thing aizen did in bleach
anime,not_removed,code geass every couple episodes there is another huge asspull
anime,not_removed,most of ngnl but if i had to pick one this it would have to be the coin flip in the last episode i mean really he planned that even if he planned it to pull it off is even more unbelievable
anime,not_removed,i have to agree on soul eater the show was pretty amazing and then it dropped that on us in the last episode doesnt help that the mangas ending isnt that much better
anime,not_removed,are we talking about literal asspulls here
anime,not_removed,almost every important battle in fairy tail
anime,not_removed,s god changed his mind everythings daijoubu now
anime,not_removed,the final episodes of claymore s clare defeating priscilla somehow the final episode of akame ga kill s let me cut myself with this deadly blade which will give me a power up and allow me to move through a time stop somehow
anime,not_removed,s nagito inadvertently getting seiko izayoi and ruruka expelled though that was kind of the point
anime,not_removed,kira yamato in seed destiny
anime,not_removed,kakashi power up
anime,not_removed,the last episode of myhime what the hell are you doing you had such a good series why throw everything away
anime,not_removed,as far as things that were disproportionate in magnitude from the rest of heir series the end of noragami season felt like lazy writing
anime,not_removed,any fairy tail fight with natsu in it although i dropped it at around episode heres how every single fight with him goes dude gets beat up unable to move villain says something that pisses him off natsu gets up angry and able to fight without even eating any fire powerup asspulls are my least favorite shounen trope
anime,not_removed,if anyone says the light orbs from clannad i wont be happy
anime,not_removed,courage punch from soul eater anime
anime,not_removed,s jotaro being able to counter the worlds time stop i still dont understand how he did that can someone explain
anime,not_removed,the end of clannad as
anime,not_removed,saiki kusuo
anime,not_removed,probably the encryption breaking stuff in summer wars it is pretty absurd and the entire movie falls apart without it i really liked it anyways though
anime,not_removed,s chiekos mom showing up in the final episode and saying that shes decided not to sell amamizukan just totally derails any momentum the story had
anime,not_removed,most iktas exploits in nejimaki seirei senki tenkyou no alderamin but the one that left me speechless the most was s when he deduced that some other country manipulated the mountain tribe because their leader used a phrase holy war which as ikta later informed us later is not a term that the mountain tribe has in their language which is even more fun because the tribe leader spoke the same language the entire empire did there wasnt even anything that indicated that the tribe communicated in other language so when ikta explained it all at the end i had the same stupid expression on my face the rest of the supporting characters had
anime,not_removed,the ending of tsubasa reservoir chronicle and xxxholic also pretty much everything that ever happened in naruto that anime sucked ash ketchum never winning at the pokemon league after years befriending numerous legendaries and saving the world at least twice sasuke from naruto yeah i know i already listed pretty much everything in naruto but that cocky little authorpersona sucker deserves to be listed twice no way an ocular migraine should be able to defeat what amounts to a nuclear weapon many things in dbz great series though
anime,not_removed,honestly all the power of friendship and love bullshit my gun doesnt fire bullets by the power of friendship unless i have billions of tony leprechauns in my barrel working side by side as some kind of a happy mob family in order to accelerate the bullet to the speed of over a distance of the second thought that might finally explain why i hear a weird scream every time i fire my gun at something
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,senketsu shippu in kill la kill
anime,not_removed,you may ask what scene or part but the answer is all of it
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,the thing with ttgl is since the whole anime is an ass pull it gets us used to it and because of that nothing is an ass pull it works
anime,not_removed,funny thing every asspull is explained by spiral energy spiral energy is the energy from having the resolve to go forward since by the end of most if not all conflicts they were brimming with resolve and hope they basically had infinite power and lagann can adapt to this infinite power what can beat infinite power nothing asspulls done and explained in an anime in a decent way when i realized this my mouth was gaping
anime,not_removed,i dont think it makes sense to call it an asspull when the whole point of story is that your determination is your power asspull is when something outside of the rules established happens ttgl never does that
anime,not_removed,at least the major death isnt asspulled
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,thats nothing compared to yuma and his motherfucking s recontract universe and even if you consider all magic heart of the cards cheating legal that still doesnt excuse jaden always topdecking bubbleman into pot of greed into poly into the exact ehero fusion he needs without any supernatural assistance to manipulate his draws hes just that stupidly lucky
anime,not_removed,i think thats every time
anime,not_removed,if only kripp had that kind of top decking skill
anime,not_removed,i get salty af when my opponent topdecks the win in hearthstone i can only imagine getting sent to the shadowrealm because of it
anime,not_removed,i remember this one scene from a long time ago where yugi was giving a speech about the heart of the cards he pulls out his deck and shuffles it while still talking pulls the dark magician off the top and shows it to his opponent without even looking at it
anime,not_removed,since when were you under the impression that it wasnt an asspull
anime,not_removed,all according to keikaku note keikaku means plan
anime,not_removed,yeah but it is aizen he is like one of the only saving graces of the whole mangashow he is allowed to asspull as much as he wants
anime,not_removed,but the ride was amazing
anime,not_removed,i never get mad at jojos asspulls for some reason
anime,not_removed,yeah this has to be it its so unbelievably ridiculous that i legitmaly think it was done on purpose as a inside joke or something its the kind of thing i wouldnt come up with even if i was explicit told to think of a ridiculous twist
anime,not_removed,this what are the chances of it misfiring at that exact moment its all for the sake of forced drama
anime,not_removed,the most plot convenient joke in anime
anime,not_removed,i agree with you to some extent but asspulls to that degree are kind of the point of the show you kind of just sit back and enjoy the action of it all more than think about how bullshit op the mcs are
anime,not_removed,personally i like alot how ngnl dealt with it ridiculous for us solutions to problems are normal to characters as theyre supposed to be superior mc duo is shown as godly skilled but the full extent of their power is never shown in a shounen thats get boring pretty fast as a main plot device one punch man succeeded at pulling it off but its more of a joke other shows like naruto or fairy tail i gave here titles that illustrate it the best due to their lenght but its also noticeable in shorter ones like ttgl or klk have to limit their characters power in order to stay interesting and keep doing asspull powerups otherwise theyd simply become predictableoh look mc is going to use his ultimate laser of giga awesome deforestation on the other hand op intellectual mcs keep it interesting because while you know theyre going to win seeing them struggle and come up with crazy solutions and crazy tactics keeps it fresh of course theres a thin line between aha i predicted youd do that and did this with actual reasoning and lets do this and this which ends up being suboptimal choice which succeeds not because of rational thinking but simply because mc is supposed to win and whole universe is going to help him achieve that
anime,not_removed,what exactly happened in the manga ending
anime,not_removed,except it isnt totally so the continuation books and many theories all hint that not everything is as it seems
anime,not_removed,s actually it just powered her up and she just moved so fast that ezdeath only found her position after the time of her trump card wore off
anime,not_removed,my favorite thing about the manga s is almost the same thing happening later on and claire just getting absolutely wrecked almost as if to spite the anime ending
anime,not_removed,s you seem to forget nagitos reputation as the ultimate bullshit all of the stuff he seems to pull are asspulls lets not forget chapter
anime,not_removed,i feel like everything after s pain being one of jirayais previous students was an asspull that explanation is basically where most of the major asspulling began not necessarily being bad
anime,not_removed,lets not forget the great snake escape
anime,not_removed,the part where he activates ms
anime,not_removed,s my favorite theory is that dio didnt just have one stand but had the stands of all the joestars so dios ability to stop time was because jotaro had the ability to stop time as well when jotaro finally figured this out his used his ability to stop time within dios stopped time meaning dio could no longer move and now jotaro could still a bit of an asspull but there is reasoning behind it
anime,not_removed,lol why is this comment being downvoted do people really think this wasnt a huge asspull
anime,not_removed,there are so many fights like that in jojo though asspulling is kind of the point of jojo not the kind of powerup asspulls that you see in every generic actionshounen but the kind of asspulls that remind me of children playing on the playground and being like nuhuh i had a bulletproof forcefield around me the entire time also lets not pretend that the entirety of battle tendency and josephs entire character is one whole asspull with a capital a
anime,not_removed,im not the biggest fan of the ending but i dont think its a big asspull the supernatural stuff is laid on pretty thick in as and through kotomis arcs theres also the orbs or whatever which is kind of meh but apparently its clearer in the vn
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,this isnt really an asspull because this was predicted since the start but i agree that it is very convenient
anime,not_removed,angel beats and charlotte too if were going for feels fuckeries charlotte nuff said but angel beats ending kinda just seemed too convenient
anime,not_removed,ash ketchum never winning at the pokemon league after years befriending numerous legendaries and saving the world at least twice and hes going to school descends into alcoholism
anime,not_removed,yeah but if everything operated the way it should wed have less series bullshit nevertheless
anime,not_removed,you kinda fucked up your spoiler
anime,not_removed,your spoiler is borked
anime,not_removed,you might wanna recheck the scene he merely lost his foot
anime,not_removed,s hey remember all the deep depressing shit and drama we set up last season well forget about it nothing happened
anime,not_removed,yeah it sort of loops back onto itself and nullifies its own asspullian qualities
anime,not_removed,what can beat infinite power nothing alephnull is less than alephone is smaller less than alephtwo is less than alephthree etc of course there are things bigger than alephaleph as well infinities are weird infinite power is weird infinite power just needs to be infinitely higher in magnitude to best another infinite power
anime,not_removed,if only there was a way to know what it does
anime,not_removed,what does that card do
anime,not_removed,what an op card
anime,not_removed,i think you might have confused several scenes together because i dont remember that happening in the anime or manga
anime,not_removed,i think the problem was the setting and setup it makes sense from a writers standpoint but not really from a character one s i mean what better way to convey the power of the geass and the danger of it being uncontrolled its a command that is totally opposite to her character but for her to just run out and start shooting at them with the gun and shit was stupid and for all of them to be gathered in that stadium it would have made more sense if she killed one important japanese person todoh would have been easiest out of sight from everyone that way it could be twisted to fit each sides narrative oh and by the way lelouch never ever has this problem again if i remember correctly
anime,not_removed,oh i did enjoy the show it was just one of the shows that stuck out to me on how many times an ass pull was used
anime,not_removed,like the anime it was pretty solid until the very end s maka and soul pull some shenanigans to kill asura this time it has something to do with music instead of courage then crona is imprisoned on the moon with asura which for some reason helped bring everyone who was in danger back into safety though that wasnt really that well explained the last chapter is about boobs
anime,not_removed,this is exactly why i really enjoyed this show rather than thought it was mediocre d
anime,not_removed,she literally got s got kicked around
anime,not_removed,yep
anime,not_removed,but all the other asspulls made sense i just dont at all understand how jotaro performed that asspull
anime,not_removed,s its clearer in the vn exactly in the anime it wasnt clear enough and to me it came off as an asspull it may not be the biggest of all time but it was enough to leave me pretty upset about how the show ended
anime,not_removed,i see nothing wrong with this
anime,not_removed,i play the magic card pot of greed it allows me to draw cards from my deck
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,i love jojo ironically and unironically at the same time
anime,not_removed,he gets sick contacts thats why it never happens again
anime,not_removed,the ending and end fight was actually pretty good in my opinion just the boob part was rather confusing and i still am like what
anime,not_removed,the explicit explanation in the series is that jojo and dio have the same type of stand jojo just hasnt been using the full power of it the problem with that theory is that the stand powers are specifically tuned to personalities so no two stands should be the same the only other thing that could be the case in my mind is that dios jojo body somehow informed the type of stand that dio would get
anime,not_removed,thats fair it left a bad taste in my mouth as well
anime,not_removed,well most of the series with that kind of plot are made for the young audience to teach them about morals and difference between good and bad its to show them that good is good and that it always prevails thats why you put your hands in the air when goku casted genkidama when you were a kid
anime,not_removed,i missed the second part what does it do again
anime,not_removed,i guess ill never know
anime,not_removed,if it was me id never issue an order again because i cant take off those goddamn contacts
anime,not_removed,its pot of greed youve probably never heard of it
anime,not_removed,this image was actually posted the other day homura would probably kick tatsuyas ass anyway
anime,not_removed,well technically its not wrong i mean the system isnt magic in the typical sense edit retard me didnt even see the thumbnail
anime,not_removed,i am a good person to talk about with this
anime,not_removed,you should ask on rmanga but from my experience prince of tennis was weird but with limits then it was just weird and got worse
anime,not_removed,oh yeah im on always on here i forgot this was was just anime and yeah this new version is weird af using their mouth using two strings
anime,not_removed,i kinda got used to it after a while but it got pretty ridiculous imo thats why i love baby steps if you havent watched the two seasonsread the manga it gives me tennis hype with none of the bullshit
anime,not_removed,possibly weirder in anime
anime,not_removed,i need more kuudere in my life any romance anime where the mc gets with said kuudere would be appreciated
anime,not_removed,inspired by uacrillex ill watch the first suggestions i havent seen as long as its one cour and not glasslip httpmyanimelistnetanimelistpurplepinapples edit assassination classroom and koukara no pandora it is
anime,not_removed,id recommend shirobako to pretty much anyone here its one of the best anime of and gives you a new respect for the animators behind our favorite animes
anime,not_removed,looking for something like amagami ss anyone got any recommendations
anime,not_removed,any super intense stressfulhigh stakesintense anime bnous if super badass soundtrack something kind of like kuroko no basket but in tonemood only not really looking for a sports anime ive seen most of kaiji and thats pretty good just the animation drives me crazy
anime,not_removed,looking for delinquent chicks doing delinquent shit
anime,not_removed,looking for another week of recommendations like always feel free to recommend me a finished no need for sequels anime also sorry about that but i prefer not kill la kill or cowboy bebop i hear them a lot when posting but i just cant get interested to watch them unless they fit my other questions of today then tell me is there an action anime like sword of the stranger no need to be a samurai one were when the characters fight they actually fight instead of just talking all the time everything felt way more interesting and intense that way any anime with long black haired female main girl that im missing usually they are all fantastic only excluding tasogare otome x amnesia because i already read the manga that was great btw
anime,not_removed,pretty simple request im trying to choose between the following anime tell me what one i should watch and why baccano the devil is a part timer fatezero madoka magica yamada and the seven witches my mal is in my flair if that helps at all
anime,not_removed,i really like empathizing with a character and then having that character get torn to shreds emotionally preferrably in a psychological thriller however a drama could also work i also want it to look nice if possible httpmyanimelistnetanimelistencryptedsalad
anime,not_removed,coming up on completed shows soon so im looking for something either really good or comically bad to be my entry on httpmyanimelistnetanimelistnegusanagast
anime,not_removed,adult solcomedy ive seen shirobako it was very good anything in a similar vein mal is updated but scores are arbitrary though whose scores arent
anime,not_removed,i have a recommendation for someone looking for a new battle shounenaction show if you havent seen it yet or have never heard of it the new series my hero academia is really good its got a main character you can easily empathize with and a touching underdog story the animation is also good and is full of intense sakugareally detailed and fast animation
anime,not_removed,copying other people first one suggested i will watch
anime,not_removed,httpmyanimelistnetanimelistkillzacular still semi new to anime and trying to catch up on all the mustsee good ones i enjoy a good plot with deep characters looking for anything you experts believe i will really enjoy rating long winded examples inc kill la kill had a terrible plot but some of the best character design ever they were adorable and hilarious and the show actively made fun of itself the same applies to prisma illya hilariously awkward and i love anything fate attack on titan had a great plot but i absolutely hated every character other than levi and mikasa the characters were all very bland emotionless or just annoying which brings me to my issue with fma not brotherhood too scared i will dislike it as well fma again had a pretty awesome plot or at least concept but they didnt do much with the concept and instead you follow around an annoying brat with his much more mature and pretty awesome little brother on a long winded and moderately directionless quest angel beats fun characters little too much filler but one of the best and most emotional endings ive ever seen same applies to plastic memories hated some of the characters but that ending was pretty powerful as for clannad i thought nagisa had no character or personality at all and i was worried it would hinder my enjoyment of the show since i only really cared about tomoya and kyou then they hammered the reality of the situation enough that i felt it even though i didnt care too much in the beginning they were extremely artistic in the ways that they pushed these emotions on you and the ending was something i never saw coming while it had much better development and plot than angel beats and plastic memories the artistic style and ending was what made me enjoy it more than the actual character development season was also pointless for the entire first half fate this is literally the end all to my anime experience the anime that really got me going was sao great characters with a little development but a solid plot and amazing concept with very little filler that actually felt like it wasnt achieving something after i watched fate zero i decided to read the visual novel nothing in my life will ever be as good as the way they moved me from favoring rin to literally falling in love with a freaking picture on the screen named saber i have never had such an emotional roller coaster experience in my life as when i read this vn and i wouldnt even want to put myself through that again even though it was the best experience of my life fate has action characters plot and a very raw feel to the entire series that just hits all the marks for a good anime shigatsu wa kimi no uso your lie in april i got annoyed by the main character and it just ruined it for me i couldnt stand how long the scenes were of the waterbubbles and how self absorbed the kid was the other character was ok but there was almost zero romance in that movie to actually pull me in and get me attached all i could focus on was how long the scenes were and how over dramatic the lead character was being i know im in the minority here but this was not worth the watch for me personally finally death note death note was just breathtakingly well done amazing concept amazing plot amazing characters then it just goes straight downhill after the major turning point of the show idk what they were smoking i enjoyed the twist and it worked just fine but to then just shoehorn in a replacement was just a really bad decision that said it was still very well done and one of the best anime of all time i love how smart and well thought out each and every thought process was for each of the main characters
anime,not_removed,here we are again and i need more suggestions im not looking for anything in particular and my tastes are all over the place either suggest something to add to my ptw list or pick one of them to watch or both

anime,not_removed,currently watching your lie in april first time watching something of this genre and i havent been so attached to an anime in a long long time recommend something similar
anime,not_removed,looking for anime set in school that isnt shoujojosei preferred some romance but it doesnt have to be the main focus
anime,not_removed,kara no kyoukai maybe its not a romance its a supernatural thriller and takes place in the same universe as the fate series but the main character is super kuudere and it has one of my favorite love stories in anime
anime,not_removed,there are two main sets of characters that are followed and one of them i would either classify as a kuudere or just shy im not sure which doesnt have the main character get together with a kuudere but the main characters friend he does a little less in the show but i would still consider him a main character just not the main character
anime,not_removed,zero drama full romcom romance and comedy volleyball anime just watch the first episode even if you dont like sports
anime,not_removed,ey bud looks like you need a bit of in your life konhug
anime,not_removed,ive dealt with depression hardcore if you need a bro to talk to pm me
anime,not_removed,is really heartwarming
anime,not_removed,its not a bother at all i hope everything goes better soon mate aria kon the currently airing flying witch and for what i know also non non biyori are all really calm and feel good sol anime my personal recommendation is the story starts in a kind of a sad tone but the whole anime is actually an adorable and beautiful day by day experience i couldnt help but smile all the time while watching it for how positive and lighthearted this anime is
anime,not_removed,a little different from the other replies and im not sure if it will be your thing but has been the show that made me laugh the most so far this year its also on cr i have been in a similar boat so i probably shouldnt be attempting to give advice regardless hope things get better
anime,not_removed,kore was zombie desu ka is this a zombie literally just watch the first minute or so if youre not already in love with its comedy turn it off
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,is the closest ive found its not omnibus but its still difference romance arcs with a happy feel theres also but i wouldnt really recommend it
anime,not_removed,i didnt watch them but for what i know photokano and yosuga no sora more ecchi and for what i know its kind of weird with some relationships are similar and also have the omnibus format there is also the world god only knows that also works like that and has a plot i watched it and found all the seasons pretty good but its worth saying that season skips stuff of the manga and the story is not finished even if it ends in a pretty good point you can move to the manga then i suppose i hope i was useful
anime,not_removed,at times fits the bill of what youre looking for
anime,not_removed,chihayafuru is not a normal sports anime at all and has some really intense moments and the animation is really
anime,not_removed,how about its sports but it also has a major gambling premise like kaiji every out toua pitches will earn him five million yen but with every run he gives up he will lose fifty million yen
anime,not_removed,give a try to ajin if you liked the animation its a fantastic anime never watched knights of sidonia so i cant recommend for similars but if you look for actionromance rakudai kishi no cavalry is top tier imo it has quite a lot of ecchi tho
anime,not_removed,looking for violence shigurui or berserk
anime,not_removed,havent seen that show but my go to romanceaction recommendation is kyoukai no kanata
anime,not_removed,did you watch ajin on netflix it has the same animation style because it was made by the same studio
anime,not_removed,is close to that though theyre more like reformed delinquents
anime,not_removed,any anime with long black haired female main girl that im missing usually they are all fantastic only excluding tasogare otome x amnesia because i already read the manga that was great btw aoi hana
anime,not_removed,for action i think ninja scroll fits the list if you dont mind a movie
anime,not_removed,imo fz is amazing and the season is quite frankly a masterpiece however if i had to pick one id say madoka because well its madoka something about that show just leaves a profound lasting impression the story the artwork its just a really unique anime experience that is pretty much perfection down to every single detail art music story etc shaft ftw summary fz and fz season are a and in my book respectively madoka is a but i think madoka is the one show id pick hands down in that list
anime,not_removed,it depends what youre looking for the devil is a part timer is a great lighthearted comedy while fatezero and baccano are amazing thrillers i would suggest fatezero between the two madoka magica is an awesome psychological anime i havent seen yamada but ive read the manga and i wouldnt say it can compare to the rest of those shows fatezero baccano and madoka are all in my book
anime,not_removed,for what you liked in your mal i think its pretty clear that fatezero is the right choice imo
anime,not_removed,in this order yamada baccano madoka devil fatezero start off with the light hearted fun then go into mature then into mature dark take a break with a comedy then finish off with a critically acclaimed intense show
anime,not_removed,probably fatezero as it looks like you enjoyed ubw id say that the servants in fatezero are all much more memorable than those in ubw and the story is much more maturedark
anime,not_removed,fatezero is a happy medium between kara no kyoukai and fatestay night not as esoteric as kara no kyoukai and not as shallow as fatestay night
anime,not_removed,yamada is a great romance anime and it actually has the main character in a relationship devil is a part timer is hilarious and has some nice action scenes as well
anime,not_removed,steinsgate the anime starts innocent but i think youll get what you wish for in later episodes
anime,not_removed,texhnolyze shinsekai yori
anime,not_removed,the currently airing already had its moments and its pretty sure than ones way worse are bound to come subaru is a really enjoyable protagonist for now imo the anime has its moments of everything you mention but also has a pretty great comedy so im not sure if you want it all the time totally worth watching anyways
anime,not_removed,for really good stuff monster legend of the galactic heroes mushishi but i wouldnt recommend binging it revolutionary girl utena hunter x hunter
anime,not_removed,can i submit one that is both simultaneously the show that was so bad its dub basically became a parody of itself its a bad show in general but its absolutely hilarious because of the dub
anime,not_removed,these arent all exclusively featuring adults but still are adultlike both in humor and thememessage also we have affinity on mal thats probably my highest yet
anime,not_removed,its pretty popular around here right now im excited to get to it once its done airing because i like to binge my shounen i have high hopes for the series and i hope the anime doesnt have a cliffhanger read the manga ending
anime,not_removed,animes that i highly recommend try out a few episodes from each to see if it fits your liking amazing volleyball anime probably one of the best sports animes out there all the characters are likable and the matches can get intense it has two seasons interesting horrormystery anime it can get really gory at times so be prepared classic highly rated anime that everyone seems to enjoy a lot main character has the most op bs power youll ever see it has two seasons both are pretty enjoyable a great adventure anime similar to aladdinarabian nights has dungeons genies djinn magic swordfighting there are two seasons i think this show came out last season it has a pretty good story plot characters are good and the cliffhangers are great probably my favorite romcom anime all the characters are interestingdifferent theres a yearly rewatch for this show around christmas time since one of the major episodes occurs during christmas time i highly recommend watch this if youre into that genre on the other hand i noticed you enjoyed clannad which is super sad so i recommend you take a look at this show too it can be sad at time i like how the characters change over time i believe youll enjoy these animes consider what youve seen so far oh and i see youre currently watching steinsgate that show is amazing i wish i could watch it again for the first time a lot of people say the beginning is a bit slow but it builds the characters and their relationships up for the second half of the show stick with it im sure youll enjoy it
anime,not_removed,i have a couple recommendations that ill list below im more going for more genres than for specific recommendations since you havent watched too much those are ones that i liked a lot that would expand the genres and tell you more of what you like the ones below this are what i would consider things you really have to watch this one is special because you like the fate series so much this is set in the fate unvierse give this one some time it changes a lot i have plenty more for you if youd like them but id prioritize these ones over the others hope you find something you like
anime,not_removed,i second shokugeki no soma its so stupid and fun its a cooking show with kill la killlevel hype season is starting this july too
anime,not_removed,hourou musuko is a really good slice of life drama series gekkan shoujo nozakikun is a great comedy
anime,not_removed,hey bud heres some stuff that isnt on your ptw that you should take a look at and the rest of the heres some stuff from your ptw worth checking out hope i helped a bit
anime,not_removed,id recommend inferno cop its incredibly funny well written and perfect for a single sitting takes about minutes for the full series
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,give a try to shokugeki no souma badass guy goes to a cooking school in order to become the best chef its fantastic and really hooking season also coming next season and as a manga reader i can confirm that is as awesome worth mentioning that it has some ecchi but i think its one of the most iconic and fun ones i have ever seen during the first episode you might find it weird af but later on one is already used to and actually cant wait for them
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,yui is similar to what you describe shes got the same va and nearly the same personality as yui from
anime,not_removed,beelzebub
anime,not_removed,ptw b gata h kei is super funny the english dub is really good too melancholy of haruhi suzumiya and steinsgate are must watch series pick them up asap
anime,not_removed,gekkan shoujo has a character that remind me of echizen from your ptw list hanasaku iroha great slice of life the world god only knows funny but with a good romance aspect jinrui wa suitai shimashita really great sour humor
anime,not_removed,seems like exactly what youre looking for with added hype
anime,not_removed,comedyecchi you should definitely watch
anime,not_removed,i am looking at for a map
anime,not_removed,its my guilty pleasure imo its just a really good ecchicomedyharem show id also say that was pretty good too i also really liked the ops and eds for both
anime,not_removed,im not sure if you would call it a harem but is an actioncomedy it is more on the light side of ecchi though i would also recommend trinity seven
anime,not_removed,nana
anime,not_removed,gekkan shoujo nozakikun
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,kids on the slope if you want something really excellent sakurasou no pet na kanojo is also great
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,shigurui might be what youre looking for
anime,not_removed,possibly
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,ore monogatari was fairly good kuragehime is even better technically labeled a josei but theres not much of a difference
anime,not_removed,the only thing that i can suggest with confidence that doesnt seem to be on your list is the art of the first season might get to you but it gets better from there i dont know if it fits the genre of what youre looking for but might fit as well the gritty and dark themes both clash with and complement the whimsical art style someone with more experience might be able to find more suffering related anime
anime,not_removed,all of it
anime,not_removed,i guarantee youll like some others are
anime,not_removed,if you want cgdct then watch aria it only gets better after the season
anime,not_removed,is an anime that parodies anime based on a manga that parodies manga insanity ensues no one is safe
anime,not_removed,as you seem to really like ttgl why not watch so you can then watch both are really good diebuster is the one more similar to ttgl but you need to watch gunbuster to watch diebuster is a really fun comedy with great characters you probably will like it
anime,not_removed,maybe could fit its about a school concert band practicing for an upcoming competition performance so it has the same teamwork feeling as shirobako since the band is so big there are tons of characters although unlike shirobako there is a clear focus on about of them but almost all the characters even minor ones have some kind of character development
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,aww your mal flair doesnt have a link in it heres some easy going sol that i enjoy hopefully you havent seen these yet my favorite sol never fails to put a smile on my face a love story between an unlikely couple that get together early on in the series the story of the daily lives of art students that live in the hidamari apartments one of the shows that popularized the cute girls doing cute things subgenre an adorable adaptation a story of parenthood thats heartwarming and adorable hope one of those look interesting to you
anime,not_removed,or maybe
anime,not_removed,katanagatari an adventure following protagonists on a quest to search for legendary swords it has amazing plot progression and character development for the characters and everyone they come across if you like character growth i cant recommend anything better ps you should link a mal if you have one so people know what youve watched
anime,not_removed,heres some shows with strong main casts or characters and theres nothing that the elric brothers cannot accomplish theyre both extremely talented alchemists and together theyre very powerful great dub too while not the main character but she basically is revy is a one woman army with her dual pistols she can take down groups of mobsters thugs or criminals with ease black lagoon also has a fantastic dub spike spiegel just oozes coolness hes a talented fighter both with guns and hand to hand combat hes got excellent piloting skills as well hes just an all around kickass dude bebop has a top tier dub as well kiritsugu and his servant saber are the holy grail war dream team ones an expert mage and the other is a heroic spirit hope that i helped a bit
anime,not_removed,definitely check out as your list looks a lot like mine and thats a favorite of mine you may also like
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,darker than black black lagoon blue gender
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,in order of my favorites light yagami actually makes an appearance for a few seconds in an episode you may or may not notice him e i have plenty more if youre interested but for now id stick with them
anime,not_removed,i recommend the dub
anime,not_removed,uhhh its not on your list oreimo is the most like oreimo if thats a mistake then
anime,not_removed,well oreimo is a lot like itself and since you havent seen it yet i think thats a good place to start p
anime,not_removed,though i recommend watching the original first as for good stuff this season my current favorites are and though you may also enjoy and
anime,not_removed,rezero from this season is a must watch imo also from this season koutetsujou no kabaneri is similar in concept to attack on titan same studio too but imo is great also the main duo is really likeable i dont know what you watched other than the ones you mention so now i will list some stuff i liked with either action shonen or both if posible might have some weaknesses but damn it was hooking i couldnt stop watching until the end badass protagonist fight scenes that are just epic season when damn madhouse qq or ecchi school battle done right main girl with big anime tiddies top tier romance and holy shit the action scenes silver link did a great job with them one of my favourite anime first please i know the animation looks really weird at the start but after or episodes one is already used to and ready for a fantastic story this one has a very high chance that you will love it not much action in total but its a great mystery anime that keeps the shounen identity while giving us a nice story and a fantastic cast of characters yuno made me start watching anime wild ride with lots of action blood and a overly attached girlfriend that is both adorable and crazy af
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,heavily seconding both rezero and steinsgate and adding another one that has it and its really fucked up its a spoiler of first season so i will tag it s higurashi no naku koro ni its another top tier anime imo
anime,not_removed,steinsgate and this seasons rezero comes to mind
anime,not_removed,give a try to the currently airing tanakakun wa itsumo kedaruge most likeable entire cast of characters since gekkan shoujo and like that one there are some romantic feelings but probably wont reach more than that still a blast to watch
anime,not_removed,yamada to majo sakurasou saekano golden time chuunibyou
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,so whats cute in your opinion because cute girls usually means girls in middle schoolhigh school and theyre not really allowed to drink i guess ill go with since it has both cute girls and girls that drink
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,is the only anime that i felt legitimally scared while watching it the animation is really outdated but its a masterpiece in horror anime and the mystery elements are top tier at the end of the first arc you wont understand what did just happen but the anime does a great job in slowly revealing everything and damn its addicting and if were talking about addicting anime there is none other better than one of my personal favourites once you start this anime you wont stop until the end absolutely fantastic story
anime,not_removed,was gonna give some but our tastes seem very different so im not sure whether that would be a good idea
anime,not_removed,im never too fond of telling people what not to watch so heres some ptw stuff id prioritize all three of these are in my personal top redline and ping pong are short so knock them off your ptw quick bud sorry for not really answering your request
anime,not_removed,i havent watched a lot the anime in your ptw but id stay away from skip beat character development was okayish but the ending wasnt satisfying and i dont think that theyll ever make a second season to wrap everything up
anime,not_removed,get of your list asap actually theres merit to leaving it on your list if you tag it never watch so youll be sure not to waste your time on it its quite frankly a horrible anime theres these college students living in a boarding house where a guy likes a girl and she likes the guy sounds fine right well from here on and throughout the over episodes are the same a misunderstanding is introduced in the start of the episode and solved after minutes of useless poor written drama by the end of the episode for every damn episode its the same theres no progress no development no bonding no nothing just poor unimaginative useless drama through easily avoidable and poorly instigated misunderstandings which doesnt lead elsewhere than to a new one the next episode maison ikkoku is a waste of time
anime,not_removed,p
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,code geass for mecha with a bit of strategy durarara for gang wars and supernatural the very first episode is like half intro half someone getting kidnapped to keep you interested so im focusing on the kidnap part here for your request psychopass for cyberpunk world building cop drama the first episode is one of the best in my opinion sets up the world and gives you a good sequence noragami for spirit huntingsmall but good cast the first episode opens with him killing some giant snake spirit
anime,not_removed,kill la kill is an amazing show thats pretty much from the start
anime,not_removed,that sounds like httpsenwikipediaorgwikidannyphantom
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,check out studio ghiblis movies for example and
anime,not_removed,madoka magica
anime,not_removed,you should watch noragami
anime,not_removed,steins gate is good
anime,not_removed,id recommend flcl for something really short its a great show though its definitely a bit hard to get at first i didnt really get the most out of it until the second time around
anime,not_removed,whats the english title for the rainbow anime its just rainbow im looking to watch animes similar to claymore monster or rainbow
anime,not_removed,similar concept to log horizon and friends this one is most similar to the shows listed above but with a much larger sliceoflife flair to it a comedy in a fantasy setting the main character gets stuck with a party full of misfits and hilarity ensues this has similar pacing to the shows listed below but a similar to setting to those above it mainly focuses on economics in a medieval fantasy setting so its a nice change of pace
anime,not_removed,affinity volibearq and its sequel
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,check out its a bit heavier than soro no woto imo but definitely fits those two requirements
anime,not_removed,you could give a try i cant say this is exactly what you are looking for since i watched this over years ago and dont remember it very well what i do remember at least i think is that it was a slice of life comedy that took a slightly darker tone at least near the end again i could be making up crap since it has been so long
anime,not_removed,seconding haibane renmei and seirei no moribito texhnolyze from your ptw should also work
anime,not_removed,crunchyroll will let you watch anime with ads in a week after they release iirc hulu gives free users a limited selection of anime as well with ads daisuki has only a few of the most recent titles but they offer free hd streaming those are probably the best legal sources we arent allowed to mention illegal streamingtorrenting sites here
anime,not_removed,im not saying you shouldnt look for those illegal sites but always keep in mind whenever you watch illegally
anime,not_removed,in addition to whats listed you can find what legal sites have a particular anime at httpbecausemoe
anime,not_removed,well unless youve played the vn for fate and until youve finished kara no kyoukai probably best to not watch because its a bunch of inside jokes that dont make sense if you dont know them i tried without doing those things and i could tell half the jokes were going over my head
anime,not_removed,dont watch medaka box unless you want to watch an average action show that ends on a massive almost insulting cliffhanger httpmyanimelistnetanimelistneovrain
anime,not_removed,has a music focus worth a look
anime,not_removed,beck is a good one about a band coming together
anime,not_removed,nodame cantabile is the most music focused anime i can think of some romance but its more later in the series which is like cours i should point out that there is some romance in kids in the slope and beck not that those series are otherwise bad
anime,not_removed,nodame cantabile has some beautiful music i swear the music scenes are so great its like a different show when they start playing
anime,not_removed,is one of my favourite music based anime its set in japan and theres a lot of jazz to go around its more bromance than romance and there is some drama to keep things interesting but its very well done its not cute girls doing cute things but i think you should give it a shot
anime,not_removed,fatestay night unlimited blade works
anime,not_removed,is a pretty good one i think its one hulu
anime,not_removed,if you liked berserk you might like shigurui hellsing ultimate or kurozuka
anime,not_removed,inspired bybased on real life events otaku no video otaku culture in especially founding of studio gainax rose of versailles mary antoinette french revolution anne of green gables based on novels that are inspired by real life historical fiction ojiisan no lamp industrialization of japan kurenai no buta fascism in italy
anime,not_removed,i see it on your ptw but is based on the httpsenwikipediaorgwikitokyosubwaysarinattack
anime,not_removed,anidb has a a minute movie is my favorite of those listed here
anime,not_removed,not directly a real life event but is about what would happen if an earthquake of that caliber really did hit tokyo
anime,not_removed,heres some stuff you might like looking back on this list its a lot of sol stuff but its all great so check it out sometime i highly recommend ping pong and kon both are in my personal top hope i helped
anime,not_removed,you would probably like httpiimgurcomcmaaupbpng
anime,not_removed,if you liked you should check out some of makoto shinkais films like garden of words and voices from a distant star both are thematically similar to and look beautiful plus theyre pretty short
anime,not_removed,i recommend golden time baccano and death note
anime,not_removed,if youre looking for something similar for the race genre then initial d highly recommend this one rideback igpx immortal grand prix fzero falcon densetsu something more for the characters and comedy then space dandy more directed to the unique art style then tengen toppa gurren lagann flcl dead leaves
anime,not_removed,zegapain its definitely more than just a generic mecha show and really surprised me when i watched it
anime,not_removed,detroit metal city you cant have better taste than that revolutionary girl utena is my recommendation im surprised you havent seen it considering you have seen so much else
anime,not_removed,so feel free to post any recommendation that ive yet to watch looking at that completed list is mind boggling for years jeezus is a personal favourite of mine and one of the earlier shows i bought when i first got into anime i think its a great adventure anime with a little bit of romance thrown in as well
anime,not_removed,never watched witchcraft works so im not sure if they will fit but mirai nikki and shakugan no shana work like that the first one is pretty crazy but i found it really fun to watch i watched the first season of sns and found it pretty decent but im not much of a fan of tsundere characters of her type so i dropped it after that also i heard haiyore nyrasukosan has that and is comedy focused maybe this one is the closest to witchcraft works but i cant confirm it
anime,not_removed,relationship is like that but is more focused on comedy and references
anime,not_removed,havent seen the ones you mentioned but nana and aoi hana are good
anime,not_removed,need this as well prefer tv length doesnt matter to me
anime,not_removed,anohana bakemonogatari and the tatami galaxyone of my top are perfect for that bokura wa minna kawaisou and eve no jikan are close also your layout looks cool
anime,not_removed,not as serious as but i just sat through the whole first season of today and it was pretty good is also another show that is rather similar in nature
anime,not_removed,you could try with or theyre both heavy drama romance shows with little to nothing of comedy
anime,not_removed,you go to egypt
anime,not_removed,shouwa genroku rakugo shinjuu and cowboy bebop both are great and are frequently mentioned on this forum so you might as well get those of the list first
anime,not_removed,gekkan shoujo nozakikun haibane renmei nodame cantabile shigatsu wa kimi no uso suzumiya haruhi no yuuutsu and baccano are all really good series but in my opinion the best of your list is cowboy bebop natsume yuujinchou mushishi and ghost in the shell stand alone complex
anime,not_removed,i would power through everything else first and then finish up bebop and champloo want to end on a high note also if you like ippo try out initial d from what ive heard and little of what ive seen it is very similar in nature from art style to fighting scenes and no you dont have to necessarily be a car guy to enjoy it i wasnt and i loved it
anime,not_removed,top wo nerae gunbuster
anime,not_removed,movie tekkon kinkreet series ghost in the shell stand alone complex
anime,not_removed,it might be a slightly hitormiss anime but i enjoyed it and i thought that the visuals and soundtrack were secondtonone i just finished it and its really something different its really what youd expect from a shaftakiyuki shinbo production
anime,not_removed,death note is the goto thing if you like code geass gunbuster and one punch man are really good actioncomedy if you liked miyazaki movies you would probably like dennou coil parasyte black lagoon and darker than black are worth checking out
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,you should definately watch hxh with him its one of my favorites besides that though would probably be a comedy he would enjoy would also be good if you need something shorter than hxh
anime,not_removed,you could try going through soul eater or gurren lagann also hunter x hunter is a great idea
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,erased is a time travel mystery its not perfect but its only episodes and has a decent ending monster is a really immersive albeit long episodes mystery with a really smart protagonistantagonist seraph of the end is pretty much attack on titan with vampires
anime,not_removed,cowboy bebop parasyte the maxim fatestay night unlimited bladeworks code geass
anime,not_removed,if you liked death note you will get a similar experience with code geass
anime,not_removed,texhnolyze is definitely up there with nge as one of those mindfucks that you just must see the ending is absolutely excellent and will stick with you for some time after watch it
anime,not_removed,hey bud check out some of my favorite sol and comedy as long as sol can hold your attention a shaft show by monogatari and madoka director akiyuki shinbou its got his distinct style and is an adorable sol comedy my favorite sol series kon is an adorable beautifully animated series about a group of friends who start a band an unlikely couple get together in the early episodes and they spend the rest of the series being adorable together a comedy sketch anime thats over the top and hilarious a comedy series about the osomatsu boys a group of sextuplets that get into all sorts of silly situations first episode is hilarious hope that helped a bit
anime,not_removed,shoujo kakumei utena is a masterpiece
anime,not_removed,is very similar to ngnl in concept i dont really know how to describe this except it was entertaining
anime,not_removed,lets see great teacher onizuka kemono no souja erin kyousougiga
anime,not_removed,natsume yuujinchou is the only one on there that is among my favorites penguindrum and ga rei zero are my runners up
anime,not_removed,penguindrum natsume assassination classroom
anime,not_removed,heres my top of stuff on your ptw dystopian scifi police thriller its got a bit of gore but season was pretty great cute girls doing cute things theyre art students and its adorable a fun movie with a family theme cute and quite a bit of fun hope i helped a bit
anime,not_removed,my top three from your list are in order the one id be most comfertable making a blanket recommendation would be kekkai sensen though hidamari is a must if you like sol and mawaru penguindrum if you want a story that takes a bit of thinking to fully unravel
anime,not_removed,i really enjoyed shakugan no shana just started the second season rokujouma is pretty generic but it gave me a lot of good laughs
anime,not_removed,jojo why havent you watched the second half of stardust yet it is significantly more engaging that the first half should watch that asap chaika doesnt do anything too crazy but its pretty enjoyable from start to finish and chaika is also adorable joukamachi no dandelion is an extremely underrated sol its got a great cast a touch of romance and best of all it actually has a conclusive ending
anime,not_removed,great teacher onizuka and parasytekiseijuu are on my top anime so yeah both are fantastic imo my third pick would be ef a tale of memories beautiful romance anime with lots of feels
anime,not_removed,another is pretty creepy until it turns into s final destination
anime,not_removed,youre going to be hard pressed to find scary anime it just doesnt really happen the only two series ive seen that even had one scene where i was scared was and they are the closest ive seen to an actually scary anime
anime,not_removed,i havent seen a creepier anime than perfect blue
anime,not_removed,boogiepop phantom is incredibly unsettling throughout i had to pace myself watching it because it was just so strangecreepy shiki is also pretty good
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,you should make a my anime list account it makes it easy to keep track of what you have watched parasyte fatestay night ubw hunter x hunter kekkai sensen jojo fullmetal alchemist brotherhood one punch man could probably think of more depending on when recent is
anime,not_removed,hunter x hunter yu yu hakusho fatestay night ubw fatezero jojos bizarre adventure one punch man
anime,not_removed,fatezero
anime,not_removed,action drama military scifi space
anime,not_removed,neon genesis evangelion texhnolyze berserk monster hunter x hunter trigun mushishi gankutsuou revolutionary girl utena
anime,not_removed,oh wow congrats bud heres some great stuff thats missing from your list ive starred the shows id watch before if i were you hope i helped
anime,not_removed,porco rosso jin roh detroit metal city hourou musuko suzumiya haruhi no yuuutsu these are my favorites along with bebop a bunch of variety hopefully you find something you like
anime,not_removed,aoi hana
anime,not_removed,if you want the full gamut of romance in an anime try giving a shot it manages to capture a large spectrum of romantic emotions through its run and has some very relatable moments
anime,not_removed,yuru yuri and sakura trick are great feel good shows and are definitely cute mikakunin de shinkoukei is also a pretty nice series
anime,not_removed,natsume yuujinchou does both things
anime,not_removed,is for feel good it is about a girl who wants to get her wish granted in order for it to be granted she has heal others hearts by helping them out it was a relaxing watch
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,if you havent seen one punch man yet thatd probably do it
anime,not_removed,gunbuster is a lot of fun
anime,not_removed,you dont have white album on your list so maybe youd want to watch that its pretty good
anime,not_removed,first season of is pretty good too
anime,not_removed,kara no kyoukai ghost in the shell stand alone complex
anime,not_removed,madoka magika neon genesis evangelion subete ga f ni naru
anime,not_removed,also fits well
anime,not_removed,try code geass its not really gory but it is certainly is similar to some of the shows youve listed also shiki like unhilden said
anime,not_removed,try ergo proxy if youre looking for a mature dark and very psychological anime its one of my favourite shows
anime,not_removed,this is very specific and im kinda drawing a blank best i can think of is maybe these are not harem just normal romcom
anime,not_removed,it really helps if you have your shows ratted top only tell you so much slow drama fun action
anime,not_removed,for a more comedic series for a more calming series
anime,not_removed,you want mind battles you say
anime,not_removed,fatezero
anime,not_removed,i would recommend zetsuen no tempest akagi or kaiji for the mind games
anime,not_removed,monster
anime,not_removed,i havent seen rolling girls but going off the name since the pick is girls and a motorcycle
anime,not_removed,kill la kill is a darker sexier rendition of the first two episodes if youre into that
anime,not_removed,amagami ss has conclusive endings and no love triangles
anime,not_removed,maybe a relationship that actually goes somewhere
anime,not_removed,from your ptw anne happy nichijou sansha sanyou
anime,not_removed,for you
anime,not_removed,im sorry but you arent going to get the same feelings from horror anime that you do from horror movies that disconnect between animated works and reality that allow for a greater suspension of disbelief works very well fantasy scifi and unrealistic action anime but it works against the horror genre that said some decent horror anime are i dont think you will find them scary though
anime,not_removed,ill second higurashi
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,honestly i dont think any anime is really scary but higurashi is the creepiest one for sure also a masterpiece imo
anime,not_removed,psychological horror and violence boogiepop phantom
anime,not_removed,i want pure shocking creepy horror seconding since its like a horror movie if you dont mind gore and mindless horror if you want something more of a mystery horror
anime,not_removed,i say
anime,not_removed,give baccano a shot its by the same writer as durarara but is set in america with a big cast its only episodes and the dub is great
anime,not_removed,post your mal or some sort of list so people know what youve already seen for heartwarming anime barakamon non non biyori
anime,not_removed,from this season
anime,not_removed,definitely rezero although it has drama it has great comedy as well grimgar is more slow paced and serious overall
anime,not_removed,grimgar had a sad tone through the whole story and imo was way too slow paced still pretty good rezero is a lot better for now tho but have clear that its not just a comedy like konosuba at all the serious and dramatic moments are constant but i have to say that its perfectly mixed with really funny moments and interactions if that counts i rated both konosuba and for now rezero with a and kazuma and subaru are pretty much indentical but in different settings so i really think you should give it a try
anime,not_removed,if character development and great interactions is what you want spice and wolf is perfect for you
anime,not_removed,hmm those are romcoms that get a bit gloomy i guess so with a bit of a stretch id say you would enjoy and the second season at least
anime,not_removed,before texhnolyze haibane renmei monster youll really like this if you liked the mystery in erased ergo proxy mushishi gurren lagaan baccano before berserk revolutionary girl utena legend of the galactic heroes trigun cowboy bebop serial experiments lain neon genesis evangelionthe end of evangelion all of these are pretty widely discussed and span a massive variety of genres theres definitely one youll liked amongst them
anime,not_removed,cowboy bepop and neon genesis evangelion in your ptw
anime,not_removed,berserk
anime,not_removed,seconding berserk theres also
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,have you seen the film some of the most insane sword fights ive seen in anime its also a pretty short movie so give it a watch sometime
anime,not_removed,katanagatari no question if you want swords and swords for your swords then this is the anime for you
anime,not_removed,is an sol taking place in the countryside so it has a similar feeling as nnb without the moe the main characters are a yo calligrapher and a five yearold village scamp no trumpets
anime,not_removed,what was wrong with kon in your eyes its my favorite sol heres some sol that might hit the mark instead heres some of my favorite action stuff hope i helped a bit bud
anime,not_removed,airing this season is really comfy and relaxing
anime,not_removed,tanaka kun is airing and its great
anime,not_removed,sora no woto post apocalypse kon but much better imo kino no tabe travelling around a strange world of city states
anime,not_removed,have you sen its story escalates a bit like ttgl but klk goes wide whereas ttgl goes tall
anime,not_removed,flcl maybe its only episodes long but its definitely the same sort of over the top action as ttgl
anime,not_removed,one punch man boku no hero academia both of them are worlds of heroes and the struggles of living in them your mal tag is blank so sorry if youve watched them however in the off chance you havent already seen both i must tell you these are the most hype series in the last few years if not decade so clear your schedule
anime,not_removed,try kill la kill just dont be dissuaded by the fanservice stuff it gets really awesome after a few episodes and its from the same creators of gurren lagann nevermind lots of people already suggested it xd
anime,not_removed,honestly theres a ton of good stuff next season idk how big your plate is but this is what i would look out for relife orange mob psycho battery amanchu days masou gakuen hxh and if youve seen the prequels handakun not sequel but i assume it will be better if youve already seen barakamon shokugeki dgrayman hallow most of that stuff is what im personally looking forward to im probably gonna be watching upwards of
anime,not_removed,gonna second orange its one of the most popular shoujos right now even among male readers im so hyped for it loved the manga
anime,not_removed,for guilty pleasure you could try sakura trick its only episodes so its pretty quick based on your list it may not be up your alley but it does rank for cute girls its yuri as well so ignore this if thats not your thing it was a little silly and over the top sometimes but overall it was fun and fairly sweet i actually enjoyed it because it was so much lighter than what ive been watchingreading lately
anime,not_removed,try baccano
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,the two animes with the best visuals ive seen are which is about mages in a competition in which they get to summon servants who are actually mythologicalhistorical figures to fight one another though the pacing may be a bit slow at times especially during season two neet geniuses are sucked into a fantasy world where all disputes and conflicts are done through playing games theres also my personal favorite show of all time while the visuals may be slightly worse than the ones above by no means bad an certainly way above average the characters and story make up for it it has a slow start and the tone varies wildly between story arcs so stick with it
anime,not_removed,if you count racing as action should interest you its a highoctane popcorn watch with some of the best animation out there
anime,not_removed,if you havent already seen it is also unnecessarilly well animated especially for a slice of life
anime,not_removed,go watch nozakikuns special episodes right now theyre as awesome as main series we have affinity not bad you might like noragami second season is even better
anime,not_removed,flcl is the first thing i can think of but its popular so you probably watched it
anime,not_removed,check out it fits all of your criteria and has an excellent dub
anime,not_removed,great action characters and english dub
anime,not_removed,if you havent seen it yet either
anime,not_removed,not z has quite a lot of this
anime,not_removed,hajime no ippo yu yu hakusho
anime,not_removed,berserk
anime,not_removed,movies plus three epilogues mature brutal supernatural thriller its a slow burn and very confusing at first but has a badass female protagonist and one of my favorite love stories in anime episodes fantasy action set in feudal japan some incredible fight scenes top tier writing and character development super cute romance between the two main characters
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,try out obsessed with airplanes sounds like involving kids in a club who switched bodies a few times i also know one of them said ive masturbated to you before definitely
anime,not_removed,edit the second anime youre talking about sounds like
anime,not_removed,is about a guy from the city who goes to work at an agricultural school a bit different in its overall feel but is pretty similar nonetheless if you were watching souma for other reasons then id point you to
anime,not_removed,yakitate japan its not hd though
anime,not_removed,you should consider while it has its comedy moments its definitely a violent gore fest and its something that you might like since you liked elfen lied probably not as emotional deep as elfen lied imo but its still good it was actually written by the same person that wrote el
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,not quite sure the flavor of quirkiness you are going for so here are a few options you gotta love how embraces the cutecrazy haruhi embodies spontaneity plus im sure she would be if you ignored her so many choices here how about the queen of trolls if by quirky you mean batshit crazy then excel is your girl rather the anime itself is excel is hypergenki i suppose
anime,not_removed,go with off your ptw its pretty similar to rezero
anime,not_removed,for something more comedy focused
anime,not_removed,blue gender
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,the movie series is really dark its set in the same universe of fate and its animated by ufotable as well
anime,not_removed,jin roh mawaru penguindrum
anime,not_removed,i believe ano hi mita hana no namae wo bokutachi wa mada shiranai is about as similar as youre gonna get
anime,not_removed,shoujo ai wasnt sure if this counts comedies without romance
anime,not_removed,i saw bakuman after a friend reccomended it and my god the tension when the results of voting came out was more tense than light vs l or any other mainstream outwitting battle eiji is probably best character too crooooowwwwwww lol loved it rated it definitely reccomend to anyone who wants to know how the manga world workds or rather shonen jump world with romance as the glue that keeps it together
anime,not_removed,and when not its still amazing heavily seconding this one also season coming next season hype
anime,not_removed,this looks interesting ill give it a try thanks
anime,not_removed,thats the most interesting suggestion esoteric too im sure thanks ill look into it
anime,not_removed,forbiddenlove watched the first episodes and it was pretty good i will keep watching thank you
anime,not_removed,yeah i second this fits ops description perfectly
anime,not_removed,i see you went with comically bad 😇
anime,not_removed,i saw a clip that got posted here recently and was meaning to check that out thanks for the recommendation
anime,not_removed,i hope the anime doesnt have a cliffhanger read the manga ending from what ive been hearing its probably going to have a read the manga ending
anime,not_removed,thanks ive added both of these ive been on a comedy kick recently so i will probably check out gekkan shoujo nozakikun sooner rather than later
anime,not_removed,monogatari looks intimidating in terms of volume but it has been a few weeks since my last long series so i will give it a go between baccano wttnhk monogatari and jojo which do you think i should start next also thanks
anime,not_removed,tonari no sekikun is a really underrated comedy short really worth giving a try too uhungrysadhippos
anime,not_removed,gave tonari no sekikun a try and am loving it so far thanks for the rec
anime,not_removed,i think its also worth mentioning that the ecchi becomes toned down a lot as the series goes on to the point of having almost none at the end of the first season
anime,not_removed,i just tried to watch the first episode but remembered i was a poor college student i might have to wait on this one until i get money to buy better food
anime,not_removed,you linked your lie in april twice
anime,not_removed,thanks for the recs ill probably try to watch grimgar soon but im not ready for your lie in april until i go buy some tissues
anime,not_removed,great thank you
anime,not_removed,thanks ill check it out
anime,not_removed,sounds good ill do that thanks
anime,not_removed,cool thanks
anime,not_removed,yeah i have already watched it and it was awesome
anime,not_removed,thanks i will check that one out
anime,not_removed,at one point i was debating on watching this one but i will check it out for sure now thanks
anime,not_removed,ill have to check those all out thanks for all the recommendations
anime,not_removed,okay cool i will check em both out thanks
anime,not_removed,uhmmm yesthis looks amazing its like you touched my brain thanks for the suggestion
anime,not_removed,tokyo ghoul was cool when cool shnizz was happening somehow i dropped off of it i want to get back on it his hair just went white lolz i think he was being a huge pussy and i took a break but i want to finish it thank you
anime,not_removed,this is a good one i didnt realize it was so recent
anime,not_removed,this looks great thanks man
anime,not_removed,kuragehime sounds awesome is it a romcom though regardless thanks for the rec definitely gonna watch it
anime,not_removed,tried yuyushiki and didnt like it sometimes i find the comedy of a show just doesnt click with me
anime,not_removed,i ve seen kon ore azumanga and hidamari i just dont like an anime with full girls thank you for the answer gonna try usagi drop
anime,not_removed,i ve seen flying witch so far gonna try usagi drop thank you
anime,not_removed,watched shokugeki last year and loved it il look into some of these other ones thanks
anime,not_removed,from the new world it is thanks
anime,not_removed,oh boy i dont know if my minds ready
anime,not_removed,all added to my mal much appreciated for the detailed reply
anime,not_removed,i have watched out of you have listedi am looking foward watching ajin and zetsuen no tempestthank you for taking your time to reply i appreciate it
anime,not_removed,once you start this anime you wont stop until the end absolutely fantastic story i know watching it while it was airing was hell so many cliffangers it made waiting a week for the next episode so tough i second parasyte and higurashi both were awesome
anime,not_removed,ill give you the movie but i wouldnt call a normal seasonal show short these days even if its a couple episodes shy of the full cour all three of those are good examples of anime i know are wellregarded but dont have a strong opinion about and thus am saving until im in the mood for that specific kind of thing i might get around to ping pong a little sooner even if im not actively seeking it out but probably not this year
anime,not_removed,awesome ive been planning on watching durarara i just never got around to it cause the name didnt catch my attention ive seen psychopass and noragami sounds badass ive always avoided code geass because of the art style i would guess i would get used to it after watching a bit but i just never felt intrigued thanks though
anime,not_removed,now that you say that i realize that is what my description sounds like but i assure you i was being serious
anime,not_removed,i have watched spirited and i think i have watched the first one when i was younger did it have a scary giant boar in it what do you think about totoro ive been thinking about watching it for a while
anime,not_removed,affinity herehow i do second clannad and clannad after story they are masterpieces though i should warn that the first episodes or so of the first season are a bit slow
anime,not_removed,there are no references to kara no kyoukai in carnival phantasm if there are any they are very minute
anime,not_removed,aw man thats too easy then i wasnt gonna watch this until i finished all of that anyways
anime,not_removed,hmm yeah youre right there isnt much in your ptw id have to say skip plastic memories they base their whole story on the giftia system yet its extremely flawed but not in the flawed so we can have a plot way its just completely unbelievable
anime,not_removed,it does look konish down to the knockoff mugi in that cover think id like this thanks
anime,not_removed,look promising ill check it out thanks
anime,not_removed,havent heard of any of them besides rov nice ty
anime,not_removed,thank you ill definitely check these out
anime,not_removed,not a big fan of shounen and i have read death note but tq
anime,not_removed,where do i start there seems to be a lot thanks
anime,not_removed,ah yes zegapain i came across it a while back and added it to my ptw while im not the most interested in mecha anime some interesting and unique mecha anime can always be interesting thanks for the recommendation
anime,not_removed,im surprised you havent seen it considering you have seen so much else its because it has episodes p and i tend to hold of onto longer than episoded anime series but as it was already on my ptw with a medium priority ill put it on my watching list thanks for the recommendation
anime,not_removed,oh cool this is an anime i did not have in my ptw yet so that sure is quite interesting ill make sure to give it a watch
anime,not_removed,aoi hana seem to be most similar to what im looking for i think ill try that one
anime,not_removed,in case you didnt see the post i made just before you i recommend aoi hana and nana
anime,not_removed,also your layout looks cool thanks anohana bakemonogatari and the tatami galaxy i dont know after reading the synopsis of each the only one to be somewhat similar is anohana but it seems to lack in romance does any of them have a romance building up early and then they are separated for some reason which leads to an emotional struggle because of the distance between them
anime,not_removed,they seem good and ill probably watch both of them someday but its not really what im looking for atm but thanks anyway
anime,not_removed,not even sure why i havent completed bebop yet but seeing as im so close why not i suppose as for shouwa loved the first couple of eps so i think ill move that up on the priority list
anime,not_removed,i would power through everything else first and then finish up bebop and champloo want to end on a high note not a bad way to look at it ill probably finish bebop sooner but i can always end on champloo also if you like ippo try out initial d from what ive heard and little of what ive seen it is very similar in nature from art style to fighting scenes and no you dont have to necessarily be a car guy to enjoy it i wasnt and i loved it actually ive seen about eps of initial d and liked what i saw so im not sure why thats not on my watching list i am a car guy so its a good series in that respect for me it is another show thats been a long time wanting to finish but just havent done it type of thing
anime,not_removed,thanks
anime,not_removed,ghost in shell havent watched it but heard of it neither have i seen the movie or heard it thanks
anime,not_removed,ah i forgot we watched the first episode of cowboy bebop together but it was fairly slow and im not sure if hes interested in more ill ask him tomorrow
anime,not_removed,sounds good i actually tried the first ep a while ago but found it rlly slow does the pace pick up later on
anime,not_removed,thanks will probably start kon or nichijou after i finish nichibros
anime,not_removed,ive seen it and really enjoyed it
anime,not_removed,ive owned the gto boxset for years might be time i pull it out of storage the shirt that came with it was my favorite pj shirt forever
anime,not_removed,ive been wanting to check out natsume forever the length was always daunting though more so since i saw miyuki sawashiro on the list of vas is it a slow paced episodes a time show or one that hooks you into a binge type pace i get caught up in good shows
anime,not_removed,ive been meaning to check out summer wars and its barely any commitment ive heard good things about psycho pass too
anime,not_removed,i watch most of my sol type shows with my kids as it slows me down out of the binge watch mentality ive learned to enjoy them a ton more since i started doing this flying witch is the family favorite seasonal show ill line up hidamari sketch to watch with them after we finish barakamon thanks
anime,not_removed,haha i actually watched nothing but jojos back to back for a few days to get that far and i needed a break at that point i was missing a mixture of roundabout young joseph its on the horizon for sure
anime,not_removed,yes i liked another one of the few that i got around to watching
anime,not_removed,yeah ive pretty much realized there isnt a ton thanks though shiki was on my maybe list ill probly check it out
anime,not_removed,i just watched the trailer and i am intrigued thanks
anime,not_removed,oh yeah i heard about boogiepop and totally forgot thanks
anime,not_removed,jeez man seeing aoi hana being mentioned makes me a happy guy
anime,not_removed,thanks for the recommendation ill check it out
anime,not_removed,i heard some good things about this one but i was a bit sceptical about it but in all honesty ill give it a try
anime,not_removed,i have i just completely forgot to add my mal link ive seen plenty of stuff
anime,not_removed,ill check it out
anime,not_removed,i forgot about that thanks for the recommendation
anime,not_removed,i still need to finish this series
anime,not_removed,thanksn there were some that i didnt know of i think i will watch girls und panzer first as the movied just been released
anime,not_removed,gotcha gonna watch it tonight then
anime,not_removed,this is my mal
anime,not_removed,already seen
anime,not_removed,fucking white album crushed me
anime,not_removed,already seen that p
anime,not_removed,thanks ill check it out
anime,not_removed,i dislike how kon is so cute thanks for the suggestions ill look into them
anime,not_removed,thanks ill check it out
anime,not_removed,thank you
anime,not_removed,thanks ill check them out
anime,not_removed,no i havent seen it but just heard few good recommendations about that anime going to check it out thank you
anime,not_removed,just started kill la kill but i will check it out later thanks
anime,not_removed,im pretty new to anime so i really havent added any animes to my mal yet except plan to watch its full of them i have seen one punch man and waiting for boku no hero academia to finish airing before jumping in thanks for answer
anime,not_removed,already episodes in even though i dont like too much fanservice but klk reminds me of ttgl and i really like fighting animations
anime,not_removed,ive always gotten excellent recommendations on this subreddit ill check it out thank you
anime,not_removed,about to give this a go
anime,not_removed,looked up the description sounds pretty cool
anime,not_removed,not overly against comedy in all cases just pure comedy series arent my think to me most of the comedy doesnt translate and ecchi comedy ie omg i fell on kawaiichan and i grabbed her boobs by mistake inc bloody nose and slap in his face
anime,not_removed,definitely a fantastic show cant wait for the summer season to start so i can watch more of it
anime,not_removed,did you watch the sequel movie miraihen aka future chapter
anime,not_removed,monogatari seemed daunting to me but the way its structured makes it easy to just watch one installment put it down for a bit and then watch the next id recommend trying out bakemonogatari and then if you arent into it because the monogatari series is pretty polarizing pick up jojo for a longer series to get into jojo part one the first episodes of the mal entry i linked is rather lackluster but once part gets into gear its nonstop hype baccano is great if youre looking for something thats easy to watch in one or two sittings only episodes and its quite gripping
anime,not_removed,oh damn it thats my bad been working all week and im exhausted fixed now d
anime,not_removed,funny i didnt see it on the list you had i must have missed it sadly then i dont have any recommendations for you as the few comedies ive seen that i can recommend youve watched as well hope you find something though
anime,not_removed,no problem enjoy and let us know whatever you decide to watch and what you thought about it im almost ashamed to say it but i really enjoyed ts and i know theres a community here that definitely refuses to give comedyecchiharem shows due credit haha
anime,not_removed,if his hair just turned white then you finished the last episode of the first season there was a second but it was really bad id recommend picking up the manga instead
anime,not_removed,its not really a traditional romance story more comedy with dramaslice of life
anime,not_removed,seriously its so similar to yuru yuri im surprised well definitely give those other three a go
anime,not_removed,just one thing after finishing usagi drop dont look for the manga finish or anything trust me just leave it at that when you finish
anime,not_removed,it can take multiple watches to make heads or tails of what is going on well worth it though
anime,not_removed,thats fair i consider a show short if it can be easily watched in or less sittings bingable or low episode countruntime episodes doesnt take too long but youre right its no ova or movie
anime,not_removed,noragami was one of the shows to get me into anime so i really appreciate it but if it feels like not enough is happening in the first season twelve episodes the second season kicks the plot into full gear durarara is really interesting and i love a lot of the characters but when its an episode focusing on a character you dont like it can be rough it pulls off plots converging together really well though the art is cg is weird im only currently watching it myself because its my best friends favorite show the people look like noodles but i feel like you get used to it and its plot has no brakes so its an easy one to binge
anime,not_removed,ah i just assumed because there were characters that i didnt know and i knew they were in the same universe and i hadnt watched kara no kyoukai at the time
anime,not_removed,welp im not sure what else because whatever is on your ptw that ive seen id say was worth the watch at least
anime,not_removed,awesome i hope you enjoy them
anime,not_removed,then il just recommend psychopass instead of death note
anime,not_removed,depends on which genre you want if youre in it for the racing then definitely initial d
anime,not_removed,i didnt thank you edit btw im gonna try aoi hana
anime,not_removed,anohana is kind of the reverse the separation comes early but dont worry is full on romance the tatami galaxy is really different boy meets girl falls in love and they start to get close the thing is that this happens times in different ways and some times the outcome is not the same i really recommend it its a romance but its also about life itself but if you want exactly something with the build up romance and later struggle of separation your best shot is planetes is a lot like voices of a distant star
anime,not_removed,i recommend anohana it was a great show i may have to rewatch it now
anime,not_removed,both of the shows got progressively better towards the end so youre in for a good watch o
anime,not_removed,id give it until about episode the first few episodes really set the tone of the series the struggle of the mc s as he pulls himself through the city with his armleg ripped off trying to survive for example and let you get to know the characters then the first half picks up significantly and the second half is absolutely brilliant
anime,not_removed,hey awesome i hope you enjoy kon i think its awesome i thought nichijou was really silly as well enjoy bud
anime,not_removed,it is episodic so you can go at your own pace easily i have only watched the first season but i watched it over the course of about months some episodes were really good so that you just have to keep watching while others make you feel as if you hit a good stopping point for the day
anime,not_removed,its a nice way to spend an afternoon great dub too
anime,not_removed,ok in that case check out cowboy bebop or gurren lagaan
anime,not_removed,definitely you havent even gotten to best girl yet
anime,not_removed,so youre not a fan of moe thats a shame but its something that grew on me the more anime i watched so you might learn to enjoy it someday
anime,not_removed,get to episode or and you wont be able to stop watching
anime,not_removed,i had the same problem with both it was tough to get excited about them at first i feel like if you make it past the first episodes for psychopass and steinsgate you may just end up marathoning them i know i did i know this kinda mirrors ubuttpolices comment but its really true the hook builds in both shows and snatches you at one point
anime,not_removed,yeah i definitely wouldnt say that this show is pure comedy its a gore fest first and foremost but it does have its lighthearted comedyecchi moments
anime,not_removed,thanks for the quick responsesgoing to start bakemonogatari
anime,not_removed,ah no problem thanks anyway d
anime,not_removed,like after he gets tortured and kicks some ass and decides to make a stand that was the last episode
anime,not_removed,wouldnt say it was really bad but it definitely was disappointing i had no idea what was happening of the time and we barely saw the main character at all during the entire season
anime,not_removed,ill give it another shot but iirc i watched the first eps and wasnt impressed felt like the wordplay was lost on me
anime,not_removed,yeah thats what ive heard a lot of people joke that even lain fans dont know what happened lol
anime,not_removed,alright i will probably watch all of them eventually planetes has been on my ptw for a while now maybe its time for me to give it a go
anime,not_removed,thats great thank you will start it after i finish last exile
anime,not_removed,im good with either would you recommend either sub or dub as having an edge i usually lean towards sub unless it has spice wolfsteinsgate quality acting
anime,not_removed,i started it i just put it on hold a while ago its just hard for me to get through it was the same with samurai champloo
anime,not_removed,ik but its on my ptw for a long time and it is also the kind of show i need i think i am going to watch girls und panzer at the same time as suggested by the other comment
anime,not_removed,ehh it just isnt entertaining for me thanks again for the suggestions
anime,not_removed,sounds great i hope you enjoy it as much as i did
anime,not_removed,yep
anime,not_removed,ive only seen it dubbed but id say its pretty close to sg dub quality i watch a lot of my anime movies dubbed and hosodas flims have pretty good dubs generally
anime,not_removed,no prob bud hope you enjoy the rest of my recommendations
anime,not_removed,well・・
anime,not_removed,i dont think theres an original made by the actual artist the most accurate to the original song though would probably be animenzs version its a lot more difficult than the one you have though httpsheethostsheetcogvyk
anime,not_removed,please dont miss the after credit scene
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,damn this really heals the soul what a glorious thing to look forward to every week
anime,not_removed,jeebus does aichan have that many blouses where she can afford to pop one button per week lol
anime,not_removed,aichan is the best girl still not sure how to feel about their relationship though
anime,not_removed,i love this show brightens up my mondays i read through all the mangaimages too great stuff in there
anime,not_removed,oh man were already at the part time job wonder if theyll tone down that part or keep it to the same
anime,not_removed,while i know people find this creepy i actually find the show really sweet also im pretty sure the the faceless mc knows what kind of situation hes in and does his best to hold back from doing something inappropriate with aichan
anime,not_removed,i dont get it whats healing about a teasing relationship between a high school girl and a salary man eating her up with his eyes
anime,not_removed,shes definitely eating him up for real
anime,not_removed,s but in the manga he already did
anime,not_removed,i find everything cute to be healing work and life just drains me their interactions are cute
anime,not_removed,which image is this
anime,not_removed,it always starts at ow thats so cute im so jealous of this guy but then i remember shes even at should i find myself on a situation like that i would be really weirded out
anime,not_removed,seems they deleted the original pic
anime,not_removed,which is why i can enjoy this as its an anime and not real life
anime,not_removed,bump
anime,not_removed,maybe white album there is also the currently airing kuzu no honkai actually toradora might over more of what you want
anime,not_removed,nisekoi haremromancecomedydafuk okusama ga seitokaichou fresh ecchicomedyromance and finally relife simply great and kinda realistic
anime,not_removed,saenai heroine
anime,not_removed,prison school isnt terribly realistic but doesnt have any real scifi or fantasy elements ecchi high school comedy not really any romance maybe youd like shimoneta another ecchi comedy if youre okay with incest i think kiss x sis fits what youre asking for
anime,not_removed,if you move past the art style which i loved try aku no hana definitely an alltime favorite
anime,not_removed,upvote for wa
anime,not_removed,this submission has been removed the content of your post does not appear to fit httpwwwredditcomranimewikiruleswikieverythingpostedheremustbeanimespecific have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,amano yukiteru from mirai nikki its not even that hes a wuss hes also just poorly written and not interesting in any way
anime,not_removed,the only protagonists that have ever made me consider dropping a show are incredibly bland ones like kirito as long as they have something interesting about them ill find myself enjoying the character at least a little
anime,not_removed,using superlatives in a subjective medium annoyedkirito inaho wins the cake for me his biggest quirk is a meme about eggs
anime,not_removed,ichika fucking neutron star
anime,not_removed,naruto hes obnoxiously naive and his morality is so twisted also the story favors him way too much i thought it was supposed to be an underdog story about a kid discriminated for things he had no control over and trying to reach recognition by hard work not a this was destiny youre the chosen onetype of story
anime,not_removed,not every word needs to be capitalized
anime,not_removed,hikaru ichijou i wanted to reach through the screen and slap him so many times
anime,not_removed,ash ketchum piece of shit doesnt deserve a lead and definitely doesnt need episodes of him
anime,not_removed,k i r i t o
anime,not_removed,kei kurono from gantz dude threatens to throw a girl out on the street with nowhere to go so shell sleep with him perverted is also about the only clear character trait he gets in the anime run sad
anime,not_removed,any male protagonist whose mantra is afraid of girls literally or otherwise freaking mayo chiki having the worst case of that literally any harem protagnist tenchi really started something horrible with assholes who can somehow reset things to status quo despite having reached at least second base with one of the love interests last episode
anime,not_removed,shuu from guilty crown
anime,not_removed,ygo zexal is actually a pretty decent show ruined by a the worst ygo protagonist yuma he grows a bit but man its such a chore getting to there its even worse if your dealing with him in english where they translated his signature phrase kattabingu da ore to stupid shit like im gonna jet or hifive the sky or feeling the flow
anime,not_removed,kodaka from haganai
anime,not_removed,im usually okay with harem leads with their ineptitude blandness and hype however sahashi minato from sekirei is one guy i just cant handle maybe its because of me reading in flight
anime,not_removed,the fat guy from accel world so fucking annoying barely gets anything done just whines about his problems whilst others protect him youd think hes snap and go psycho on his bullies but nope he keeps doing what they say
anime,not_removed,natsuki subaru from rezero mikazuki augus from gundam ibo entire tekkadumb from gundam ibo makoto ittou from school days
anime,not_removed,i really didnt like renton thurston in eureka seven
anime,not_removed,giovanna giorno hes even flatter than caesar zeppelli
anime,not_removed,itou makoto
anime,not_removed,makoto naegi hes a bland beta gary stu with zero personality
anime,not_removed,yuu from owari no seraph is fuckin dumb
anime,not_removed,i think im the worst protagonist from one room but in actual shows maybe kyousuke from oreimo kodaka from haganai or hikki from oregairu
anime,not_removed,koyomi araragi they dude is generic in every way other then his perversion
anime,not_removed,takeshi nanase from mahou sensou literally dumbest mc i have ever seen
anime,not_removed,obligatory answer shinji ikari edit woah settle down with the downvotes people i called it an obligatory answer because i knew somebody was going to post him eventually not that hes the only mc to deserve it whether or not you agree is up to you but dont use the downvote button as a disagree button
anime,not_removed,you should edit that to brownhaired protagonist syndrome because its more accurate
anime,not_removed,at least he becomes spoilers
anime,not_removed,not to mention how they handle his family problems
anime,not_removed,bullshit im going to need examples of poor writing ill agree he isnt very interesting other then his nut job girlfriend and the whole death game
anime,not_removed,hey now sometimes he also spouts random facts to remind us that hes the smart character
anime,not_removed,hey now i think thats unfair after all was inaho really even a character
anime,not_removed,i like to believe in the theory that he is fully aware of the feelings of girls around him but he acts dense because choosing one would create for him a pick one to protect you and the others try to kill you scenario
anime,not_removed,his density is both the best thing and worst thing about him
anime,not_removed,i thought it was supposed to be an underdog story about a kid discriminated for things he had no control over and trying to reach recognition by hard work not a this was destiny youre the chosen onetype of story this is one of the reasons why the franchise went downhill
anime,not_removed,unless it is a light novel title
anime,not_removed,fixed it
anime,not_removed,dont tell me what to do
anime,not_removed,i second this the moron cant even remember which element is weak to which and has to relearn it every season or sometimes in the middle of a season
anime,not_removed,can you give me an example of a beta male insert protagonist
anime,not_removed,read the light novels atleast progressive
anime,not_removed,he does become a badass by the end though
anime,not_removed,the worst thing is that the pokemon psyduck is called enton in german and everytime someone said his name i instantly had this retarded eeeeentoooon from the pokemon in my mind and even his character fits this retarded duck
anime,not_removed,but he has muda
anime,not_removed,agreed he just does unnecessary shit all the time that ends up backfiring on him and his team
anime,not_removed,i dont think people are downvoting as a disagree button but because it straightup doesnt apply you could argue that hes unlikable but worst implies that hes actually a bad protagonist and evangelion literally wouldnt work without shinji being the way he is so calling him a bad protagonist would require massively misunderstanding the show
anime,not_removed,wrong
anime,not_removed,whats so bad about shinji
anime,not_removed,whats wrong you dont like characters who are written like real people
anime,not_removed,hai
anime,not_removed,okay for instance s he forgives his father for killing his mother almost instantly and his fathers death causes him to have a complete character change that is incredibly unrealistic based on what he had done entirely up to that point s hes just killed a shitload of orphans because apparently this wimpy schoolkid is now an expert killer and his shitbag father dying was the reason he needed for this he has diary holders and directly in front of him he could easily kill them but all says to him is that yuno isnt actually yuno and he just gives up trying to kill them doesnt matter that he just killed all those orphans or that his father died now he loses motivation immediately this isnt even taking into the account that s he falls in love with someone who actively has tried to kill his family and friends has kidnapped him and stalked him and is literally crazy despite the fact that he was very against those things earlier on in the show hes a plot device character that they literally change not develop parts of the way through the series so that they can go into a new direction
anime,not_removed,my light novel title cant be this cute
anime,not_removed,my light novel title naming conventions are wrong as i expected
anime,not_removed,lol no worries man
anime,not_removed,this is ranime not rlightnovels
anime,not_removed,even the way that happens felt lame and forced to me but you are right
anime,not_removed,fair enough
anime,not_removed,he acts like a normal human being would act in those circumstances while some people would generally like an unrealistic badass that would slay angels with a passion and drop cool oneliners
anime,not_removed,none of those are bad writing just subtleties that you and many others seem to have missed s yukki is a broken emotionally stunted year old he has no friends and his parents are never around all he wants is someone that loves him his father did love him at least before he became a dead beat in massive debt by the time his father kills his mother yukkis world is a crazy fucked up place he just wants some normalcy back while yukkis motivations are naive that doesnt make it bad writing s yukki is playing the game in ernest at this point he believes the only way to return his fucked up reality to normal is to win at this point he is still writing down the names of all the people he kills so he can bring them back after he wins he still doesnt fully trust yuno when this revaluation comes around it stops him in his tracks its hard to listen to someone who might not be the person you thought they were s go ahead and google stockholm syndrome but thats just one part of this situation yuno loves yukki unconditionally just look at all she did to be with him as i stated before all yukki has wanted was love this is evidenced a few times in the show like when his father helps with his training or his happy family in third world which version did you watch sub or dub i feel like ive i watched a different show then half of ranime yukkis motivations always seemed apparent to me even if they were subtle or rather misguided
anime,not_removed,httpssaltysaltystudioscomshizlncoversphp
anime,not_removed,thats why alpha af harem protagonists should be cherished ie juicy yuuji arata from trinity seven etc
anime,not_removed,not really being put in situations of great danger while having someones expectations to live up to and people to protect can really change someone for the better i dont really feel like it was that forced besides it took a long time for him to become a hero
anime,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfckkzihquau is my goto recommendation for people who hated nge because of shinji
anime,not_removed,no harem protag is more alpha than that guy is a boarderline rapist he is so alpha he even beats up and molests queens blade characters in crossovers a total jerk actually
anime,not_removed,how do you think evangelion would have turned out if gainex stuck with the original idea and made asuka the protagonist
anime,not_removed,he is so alpha he even beats up and molests queens blade characters in crossovers and somehow i like him because of this
anime,not_removed,you clearly havent met rance
anime,not_removed,that probably wouldve worked out fine i think shinji is a little more interesting than asuka though part of that is because hes the protagonist
anime,not_removed,i feel like he could be worse than rance in the sense that he made his harem for fun and isnt even hentai protag
anime,not_removed,i wish there was some way we could see that eva version
anime,not_removed,i think we can all agree that we learned something important today and that is that vagina monsters are better than giant boobie monsters
anime,not_removed,httpiimgurcomptlngvqgifv httpiimgurcomaghjhsdgifv httpiimgurcomqjnrlvwgifv httpiimgurcomzqdcrtpgifv think i missed something let me know baby
anime,not_removed,excellent it deserves it that movie was ridiculously fun
anime,not_removed,give us season i am literally throwing money at my laptop screen right now just make it happen youve already setup the pro leagues and the world championship you cockteases fuck you could adapt little army or ribbon warrior if you wanted to i need my anime tank fix
anime,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomtameresponsibleelectriceel
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,now that ive watched the film i can totally see why its so successful because its fucking awesome
anime,not_removed,thats really impressive considering the tv series aired years before the first madoka movies were around a year earlier than rebellion
anime,not_removed,i should watch this show one of my coworkers is old enough that he should be thinking of retirement in the next years hes exmilitary loves tanks and is generally intolerant to most bs still ive seen him grin like a stupid idiot when talking about this show blew my mind the first time he admitted to watching anime this one was his favorite
anime,not_removed,they have to make a season i mean theres university for the ooarai girls or maybe the rabbit team could become the main team after miho and co graduate theres a damn world competition for senshado already watched the film twice it truly deserves its earnings and more with how great it is and the ova was like meeting with an old friend damn i missed all the tank action
anime,not_removed,its earnings are well deserved it was a blast to watch and the finns were amazing i want more of them and their music
anime,not_removed,moe for the win now i just need a tank

anime,not_removed,it has not surpassed the love live the school idol movie which is not surprising but also kind of sad der film was incomparably more amazing
anime,not_removed,congrats to gup for putting up so impressive scores the franchise certainly blossomed right before our eyes i dont think anyone saw that coming off a rather silly premise
anime,not_removed,its has anyone seen it how was it
anime,not_removed,theres still no announcement about a us blu ray release right id consider importing it but the japanese version only has japanese subtitles fyi some japanese releases do have english subtitles id really like to give some legitimate source my money
anime,not_removed,i still need to watch this movie but i can´t to watch it this was only release on theaters or we can see it already didn´t know gup was so well know around here and japan but congratulations for surpassing madoka movie
anime,not_removed,excellent it deserves it that movie was ridiculously fun tank drifting
anime,not_removed,they dont need to go with world championship yet all i want is national tournament in which oorai beats st gloriana
anime,not_removed,ribbon warrior will be pure animergasm
anime,not_removed,new best girl
anime,not_removed,it feels so weird when my tiny home country gets mentioned online let alone in anime
anime,not_removed,i like httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxaxmdfmmzqk
anime,not_removed,what i love about girls und panzer is that the tanks are the main focus of the show theres a grand total of like thirty seconds of bikini fanservice in the entire series and the rest is approximately tanks doing tank things pretty standard sliceoflife and tanks doing things that tanks probably shouldnt be doing the movie then takes those tank things and cranks them up to eleven
anime,not_removed,its a really fun show try it
anime,not_removed,because muse disbandment was more interesting more emotional than karl gerat the finnssarcasm intended
anime,not_removed,you can find it online since a few days ago
anime,not_removed,also tank flying
anime,not_removed,monotrack drifting
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,what no st glo is against ooarai splendid isolation ya cunts black tea green tea british landship supremacy cannot be defeated
anime,not_removed,isnt st gloriana british like i know they speak japanese but they look western
anime,not_removed,that sweet action
anime,not_removed,not to mention teh yuri will break scouters again coz it definitely goes over xd
anime,not_removed,finn girl is best girl
anime,not_removed,japan has a bit of a thing for us just see how big moomin is over there so i guess us being featured is a lot more likely than other random tiny foreign countries still weird though
anime,not_removed,man thats metal now imagine this playing during the tank battles
anime,not_removed,japan is just a much bigger fan of everything idolsrelated than literally any other genre
anime,not_removed,thanks bro excitedyui
anime,not_removed,and the finns
anime,not_removed,thats some httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpxgmeeoeiq right there
anime,not_removed,st glo is against ooarai thats why it will be sweetest victory in the series it will happen im tellin ya
anime,not_removed,isnt st gloriana british of course not all teams we saw are japanese and participated well with exception of university team duh in japans national high school tournament in theyre just themed after various nations and trying too hard to be like them
anime,not_removed,the waifu war begins
anime,not_removed,a personal dreamnightmare occurred in this movie where both mamiko noto and saori hayami were cast in it while i really like both va i have a terrible time distinguishing their voices thankfully they were never in the same scene
anime,not_removed,just yuri ship the two and you will have best girl²
anime,not_removed,you know whats even weirder than gup doing finns theres a manga about simo häyhä well except that he is a cute girl in it anyone not finnish reading is a famous finnish sniper often called the white death he fought in the winter war and got about kills in three months
anime,not_removed,in terms of wartime depictions of finland im guessing it could be a certain degree of relativity to the fact that both finland and japan fought against the soviet union as an isolated conflict ie a smaller country alone against a larger russian force
anime,not_removed,maybe robots excluded staff weve got idols bd staff weve got robots bd staff now even better weve got them both fans ewww
anime,not_removed,im glad new characters movie introduced are just as much of a best girls as the girls we saw in tv series they do not disappoint at all so yeah the finns theyre insane
anime,not_removed,so basically theyre teaboos
anime,not_removed,huh i wonder if the hair dye and contacts are provided by the schools
anime,not_removed,aside from the russian team considering some of them actually speak fluent russian im so confused
anime,not_removed,anyone not finnish reading simo häyhä is a famous finnish sniper often called the white death he fought in the winter war and got about kills in three months but the real question is in a holy grail war would he be assassin or archer
anime,not_removed,oh yeah ive read that its bizarre yet strangely endearing even includes a cute girl mannerheim if i remember right
anime,not_removed,theyre also japanese maybe except for klara shes probably from russia
anime,not_removed,he would be his own class sniper
anime,not_removed,most of the heroes can be summoned as a variety of classes so he could probably end up being either
anime,not_removed,salute not bad
anime,not_removed,ok its just really creepy roleplaying i see thanks for clearing that up
anime,not_removed,hoho haha
anime,not_removed,i know i was asking a preference queation
anime,not_removed,oreki from hyouka
anime,not_removed,shikamaru nara from naruto spent his days at the ninja academy sleeping watching the clouds or playing games of shōgi and go

anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,read or die maybe
anime,not_removed,post removed as the question has been answered
anime,not_removed,thanks it seemed pretty obscure wasnt sure i was gonna be able to find it again
anime,not_removed,yep
anime,not_removed,a couple you could start off with are snow white with the red hair sukitte ii na yosay i love you kimi ni todoke mashiroiro symphony the color of lovers starts off as a very generic looking harem but it transitions into romance working a underrated romance because it doesnt get billed as one but it very much is has season and a min final garden of words
anime,not_removed,if you want something a bit more serious then maybe you can try these all my personal favorites ef a tale of memoriesmelodies white album gosick nana
anime,not_removed,just quickly scrolled through my watched list akagami no shirayukihime amagami ss ss netoge no yome wa onnanoko ja nai to omotta ano natsu de matteru aura maryuuinkouga saigo no tatakai beyond the boundary and movies clannad clannad second season chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai chobits golden time itazura na kiss kimikiss pure rouge kimi ni todoke lovely complex my love story please teacher say i love you tasogare otome x amnesia the garden of words the pet girl of sakurasou tonari no kaibutsukun your lie in april some of these i suppose the romance isnt the primary focus but its very much present and ive tended to lean towards shows that have a conclusion rather than watching or episodes and being fucked in the ass and rather hard too when they leave it
anime,not_removed,spice and wolf
anime,not_removed,is a nice one d
anime,not_removed,well if you want something tonally similar to toradora golden time is by the same author ive never seen it but people say its pretty good some people even like it better my personal favorite romance is a lesserknown anime from called koi kaze is an excellent exploration of the raw strength and inexorable nature of love both in its capacity to heal hearts and destroy lives forcing down societal barriers and even our own consciences with no regard for human judgement a theme even showcased in the shows title which translates literally to love wind some viewers may find the subject matter off putting but i find that if they give it a chance they will find an engaging and ethically challenging love story centered around a pair of complex multidimensional characters who are contemptible as often as sympathetic
anime,not_removed,nana
anime,not_removed,what is your favorite romantic anime
anime,not_removed,kimi ni todoke
anime,not_removed,your lie in april and white album
anime,not_removed,my favourite is the i prefer it over toradora and golden time which i also enjoyed
anime,not_removed,his and her circumstances i dont tend to like the romance genre because so often the characters are stupid andor the way they interact is unreasonable but hahc does it right its also really funny and touching
anime,not_removed,spice and wolf but its also one of my biggest heartbreaks after you finish season and heres no more anime left
anime,not_removed,clannad and clannad after story is my favorite the pacing is really slow but the final episodes are amazing
anime,not_removed,romance is more of a subplot but i love bokura wa minna kawaisou for how much progress is made since they first met lovely complex and amagami ss are two of my favs which romance is the main plot point
anime,not_removed,i liked my little monster
anime,not_removed,in order maidsama kimi ni todoke sakura trick its romance no mysterious girlfriend x karin chibi vampire
anime,not_removed,and
anime,not_removed,i see lots of people suggesting golden time but personally i was let down by it after toradora and havent bothered to finish it at the same time i was watching lovely complex and i reckon thats a way better romancecomedy chuunibyou is great too one of my favourites
anime,not_removed,you still have the rest of my list from so im not going to drop that again
anime,not_removed,bokura ga ita 💔 romance slice of life
anime,not_removed,nagi no asukara centimeters per second planetes ef a tale of memoriesmelodies
anime,not_removed,mystrerious girlfriend x is fun
anime,not_removed,i havent watched a lot but my favorite so far is golden time because of how lighthearted it is your lie in april was good too im currently watching toradora i heard its from the same studio from golden time
anime,not_removed,never change banjo
anime,not_removed,banjo
anime,not_removed,this is what i hate about the clannad series for me the first season was dreadful and the first half of afterstory wasnt any better essentially you have to sit through or so episodes of bad to get to the ok
anime,not_removed,never change banjo
anime,not_removed,but how can you tell shes winking
anime,not_removed,but how can you tell shes winking one the intent you can clearly tell thats a wink and not a blink two the context i dont want to spoil the episode its the ova for the first season so you will have to go see for yourself three thats part of the joke rikka always wears her eyepatch on her other eye regardless of the situation meaning her other eye being in view has no bearing on the action its a wonderful little scene
anime,not_removed,monogatari

anime,not_removed,thanks is it any good
anime,not_removed,youd have to try it to see it is regarded as good but its really up to personal taste
anime,not_removed,ive seen about half of thesemainly galaxy expressgunbuster and the gundam ovas
anime,not_removed,thoughts where are did all the lums from the other universes go did every lum end up going to different universes or is was it just a coincidence that our lum never ran into a parallel version of herself the universe where ataru loses the game of tag because hes too distracted by lums boobs somehow seems like thats what should have actually happened girlmegane was terrifying boyryuunosuke was interesting i feel sorry for lum realizing shes in the wrong universe when ataru is being openly nice to her
anime,not_removed,where are did all the lums from the other universes go did every lum end up going to different universes or is was it just a coincidence that our lum never ran into a parallel version of herself she wouldnt have run into the others i feel sorry for lum realizing shes in the wrong universe when ataru is being openly nice to her more depressing that i think the episode intended to be
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,we have a bot to do that
anime,not_removed,i dont see whats so awkward about itwhy they responded awkwardly unless after you asked about haikyuu you said something like its a great animemy favorite sports animehype af yo after all since they know about it they shouldve interpreted your question as a meme
anime,not_removed,classic freudian slip
anime,not_removed,whats wrong with keijo it has a great plot
anime,not_removed,got a chuckle out of me
anime,not_removed,on the bright side op because the table went silent it means they know what keijo is and watched it maybe
anime,not_removed,relevant thing but not at all i fucking had a dream where the keijo people i only watched the first minutes of the sub before slamming down my laptop visited karasuno and the rest of it was me screaming in terror as hinata used his butt to spike nishinoya used his chest to receive and kageyama wore a swimsuit the worst experience
anime,not_removed,i also have a tifu related to keijo i have a fellow weeb friend that i text all the time when im watching shows and i sometimes send him pictures of things i find funny at the time i was watching keijo i saw that the next episodes title was boob hypnosis so i thought he would get a laugh out of it hes usually the only person i regularly text so i just loaded it in without a second thought and said episode titles on point what i didnt remember was that i was texting my mom earlier because she had just left on a flight i didnt even think of anything of it until she replied did you mean to send this to me at that moment i thought i had died yet i couldnt stop laughing at myself for that mistake to this day we have never directly discussed boob hypnosis but i have gotten some passive aggressive comments from her that seemed to stem from it
anime,not_removed,they are weeb enough to watch anime regularly why are they shocked when you mention keijo
anime,not_removed,the title misled me i thought it was going to be things that happened in anime where characters fucked up vegeta tifu by letting cell absorb android pride and spine seriously damaged ash tifu by recommending alain try out for the pokemon league and so on
anime,not_removed,hey op look at the bright side at least you can talk about anime in public
anime,not_removed,whats the difference i dont know japanese
anime,not_removed,on the bright side at least thats what got your sister to fall silent and not coming out right at least id hope so
anime,not_removed,i like it xd
anime,not_removed,id just finished telling them they should watch yuri on ice so was still in the you should check this out mode
anime,not_removed,all depends on the delivery
anime,not_removed,kill all the japanese lol
anime,not_removed,deleted
anime,not_removed,keijo is a serious sports anime
anime,not_removed,ranimeplot
anime,not_removed,someone should make this post now
anime,not_removed,is a volleyball anime with male teams is an anime about girls battling it out with their boobs and asses
anime,not_removed,completely different series one about a high school volleyball team the other about attractive high school girls in swimsuits sumo wrestling with their boobs and butts
anime,not_removed,haikyuu is a normal sports anime keijo is pure fanservice sports anime where busty girls battle with their butts
anime,not_removed,ah fair enough indeed awkward xd
anime,not_removed,it was just a prank bro sis
anime,not_removed,you know what would get in the way of this actually decent plan and get the plot moving along if i told you to do this exact thing that would ruin everything
anime,not_removed,the latter looked like a teenage boys wet firearm ive started watching haikyuu
anime,not_removed,oh christ thats embarrassing
anime,not_removed,except that the makers of keijo seemed sincere when they said in their eyes it was a serious sports anime i mean you cant deny it was full of tits and ass but they argue it was because the sport was built that way as opposed to it being pure fan service
anime,not_removed,one is fujobait the other is a sport anime fite me
anime,not_removed,got it thanks
anime,not_removed,i wouldnt say keijo is pure fan service yeah sure there is a decent amount but for the concept i expected much more
anime,not_removed,you should give keijo a try
anime,not_removed,from the move compilations i have seen keijo is a very fun show though
anime,not_removed,the sport was made that way to create fanservice its literally fanservice sumo
anime,not_removed,i will i challenge you to a keijo battle
anime,not_removed,ummm im not sure
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,and wrestling is basically fanservice invented by greeks so people could see oiled up muscled men duke it out
anime,not_removed,you really should
anime,not_removed,i followed your recommendation now my dick is stuck in a chipper
anime,not_removed,i cant watch the video but im assuming this is for the dub right
anime,not_removed,correct

anime,not_removed,but did your brain tremble while making this thats the most important part
anime,not_removed,trembling from all the love
anime,not_removed,excellent
anime,not_removed,a lot of ops seem to be made for the anime they dont just go and pick one thats already made to use usually
anime,not_removed,its a great market tactic fans of the band will go watchbuy the anime to hear the new op of the band they like fans of the anime will go buyattend concerts of the band that made a great op for their show new works sell more than old works
anime,not_removed,most anime used to pick an existing song back in the days like before but now it seems like most ops and eds are specifically made as the anime industry is more and more commercialized
anime,not_removed,i love the video op for angel beats just beautiful all around
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,gintamas op
anime,not_removed,httpsdmaxfilerooqzputqwgywebm was quite amusing
anime,not_removed,has really really pretty visuals they tell you a lot about the show
anime,not_removed,probably also not bad
anime,not_removed,i always liked the death parade dancing
anime,not_removed,nisekoi
anime,not_removed,yep still baccano tatami galaxy and haruhi even without music are good ops
anime,not_removed,probably subete ga f ni naru the perfect insider i dont even really like the show dropped it about halfway through but that opening was cool as fuck kemono no souja erins first op is really cool too
anime,not_removed,the customised opening for gintama
anime,not_removed,visually most jojo ops are pretty good especially httpsmymixtapemoeyplbktwebm and httpsdmaxfileroqhrpsxwuvgwebm all the foreshadowing than can be seen by manga readers is pretty cool
anime,not_removed,gits gig
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,the half of nagi no asukara
anime,not_removed,baccano is fantastic with the way the op is directed and how it helps you remember characters names durarara mimicked this but it wasnt quite as good still love it though
anime,not_removed,based ohira
anime,not_removed,is always the answer here
anime,not_removed,i agree
anime,not_removed,i tought the first opening was way better than the second one
anime,not_removed,i honestly regret watching it all the way through what a waste of my thursdays
anime,not_removed,cant wait for the new jojo op soon
anime,not_removed,i heard it went full retard after the s dream realitiy vision tank things which is right around where i dropped the show
anime,not_removed,s it really did the reveal of the killer was terrible and the motives were even worse the entire final episode was just pointless exposition that nobody cared about im getting triggered just thinking about it
anime,not_removed,i dont know what universe youre from where episodes is doable in one day
anime,not_removed,i like how you could have made a list of really solid ovas like trust and betrayal war in the pocket or gunbuster and instead filled with list with episode shows hell even shows under episodes like ping pong or kyousougiga would have fit in better than something like blood
anime,not_removed,do it at speed and it takes you almost hours not really doable do it at speed and it takes you almost hours more reasonable time if you eat breakfast and dinner while watching anime and do other bodily functions during oped do it at speed and it takes you a bit more than hours
anime,not_removed,the otaku one p episodes minutes each skip intro and ending makes shorter but well count entire episode comes out to nearly hours watch time and a day is hours so yeah
anime,not_removed,yeah or episodes is my limit ive finished a episode season maybe times and only finished a episode season in one day once in my life
anime,not_removed,lol this guy has the right idea
anime,not_removed,i have been watching a show a day from winter season before spring and only made it halfway through the seasons i do it at the speed so yeah episodes a day at is totally doable after a while you will not even notice
anime,not_removed,code geass season i started it on a saturday mourning at like and i dont think i stopped watching all day besides to go to the bathroom or grab a drink
anime,not_removed,after a while you will not even notice after a while youll realize its an awful way to view things like i thought you were joking but if you actually do this youre missing out on so much of a series voice acting and music are pitch altered so throw that out the window youre missing comedic timing of its a comedy anime youre missing the emotion some scenes have youre missing the sweet moments the sad the happy literally all of it if youre watching a sped up version of something you havent even watched it you just know what happens
anime,not_removed,ok
anime,not_removed,just bored
anime,not_removed,yay shampoo wait chi chi is chinese
anime,not_removed,needs more meiling li from ccs
anime,not_removed,i dont think eva ushiromiya is chinese
anime,not_removed,is technically taiwanese does she count edit there she is tied for
anime,not_removed,well there may be no china in dragon ball but shes still very chinese by character qipao dress hair bun strong emphasis on childrens education exceptionally good at martial arts distinct accent etc even her favorite food is chinese chimaki according to supplementary material
anime,not_removed,maybe not officially considering the strange geography of dragon balls earth but she certainly has chinese features considering her chinesestyle fashion
anime,not_removed,space thunder kids long shot but there are quite a few old korean shows that were released here back in the day
anime,not_removed,no doesnt look like it thanks though to add on i dont think there were any people in the show it was all fully sentient robots kind of like transformers they also kinda looked like gundams but had no pilots or anything
anime,not_removed,mfw no yamada as manager harunaehhh
anime,not_removed,seems fun i loved the original working because every single character was fun to watch and the constant interactions with everyone just made it even more entertaining hopefully this is more of the same formula but with different characters
anime,not_removed,its a different show but its worth it help me out guys someone
anime,not_removed,wagnaria without yamada hmm
anime,not_removed,my god they are talking so fast
anime,not_removed,i dont know how but i already hate kisaki maybe its the hair
anime,not_removed,sois crunchyroll picking up the simulcast or not considering they have working and servant x service i assume they are but considering the first episode premieres on the theyre cutting it pretty close
anime,not_removed,thatt tomorrow
anime,not_removed,anyone knows what the duration of the show is i cant help but feel that its going to be a short episode format for some reason
anime,not_removed,wow this is a weird first for me im actually in japan right now and looks like the uploader didnt allow it in this country took me a sec to remember i went to japan lol im thinking that nobody is gonna have a mirror
anime,not_removed,im calling it now sayuri muranushi will be best girl of this show
anime,not_removed,id be exausted too if i had to talk that fast
anime,not_removed,yamada needs a cameo
anime,not_removed,souma was easily my favorite character in the previous show cant wait for this one
anime,not_removed,servant x service by the same mangaka was basically that in an office instead of a restaurant workcom with a bunch of weird people seems to just be her thing so i fully expect wwwworking to be good in a similar way
anime,not_removed,some one
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,if its like the original working series or servant x service itll just be a normal minute long episode
anime,not_removed,usual minutes like the original working
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,someone else
anime,not_removed,comment timestamp article timestamp i guess i can read mr lusters mind
anime,not_removed,oh i forgot about youpak thanks
anime,not_removed,one one
anime,not_removed,hellsing ultimate
anime,not_removed,claymore i think the graphics are partly outdated compared to the shows coming out now but its still a pretty good series except the ending ending was quite shite
anime,not_removed,what you need are ovas not just mindless killing just for the sake of it nevermind
anime,not_removed,basilisk or shigurui are both brutal with tons of gore
anime,not_removed,psycho pass season one sounds like a good option for this though id also recommend hellsing ultimate
anime,not_removed,beserk elfen lied
anime,not_removed,drifters
anime,not_removed,black lagoon
anime,not_removed,although gintama is comedy their action is pretty bloody
anime,not_removed,deadman wonderland
anime,not_removed,gantz
anime,not_removed,akira nuff said
anime,not_removed,yep not trying to push the manga but the ending is alittle bit better
anime,not_removed,he said he wanted it to be good
anime,not_removed,some of the attempts to use slang in the durarara dub have always been odd dont jack with the cops
anime,not_removed,yeah the durarara dub isiffy to say the least
anime,not_removed,well deserved
anime,not_removed,i need this so i can proudly display my weeabooness through that pink box case
anime,not_removed,it was a nice show with some fun interactions came for hotaru stayed for saya tho
anime,not_removed,i didnt think it was anything special it was fun to watch some of the comedy was great some of it wasnt character designs and voices were pretty good i liked it
anime,not_removed,it was an amusing little comedy but ultimately it was meh at best
anime,not_removed,hotaru is the best i didnt hate dagashi but i didnt really like it after six episodes i dropped it because even though i liked the characters the jokes werent funny also i had enough info to wank to all those hotaru doujins
anime,not_removed,great nostalgia trip
anime,not_removed,it relies pretty heavily on your knowledge of japanese candies so i had no idea what the hell they were so worked up about half the time so its a meh for me
anime,not_removed,it starts off really strong and it looks like the plot will actually advance but it never does after the first episode or two it essentially just becomes a fancy commercial for various kinds of candy
anime,not_removed,i thought it was pretty funny the first episodes and then it got pretty meh i still finished it but it lost something after a while
anime,not_removed,it could have been a great concept as a seinen iyashikei title but it was sadly dragged down by all of the shounenstandard tropes
anime,not_removed,i dropped it after episodes did not enjoy it and found it very boring
anime,not_removed,disappointed because if the manga ever shifts in the romance direction then that aside it was alright it might have been somewhat better if i knew anything about japanese sweets
anime,not_removed,it starts out really slow but once sayo comes in the double entendres keep on coming and sayo is the perfect butt of many jokes
anime,not_removed,i found it really boring tbh i was really hyped before the season started but i ended up dropping it at episode saya was best girl but hotaru is still hot as fuck
anime,not_removed,i really enjoyed it got me into slice of life
anime,not_removed,put at the end below a paragraph will make big bold letters put a space line between the line and the paragraph that said its pretty enjoyable but many wont like it because the topic of japanexclusive candies is not appealing
anime,not_removed,one of only two shows where the flatchested girl was best
anime,not_removed,this show is really cultural sensitive you either get hit by nostalgia or just get confused as to why other people are hit by nostalgia
anime,not_removed,i have a dream that one day these videos will no longer be made
anime,not_removed,youre friend either lied or he himself hasnt watched the version unless hes talking about the movie then forgive me the fate series is an adaptation of a visual novel which has three different routes the one adapts the original route but then attempts to amalgamate the other two routes it fails at it miserably the ubw anime that came out not long ago is a sole adaptation of the second route fatezero is a prequel storywise to the entire game and so naturally spoils all the revelations if youre enjoying the fsn then might as well finish it youre not losing anything youll be spoiled but youll be spoiled when you watch fzero anyway unless you want to wait until like to watch it so how i would recommend your experience with the franchise fsn ubw seasons fzero heavens feel movie trilogy
anime,not_removed,if you are enjoying it then its worth watching then you can wach fatezero and uwb after if you crave for more
anime,not_removed,well youre already a third of the way in i would just finish it at this point then move onto the ufotable series you can skip deens ubw movie
anime,not_removed,its not a better version ubw is a different route while version combined multiple route in a single show
anime,not_removed,i havent played the vn so i cant say my opinion of fatesn is based on how it deviates from the source material i personally enjoyed it as its own show but if youre going to watch the series i recommend going in airing order of fatesn fatezero fate sn ubw heavens feel which has yet to come out coming out in i think sn and zero complemented each other very very well and ubw was more enjoyable to watch because i had more information on the series as a whole its how it aired and i think thats how it should be seen
anime,not_removed,if you are actually enjoying it then sure just keep watching it i will however recommend to skip the part with caster somewhere around episode where sakura is abducted if you do follow my recommendation then you just need to know s caster dies assassin dies gilgamesh appear and sakura is saved i recommend this to avoid the spoilers they have for the other two routes and it doesnt really make sense what happens
anime,not_removed,if you dont plan on reading the visual novel watch ubw and fatezero instead
anime,not_removed,i agree with your friend that you should skip

anime,not_removed,not all main characters kon had yui sick chuunibyou ren had rikka sick tamayura had maon sick all of them lived to see their series end
anime,not_removed,s damn you key damn you you always betray me this is what im saying in my head towards the end of some of the big key adaptations
anime,not_removed,i mean s love interest doesnt die per se
anime,not_removed,i just dont like it when animes throw a death out of left field everythings fine and dandy and then fuck this persons dead and now everyones sad but they somehow learn a lesson
anime,not_removed,if someone in kon had died i wouldve killed myself
anime,not_removed,i dont think op meant anime where a character gets sick for a single episode but rather anime where a characters defining characteristic is httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainillgirl tvtropes
anime,not_removed,yeah but if the character is sick you can be certain that they are going to die especially if they are the mcs love interest

anime,not_removed,if someone in kon had died it might have actually been enjoyable to watch
anime,not_removed,thatd make more sense thanks
anime,not_removed,if you go in expecting to dislike a thing youre probably gonna wind up finding reasons to dislike it if youve already tried a decent range of genres odds are they just dont want to get into it in the first place which is fine best let it go
anime,not_removed,why are you trying to make them like it
anime,not_removed,start bold and brave throw them in the deep end with keijo
anime,not_removed,at times like this i remember how lucky and fortunate i was i got into anime because of my parents my dad bought princess mononoke for my sister and i he got us into ghibli movies they introduced me to naruto bleach and one piece when they bought the shonen jump anthologies for us he even brought us to our first anime convention he helped us with our first cosplay and even cosplayed alongside us he was porco rosso sorry wasnt trying to rub it in your face just feeling nostalgic
anime,not_removed,it depends on what they like this is always the advice i give people who want to get others into anime find shows that match their taste if they like romance look for romance if they like scifi look for scifi i also recommend introducing them to movies first theyre shorter and easier to consume concisely try and get them to watch a couple of those before you really get them invested in a full series
anime,not_removed,mononoke hime isnt exactly a family film and it does tend to drag on i can see why they wouldnt like it ive had more success with movies like and
anime,not_removed,if it is adults you could try garden of words it does have a dub there is also nodame cantabile that has first two seasons dubedsub is better though of course this all depends what they into regularly if they into the superherosupernaturalsci fi live action shows and or low end comedy shows then they probably wouldnt like them
anime,not_removed,idk your familys tastes so i cant recommend anything maybe update the thread to include what they like
anime,not_removed,really though how could someone not like it one approach could be to ask them what it is that they dont like about the medium it sounds like you gave them an easier anime to try out but maybe there are other factors involved that are putting them off the style of animation the topics being considered the realistic foreign feel when compared to westernized cartoons try talking with them about anime itself and see why it is that they have reservations going in it may simply be that its not for them and thats aokay some stuff just doesnt appeal to others regardless of what happens i hope it works out well
anime,not_removed,try death note one punch man
anime,not_removed,some people just dont like it ask them why they dont like it and either work around it or if the answer is something akin to anime is for little babies go get a job just give up
anime,not_removed,have you tried ponyo
anime,not_removed,kiss x sis also kon is a winner
anime,not_removed,true
anime,not_removed,im not trying to make them i asked if theyd like to try it and they agreed
anime,not_removed,thats awesome my first experience with anything even slightly anime related was kingdom hearts not really anime but has anime influences my mom nearly through it out because she thought the art looked evil haha
anime,not_removed,i went with mononoke hime as my family tends to enjoy longer fantasy movies i think it just had to little action
anime,not_removed,true i chose it due to it being similar to theyre type of movies well that and its the only anime i have on dvd lol
anime,not_removed,ill check em out thanks
anime,not_removed,honestly my parents only watch shows usually westerns mostly however my mom adores epic fantasy mainly lotr my siblings mostly just like lowest common denominator stuff like minecraft trolling videos and such lol
anime,not_removed,nope i might give it a go thanks
anime,not_removed,then maybe its just not for them
anime,not_removed,watch something like erased feel like each episode forces you to watch the next one
anime,not_removed,then he goes on to call it a cartoon lol bill burr is a legend and this just makes me like him more
anime,not_removed,its one of the shows i look forward to the most right now its got sweet mech fights and the sol moments are a lot of fun too
anime,not_removed,im still watching it tbh its a bit meh but watchable
anime,not_removed,started watching this so far really liking it
anime,not_removed,i enjoy itive barely watched any anime in the past few years the rare or really great and different show here and there maybe but this one is really interesting i enjoy the man out of time dynamic and the action is good the story is pretty interesting and doesnt give too much away definitely give it a shot at least
anime,not_removed,one of my favorites from spring its a fun anime with likable cast i highly recommend it and its on netflix
anime,not_removed,it executes in a satisfactory way it doesnt have anything incredibly god awful about it but it doesnt really have anything that makes it go kaboom if you get that i guess heroine starts off annoying but it appears her character will grow as this series progresses and im a fan of the fighting in the show if i had to give a weakness the shows environment alternates between a sol schools and a military mech fighting one for a while it isnt hurting the show but it isnt helping it either id say to give it the episode rule if you like it by then youre going to continue enjoying it
anime,not_removed,a good fun show like mentioned in some of the other comments its split between action and slice of life i feel like they do a good job letting us see into the daily lives and personal interactions between the characters its worth it to at least give it a shot

anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,not exactly what youre looking for but psychological thriller mystery
anime,not_removed,ghost in the shellsac paranoia agent psychopass gunslinger girl higurashi
anime,not_removed,since most related things have been posted already ill suggest a bit of an outlier in kara no kyoukai its seinen as fuck too
anime,not_removed,psycho pass full stop its exactly what you want danganronpa is my next recommendation youll probably like death note erased is a fun ride ive just started durararararara and it looks like its gonna have detective elements but i cant really confirm anything
anime,not_removed,giraffe blues is sooooooo good especially you can hear just the music
anime,not_removed,im in a tranquil with bokura no senjou
anime,not_removed,if you really like the songs buy them this doesnt help
anime,not_removed,album version of ikenai borderline isnt as good imho because the vocalist change partway through just feels wrong mikumo doing the whole song is best maybe i need to listen to it more but i went back to the singles version really love having frejya singer doing the first verse of giraffe blues then the second singer is so powerful and the ending
anime,not_removed,bless you sir
anime,not_removed,i just listened to the full version its amazing it has frejyas solo and then the group version also nice
anime,not_removed,i dunno maybe im weird but i prefer it with the ambiance
anime,not_removed,i love the full version but i prefer the version which freyja sings alone
anime,not_removed,i have their album walkure attack preordered on amiami
anime,not_removed,you prefer it with the machine gun sounds
anime,not_removed,yep really sets the mood dont forget the battle cries and dialogue
anime,not_removed,me too

anime,not_removed,thanks havent finished the series yet
anime,not_removed,ow sorry
anime,not_removed,clannad and clannad after story and its not even close
anime,not_removed,hunter x hunter was a blast wouldnt mind experiencing it again for the first time
anime,not_removed,fmab the reason i would love to rewatch it is because it didnt enjoy it that much i think the reason for this was because i got into the anime expecting the best thing that mankind has ever created with those expectations its bound to fail so i would like another chance with not so much hype behind it
anime,not_removed,hunter x hunter by far
anime,not_removed,shin sekai yori its one of my favourite anime and id love to be able to forget all the twists and go through them blind again
anime,not_removed,one piece
anime,not_removed,haruhi definitely haruhi being able to do that for the first time again would be pretty amazing
anime,not_removed,gintama for me though if i could pick both fullmetal alchemist series id go with that id love to watch brotherhood blind after having seen the version first
anime,not_removed,gurren lagann
anime,not_removed,cowboy bebopmy fifth favorite anime so i could experience my favorite scene in anime that happens during the last episode without any spoilers beforehand of what would happenbecause i was spoiled in some good detail about what would happen and how good it would fucking be now that i know nothing about it
anime,not_removed,i would have to go with nana watching it for the first time was amazing but it also is a series that for some reason is really hard to rewatch
anime,not_removed,welcome to the nhk i watched it once when i was younger and it was meh i watched it again after i graduated during the time i was looking for a job being at home all day for months in a depression where you feel worthless from going to interviews but never getting the job and post college when you start losing touch with friends really changed my perspective on the show if i could id like to forget the show so i didnt know anything about it and rewatch it now or have the second time i watched it been my first i really do like the show now but i think the impact would have been much greater if i didnt watch it before i could really connect with the cast
anime,not_removed,spice and wolf oregairu anohana
anime,not_removed,all the sexual assault in sword art online but then now that im older and smarter i would just drop it after the first two episodes
anime,not_removed,yeah i was a little bit spoiled before as because i went on youtube to find the nagisa song i love that song so i wanted to listen to it while cycling but then in the top search results or a recommended section there was a video with a certain spoiler regarding nagisa
anime,not_removed,i agree with after story id like to be able to leave a note for myself that says suck it up through season one the second half gets better and the season payoff is worth it dont read anything online just trust me when i tell you that everyone hates fuko also dango dango dango dango dango daikazoku
anime,not_removed,that one did turn into a thrill ride by the end excellent worldbuilding too
anime,not_removed,this doesnt metter the amount of episodes i would redo the one piece journey again
anime,not_removed,nothing even comes close
anime,not_removed,actually its a starfish i would also leave wooden starfishes in my room just to mess with future me seeing fuko wondering what the starfishes are about and finding out about the memory loss thing would make for a hilarious gag on someone who has memory loss related to a show
anime,not_removed,there is maybe someone who could help help me summon if its a toaru post he is sure to come
anime,not_removed,its been a while since ive read the novels so my memory is a bit fuzzy but ill do my best also keep in mind that this is of course a fictional series so the powers dont actually make sense despite kamachis love for pseudoscientific explanations s essentially all supernatural powers in the toaru series work through a concept best described as layers of reality you have the base reality which is the world in its base form magic and esper abilities apply layers to this reality effectively changing it to something else the imagine breaker functions by peeling those layers off and returning the reality to the state before that alteration the more powerful the ability the thicker and more strongly attached the layer and the harder it is for the imagine breaker to peel it off thats not really what youre asking but i thought it would be good to include s now the toaru series lore pulls a lot of inspiration from the works of the real aleister crowley and thelema his religion it deals a lot with the idea of imposing your egowill onto reality to effectuate a desire looking into the works of aleister crowley will shed a lot of light on kamachis plan for the series universe and lore s as for the pseudoscience elements a la your mention of the heisenberg uncertainty principle my memory isnt the best but heres what i remember esper abilities have to do with the idea of schrodingers cat everyone knows the thought experiment you have a cat in a box with something that might kill it but also might not the psifunction of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and dead cat mixed or smeared out in equal parts essentially it would show that the cat exists in two states simultaneously now in reality the thought experiment was designed to show how the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics becomes ludicrous when applied to everyday objects however in the toaru series lore this thought experiment partially explains some of the mechanics behind esper abilities s in the series lore esper abilities take an aspect of reality and turn it into a schrodingers cat the esper changes the state of the aspect to whatever state he or she desires it to be what that aspect is is decided by that espers personal reality how personal realities are determined is unknown at least to me as i am novels behind atm but it likely has something to do with personality and brain structure as weve seen esper abilities be partially duplicated through personalitybrain altering experiments like the dark may project s how espers brains actually do this is never really explained because well its just not possible but we have seen esper abilities used by machines even up to the potential of level with the rensa androidcyborgwhatever she was even being able to duplicate accelerators black wings thats all i really remember off the top of my head i hope that helped let me know if you have any questions and ill do my best to answer them if anyone with the series more fresh in their head has any corrections please speak up
anime,not_removed,there is no true scientific explanation everything ultimately derives from magic s basically you have this guy names alistair crowley who is the final bossmastermind behind everything that goes on in the toaru series he was a genius magician who at one point became so powerful that he could warp reality at will hes essentially god and he used his powers to create the entire concept of a science side to begin with the reasoning is complicated but it basically amounts giving the biggest fuck you ever to his fellow magicians for being the assholes that magicians tend to be so ultimately all science side abilities derive from one big magic spell with rules set down by one guy
anime,not_removed,i also noticed that some scenes in railgun and magical index are much different especially the fight between accelerator and touma
anime,not_removed,ohh dont forget uthesublimerone
anime,not_removed,ill do my best but its going to be a hell of a comment
anime,not_removed,actually not toaru because he is a unknown but esper powers like railgun and accelerator edit thought you said touma as in the character then proceeded to call it toaru myself
anime,not_removed,s it was described by uiharu that its like a delusion but then again most of the people with powers were very intelligent in there own ways so i always thought that line confused me does that mean then if you so desire it you can change your esper ability edit for some reason i cant spoiler tag for my life
anime,not_removed,oh wow i knew that guy was powerful but i didnt know any of that looks like the animes never give you the best story
anime,not_removed,hes banned on here
anime,not_removed,hey the better explained the less i have to fill in the gaps and hurt my head
anime,not_removed,the wise one has arrived
anime,not_removed,toaru or to aru or raildex is the short name of the series to aru means a certain in japanese
anime,not_removed,you might be confusing toaru with touma
anime,not_removed,toaru is the name of the series
anime,not_removed,when did she say that keep in mind that of the railgun anime is noncanon filler s the parameter list proves that potential is set in stone if an espers max potential is level they will never go beyond level regardless of how much effort they put in i think its fair to assume that the ability itself can never fundamentally change it may be able to evolve as more and more states of the aspect become accessible to the esper uiharus thermal hand could be a more versatile temperature manipulation power at a higher level but i do not think esper abilities can be fundamentally changed at least not without using an esper ability to make that change takitsubous aim stalker appears to be able to influence personal realities as well as aim diffusion fields at level she may be able to take and give esper abilities
anime,not_removed,what really edit its not like that im happy that he is gone
anime,not_removed,i was i rectified it
anime,not_removed,ohh sorry i though it said touma hahahaha as in the character
anime,not_removed,s where saten is sent to the private tutoring lessons after she uses the level upper along with other students
anime,not_removed,yup and im pretty close myself
anime,not_removed,yeah thats not in the manga it might be in a certain vending machines proof of existence which is an epilogue to that arc but i dont think that was out when the anime was made im also not sure if that dialogue is ever found elseqhere jc staff loves to give characters different characters lines for example everything vaguely plot related harue does in the sisters arc was taken from a different character typically at that characters expense i think it could be described as a delusion though you are deluding yourself that a certain aspect of reality is different and in turn changing that aspect of reality to match your delusion
anime,not_removed,how do you know im sorry
anime,not_removed,i bit like railgunmikasa has convinced herself that she can manipulate electric currents s through the various mind altering experiments they put kids through at the young age and therefore she now actually can manipulate current
anime,not_removed,the mods have made it very clear and are holding very petty infractions against me my favorite infraction is with the reason of being a douche despite that being one of the most nonhostile comments youll find on this subreddit last time i checked being a douche isnt against any rule here stay away from the mods if they set their eyes on you they wont rest until they get rid of you
anime,not_removed,you shouldve seen my face when i read your comment well i havent had any complaints about the mods here only ones ive seen are urban and missy and theyre both great sucks that this is happening to you you are very nice and helpful every time i see you comment
anime,not_removed,so they want to ban your for saying you think index should be watched first
anime,not_removed,wow thats really unfortunate and crappy a bit of a coincidence how you were talking about to aru then and now your on a whole post about it linking to that specific post that got you on the bad side of the mods
anime,not_removed,no a few of them want to ban me because they dont like me
anime,not_removed,just wanted to chime in here and say that the dub was absolutely outstanding in case anyone reads this and has yet to watch it everyone pretty much nails their role but niosi as reigen and mccarley as mob are especially good for their material
anime,not_removed,from what little ive seen i can already tell this is one of the best dubs of
anime,not_removed,also if you want to know in which episodes a character would die just ask them what will be there last episode on that show
anime,not_removed,wait a minute since when does kirbopher do dub work i remember when he used to do shit on newgrounds
anime,not_removed,so the dub is actually good to watch unlike most other dubs edit im not saying i dont like dubs or others suck just curious as to peoples opinion on how it compares i generally like dubs more than japanese as its in my native language
anime,not_removed,i think this is his first time
anime,not_removed,this stigma towards dubs is quite silly at this point is one of my recent favorites but dubs in general are solid most of the time other recent anime dubs i watched were boku no hero academia and saiki kusuo and both were great with the exception of saikis mom in the last third of the anime
anime,not_removed,hes been in pokemon at least i think
anime,not_removed,for sure i love good dubs and they are much more commonplace then they were in the late early the va pool has also gotten noticably larger so its not always the same actors in every show that being said no matter how good dubs will get i think there will always be an irrational hatred toward them from the western otaku community an actor could nail every part of the characters personality but just because they dont sound exactly like the original its a bad dub even if the acting is perfect people will find some way to tear into it saying the translation job was too liberal or they didnt match some obscure pun literally even though it would make no sense in english one dub that i have been very impressed with lately is akibas trip i think even among the hardcore anime community that show is kinda out there especially since its a videogame adaptation so im amazed how welldone the dub is in that show because itll probably never recogized for anything despite being better than a majority of dubs
anime,not_removed,huh neat to know then
anime,not_removed,i feel like i need to shout out to ping pong the animation for having a fantastic dub its truly amazing i dont think the sub can compete given how well they did the chinese accent and the old ladys constant love ya kid that just wouldnt come through for most sub viewers i certainly cant discern accent or dialect in japanese only general emotion and the occasional words or clichés but its so well acted im sure i missed nothing in the dub
anime,not_removed,not superlong but ive been doin things in vo for a while httpchrisniosicomvoiceoverresume
anime,not_removed,guess i misremembered i will say i like your work in mob psycho
anime,not_removed,however shinji seems to be talked about as a whiny sort of protagonist and i tend to be annoyed a lot by those mcs if you can stand sufferu in rezero heck you even gave it then i dont see how could you have any problems with shinji at all
anime,not_removed,you should dont worry about if you like it or not its just one of the shows that everyone should have an opinion on because itll always be relevant
anime,not_removed,yes even though im not the biggest fan of it the series has had one of if not the biggest impact on the anime industry and a piece of anime history that still holds up inspiring many future creators and at the time legitimately saved anime during rough financial situation for the whole industry also still widely discussed to this day i will warn you that it is polarizing where you will likely either love it or hate it but its best to experience it for yourself as for your question regarding shinji i hate sorata from sakurasou but i think shinji is a lot better of a character he is whiny but for good reason
anime,not_removed,shinji okabe and subaru are some of my favorite mcs
anime,not_removed,just watch the first episodes imo thats pretty much when shinji is at his whiniest and is when hes the least justified for it at the very least the dominating personality that shinji displays when hes at school is amiable enough for me to be on friendly terms with if i was an unimportant side character
anime,not_removed,yes like it or not its a classic that shaped the industry if you want to give opinions about shows that followed the genre you should watch it besides that personally i think it was fantastic shinji can eat a spiked dildo tho
anime,not_removed,ah makes sense d thanks
anime,not_removed,shinji stayed a fukboi bitch all the way through sufferu didnt he also didnt have sperm hand syndrome
anime,not_removed,i should probably start watching code geass then xd
anime,not_removed,thats nice to know d if shinji isnt like sorata i should probably be fine thanks
anime,not_removed,interesting perspective to take will keep in mind y thanks
anime,not_removed,already seeing polarised opinions on shinji here xd long as he doesnt end up as annoying as sorata i guess thanks
anime,not_removed,shinji stayed a fukboi bitch all the way through sufferu didnt shinjis developments are more realistic because shinji only has one life to fuck with he doesnt get a chance to undo every single time he fucks up something he has to live with actual consequences meanwhile in sufferus shoe dude literally cannot die he always has the chance to be brave and man up even if chances are slim
anime,not_removed,pretty sure subaru had that syndrome too only they didnt show it ԅ≖‿≖ԅ with rem being there and all
anime,not_removed,let me explain his character and writing make perfect sense there was nothing wrong or inconsistent with how they explain his background upbringing personality etc and i fucking cant stand the cunt regardless some people sympathize some dont you should watch it its good shit shinji does not make it a bad anime he makes it well he contributes it to being a polarizing anime
anime,not_removed,sounds like a personal fantasy
anime,not_removed,interesting opinion its beginning to sound like a feature shinji being annoying or not annoying
anime,not_removed,shrug
anime,not_removed,shinji being annoying or not annoying thats one of the things that always troubles me about reviews of this show shinji is the mc yeah but the primary side characters the story line the writing the music just everything really are all top notch shinji isnt the show he is of course a huge part of it but there is so much else there to take in as epic anime and this goes for haters and lovers and indifferents of shinji
anime,not_removed,please before taking it down because it isnt anime related think that the song comes from the anime and so do the characters
anime,not_removed,its that one its honestly one of the best ive ever watched better than erased and rezero imo no doubt itll be a cult classic in years to come
anime,not_removed,yes
anime,not_removed,yes it is it is really amazing i thought i wouldnt be into it but it was hard to put down truly a wonderful story
anime,not_removed,it is
anime,not_removed,thank you
anime,not_removed,unfortunately i dont live in the socal area but i am so fucking jealous right now i just looked at the guest list for ax and its god tier row upon row of people id love to meet have fun op and you may want to contact people in
anime,not_removed,wish i could sounds like a lot of fun
anime,not_removed,working ax now
anime,not_removed,thanks for the tip and hopefully one day youll have the pleasure of attending
anime,not_removed,credit for background art and art direction goes to
anime,not_removed,sadly i believe they will be replaced by inspiredjp who made the futuristic city of episode
anime,not_removed,flip flappers is the best anime this season art and animation wise imo
anime,not_removed,the studio behind their creation studio pablo my personal favorites were the scenes
anime,not_removed,oh that looks okay i guess next pretty cool next alright next next next next next next creepy anime grill faces
anime,not_removed,the less scifi stuff seriously looks like ghibli art which is really impressive especially for a tv anime
anime,not_removed,i fuckin love httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmgkjpdbnae cant hear it enough it just puts me in a really good mood
anime,not_removed,flip flappers is definitely one of the most gorgeous shows ive seen in a while its my mission in life to get some of these backgrounds in wallpaper size
anime,not_removed,flip flappers is going from that neat little artsy anime to surprise hit of the season so much to love about this show
anime,not_removed,i love how the first few look so normal and it slowly descents into madness
anime,not_removed,well youve sold me on starting to watch this show absolutely gorgeous work
anime,not_removed,httpimgurcomacwbrh dont forget this one
anime,not_removed,well best background art since httpiimgurcomegppknepng imo
anime,not_removed,i feel bad for anyone who draws those backgrounds for something that takes probably hours to draw its only ever shown for like a few seconds and then its never seen again
anime,not_removed,everything about this show has been seriously put through the ringer for craftsmanship the background art character designs dialouge plot everything its really exciting to see how its actually turned out to be one of the better shows this season from having the weirdest and most difficult to follow plot in the first few eps its cool cause everythings there you just need to really really look to see and understand it
anime,not_removed,what impress me in that is when its all hand draw you cant reuse much of the scenes after while if done in you basically build what the camera will see and can reuse that later on in fact you can do the full city then you dont have to redraw anything anymore also hand draw stuff require better skills than one heck there may be some building generator out there where you can easilly change the parameters and it generate a basic building which may be fine for most shots
anime,not_removed,rbackgroundart
anime,not_removed,yep and every pure illusion is unique give off a great sense of adventure
anime,not_removed,as someone who watched a couple of episodes and put the show on hold in order to watch it all when its complete hnng
anime,not_removed,these are indeed some bombastic looking backgrounds i am always amazed when i find myself taking screenshots of anime scenes to use as potential desktop backgrounds to have multiple frames of artworthy material is quite the accomplishment shows like this one aria space battleship yamato and others really make me enjoy anime
anime,not_removed,that classic hand painted look will never get old
anime,not_removed,the home city of cocona has a strong humanity has declined vibe in that it juxtaposes the blunt but never overstated state of ruin with bright colors to create a sense of unease as the audience awaits the reveal of what story elements led to such ruin and what sort of deranged personality flaws the characters must posses for this to be considered normal by them the series what ive seen wonderfully utilizes this technique throughout each episode so that character development can occur while the animators are busy focusing on pure gainax hype and freedom its a great change of pace from series which dont even bother giving faces to characters in the background crowds
anime,not_removed,wallpaper material right here boisss
anime,not_removed,flip flappers is one of the best shows ive seen in a while
anime,not_removed,any in
anime,not_removed,a bunch of the first ones are very miyazakiesque
anime,not_removed,so lit rawr xd
anime,not_removed,beautiful
anime,not_removed,overall the art and animation of flip flap is amazing too bad the story is so messed up
anime,not_removed,holy shit cant believe i havent heard the name studio pablo before because they have done some seriously amazing stuff not only flip flappers but heartcatch precure kill la kill and little witch academia all include some of my favorite backgrounds in anime guess its a name to look out for on future shows
anime,not_removed,that at least explains why owari no seraph had such great backgrounds
anime,not_removed,that scifi city still looks pretty awesome
anime,not_removed,seems like a lot of changes are going on with the flifla team
anime,not_removed,which also means that the story wont be placed in the real world anymore
anime,not_removed,that city was pretty awesome so i feel that flifla will be ok in that regard
anime,not_removed,flip flappers is the best anime this season art and animation wise imo you can just stop there
anime,not_removed,you dont have to put imo its already your opinion
anime,not_removed,art wise i prefer occulticnine but yeah flip flappers is beautiful and consistently well animated you can see how much effort they put into it
anime,not_removed,i think yuri on ice has the best animation when they are not suffering from production problems
anime,not_removed,creepy anime grill faces
anime,not_removed,better put that as a cellphone wallpaper
anime,not_removed,that snowy forest where you only see the tree trunks really looks like its from nausicaä
anime,not_removed,the whole ending looks like it could be ghibli work
anime,not_removed,i typically summarize flip flappers as a lesslsd alice in wonderland that music really fits that too
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,it reminds me of the humanity has declined ed
anime,not_removed,well theres that one tool that specializes in upscaling anime images its probably more meant for characters but i just and it got good results for what was the input cityscape i guess screenshotting the scenes directly is a better start
anime,not_removed,yes it does the one is my favorite
anime,not_removed,well thats kind of what animation is anyways people will spend hours on just a few seconds of movement
anime,not_removed,sounds like dating
anime,not_removed,most anime still use backgrounds they just layer them onto blocks where they need to be shifted a bit still stands out like a sore thumb so i dont think you should be too impressed by the very fact its thats still pretty much the standard
anime,not_removed,give in give in give in give in
anime,not_removed,wait werent you that guy that was shitting on this show before
anime,not_removed,too bad
anime,not_removed,genuinely a fantastic team some of the few that are still doing entirely hand painted backgrounds too
anime,not_removed,flowers of evil backgrounds okay now im impressed
anime,not_removed,indeed though if theres one thing that alleviates my unease a bit its that this seems to be a rather coordinated changing of the guard
anime,not_removed,yeah i really do hope the series ends well the last episodes have bene great and itd be such a shame if it fell on the last hurdle i really do think this show can become one of those cult classics that will slowly build in popularity and become a common recommendation but itll only happen if the quality remains consistent right until the end
anime,not_removed,not op i put imo in there so people dont get so rude in replies im not sure why it works but adding it tends raise the civility of replies
anime,not_removed,he doesnt need to put imo because flip flappers is that great and is a fact
anime,not_removed,ive actually been a bit bummed by the animation in yuri definitely looks choppy in a lot of the skating scenes which there are a lot of i still enjoy it a lot but its probably my biggest complaint about it im out of the loop a bit wrt production problems it might have but it seems consistently average in terms of animation
anime,not_removed,the first image in the album looks like kikis
anime,not_removed,cause its by a ghibli animator
anime,not_removed,the ending makes me think of hansel and gretel with the two kids in the scary forest the show itself though yeah it really is like an alice in wonderland on some alternative drug
anime,not_removed,already watched it and liked it and am probably gonna save it to favorites
anime,not_removed,they both somewhat refer to classic tales aside from that they dont feel that similar to me
anime,not_removed,i wouldnt know hahahaha
anime,not_removed,i know they still do in stuff but artworks is easier to do than a good hand draw one which today is going away slowly as they now have a to hand draw filter that do not impress me at all too however the filter itself is amazing
anime,not_removed,there are some extremely unpleasant elements to the series but i have always recognized the things it does well
anime,not_removed,messed up in a bad way do you enjoy the plot do you understand it this series is a mess and its going to end with no answers whatsoever i watch it only because of the gorgeous animation and i wish i will be surprised
anime,not_removed,indeed people seem to forget that people are allowed to have an opinion and when they state an opinion they are stating it as such so many people tend to take things as someone adamantly proclaiming that their opinion is law and fights start
anime,not_removed,its like calling a show overrated vs saying i dont like it as much as everyone else seems to its pretty much the same thing but the latter is just a much nicer way to say it
anime,not_removed,i understand
anime,not_removed,thats the thing its incredibly hard to animate a skating scene and most people expected them to only do a proper skating scene once every two or three episodes instead they are going all out and doing two or three per episode they are obviously getting overwhelmed because of it but i definitely appreciate the effort the studio is putting into the show its equivalent to if in flip flippers they tried animating a papika vs cocona level fight scene twice per episode the animation quality would drop a ton
anime,not_removed,now that you say it been awhile since ive seen kikis
anime,not_removed,funny i was going to say the first image looks like the town at the beginning of howls
anime,not_removed,eh good backgrounds you didnt notice anyway i wouldnt say a good one is easier than a good one because they both have their uses the problem is more that when studios use backgrounds they are often subpar or conflict with the characters which are moving at a lower framerate edit though i do agree a lot of good backgrounds in a series takes more work because you cant reuse it
anime,not_removed,this is a show that doesnt condescend its viewer with explanations or exposition any problems understanding the plot are purely your own i find the show to be engaging mysterious and incredibly intelligent
anime,not_removed,the plot isnt that deep to understand its just a heartfelt story about a shy girl and an eccentric girl going on quests to other worlds to collect shards that have a mystery power its a pretty face value turn your brain off and enjoy the ride type story
anime,not_removed,because thats how language works and people should remember to point out that its just their opinion this matters because when you say best you are saying its quantifiable better than other series whereas if you said flip flappers is my favorite anime of the season in terms of art and animation you are making it more subjective its just a way that makes it easier for people to see where youre coming from i could say glasslip is the best anime ever made in which case i would be stating its simply better than other series you are stating something as a fact rather than as an opinion if i added imo then its more clear if i said glasslip is my fav anime it would be even clearer and people might argue with the point but at that point its just different viewpoints to use this example i would say that i prefer some of the artistic choices in and i am not a fan of the character art in flip flappers the animation is pretty switsh but stylistically im neither here nor there on it same thing with the backgrounds whilst these are nice pieces of art i wouldnt say a lot of them are technically better than whatever other anime you want to pick they are great in terms of keeping with the style of the series though this is why you should make your meanings as clear as possible when communicating online
anime,not_removed,eh quality is much more important in art than quantity id much prefer a few stellar scenes than more mediocre ones none of the skating scenes in yuri have stood out to me as amazing so its hard for me to accept an argument that its amazing by being consistently slightly above average if it is and honestly im not sure about that in a large number of cases and i still think its one of the best shows this year maybe better than flip flappers which is great but would be better if uh it didnt leer at its main characters so often but the animation is the most disappointing part for me this is all imo ofc
anime,not_removed,to be fair they look pretty similar
anime,not_removed,flip flap flip flap is by tomas featchima yume no naka no watashi no yume is by masumi ito whether theyre related or sound alike i cant really say i dont have the best hearing of people
anime,not_removed,i hope youre right ive watched many anime shows that started like this and had high hopes many times but instead of being mysterious and incredibly intelligent usually they end up to be completely random maybe this time it will be different
anime,not_removed,i think people in general should be really careful when they say claim anything is the best at something its why i dont particularly like all those lists that get thrown around all the time especially in the anime community people are fiercely zealous when it comes to their opinion about their favourite shows flip flappers is definitely my favourite show this season though
anime,not_removed,there is no objective best therefore its automatically an opinion so as long as youre not only talking with retarded people theres is really no need to use imo every fkin sentence let alone those people who write whole paragraphs on how much they respect each others opinionswhich should be a given well we i know what you mean its just that its again lowering discussion standards
anime,not_removed,i disagree people should be able to understand the implicit imo rather than op having to explicitly state it i also add imo to the end of most relevant sentences but i shouldnt have to if i was speaking irl thered be no expectation the in my opinion would come across as superfluous and overly formal in most of the cases read that paragraph out loud then read this paragraph i disagree people should be able to understand the implicit imo rather than op having to explicitly stated imo i also add imo to the end of most relevant sentences but i shouldnt have to imo if i was speaking irl thered be no expectation the in my opinion would come across as superfluous and overly formal in most of the cases imo it comes across at least to me as both repetitive and patronising there are times when imo is necessary to clarify things that could be misinterpreted as you stating facts or to try and cool tension in more heated exchanges but we shouldnt have to qualify every opinion with it i know when someones expressing an opinion
anime,not_removed,you didnt think the first skating scene was amazing
anime,not_removed,masumi ito is part of tomas
anime,not_removed,yeah there are in terms of technical quality you can absolutely have bests and worsts in regards to anime people like to dismiss the term a lot but for the most part thats wrong to do so objectively may be the wrong term i guess but youre arguing that critical discussion on a show and a discussion on how enjoyable a show is are the same thing and they just arent thats why we have critics if anything youre the one lowering discussion standards by not making your points clear you cant complain that people misinterpreted your point if you misused words and made your point badly the idea that they should just know what i mean is a poor place for any discussion to start
anime,not_removed,you are overusing for effect but that completely invalidates the point that language is contextual if you say my fav you automatically are stating an opinion if you say the best you are stating as fact it comes across as repetitive and patronizing because you wrote it that way i never said that you have to say it after every sentence as a grammatical rule youre the one going to extremes here you even accept my point youre arguing against a fictional one
anime,not_removed,no i really wanted it to be though
anime,not_removed,didnt know that guess and ubananabm were both on to something then today i learned
anime,not_removed,huh i knew she wrote the song but i didnt know she was actually in tomas neat
anime,not_removed,np but if you in the future wish to find out its written on their mal pages right below staff
anime,not_removed,kek sry but you got too many things wrong to correct them all have fun tho

anime,not_removed,you disappointed me
anime,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomjvcpczxjpg kyoani teased so much with the wallpapers on the beach but there was no beach episode
anime,not_removed,yuri bait is back boiiiisss
anime,not_removed,yuri album feelsgoodman
anime,not_removed,good job op i know that there will be kumiko and reina moments near the beginning but i just want to see more of reina in this season i also know that this season will mainly focus on the years but i hoped people wont be so focused on the ship that they ignored what band is really about
anime,not_removed,in httpsiimgurcomoepslpjjpg reina is dressed as chaika but who is kumiko supposed to be
anime,not_removed,op i love you thank you for this early christmas present
anime,not_removed,sorry if this is a dumb question but are they actually in relationships with one another or is it all undertones
anime,not_removed,
anime,not_removed,bibike yuriphonium
anime,not_removed,great pictures im praying that kyoani lets this ship sail
anime,not_removed,just finished this show yesterday loved these two thanks for this
anime,not_removed,youre not the hero we deserve but definitely the one we need
anime,not_removed,wew lad
anime,not_removed,i want this ship to be real so fucking badly kyoani plz
anime,not_removed,but there was no beach episode yet
anime,not_removed,i really hope there wont be a beach episode this season
anime,not_removed,if what i have heard about the source material is true s then there aint going to be a ship to be hung up on for these two
anime,not_removed,from amagi brilliant park
anime,not_removed,sylphy as everyone already said it is a va thing p
anime,not_removed,i mean both claim to do a confession of love to each other at a point of the showyou interpret take that as a undertone if want
anime,not_removed,its all undertones theyve also used dialogue to set up straight crushes for each character too so if youre watching for yuri shipping prepare to get disappointed
anime,not_removed,if this was a western book instead of an anime i would give it an chance that they are into each other and will probably become a couple the other consist among other thing of a it never becoming clear before the story ends bthem just being really close friends c being bi and choosing some guy instead d western work also sometimes just play up romantic undertones between two womangirls without it going anywhere etc since it is an anime it is just yuri bait and nothing will come of it so yes undertones very strong undertones but nothing explicit has been said so the chances of something coming of it are as always quite low
anime,not_removed,anybody but that dude whose name i cant remember that has all the personality of a wet sock
anime,not_removed,my favourite ship of any series
anime,not_removed,why not it would make for a funny episode
anime,not_removed,in the first season they already adapted the s in a way that gives shuuichi way less screentime and instead gives it to reina kumiko x reina is probably not gonna happen but it is definitely more likely than shuuichi x kumiko
anime,not_removed,kyoani has a tendency to buy rights to sources and then ignore those sources when it doesnt fit what they want to do they added so much to kon that wasnt in the manga half the characters in chuunibyou are anime original and amagi brilliant park was apparently nothing like the source just because its in the novel doesnt mean its what kyoanis gonna do
anime,not_removed,this bugs me too i cant believe its all that people mention and its so badly misinterpreted its very clearly not yuribait the reina plot was her opening up to kumiko and them being honest with each other thats what that budget smile was a reward for kumiko being honest theres a good contrast with asuka never letting down her demeanor here too plus theres all this other super tangible super relatable drama stuff that anyone who was in a band will relate to in an instant the aspirations vs taking things easy with aoi and the director the kids practicing so hard and getting cut its all much much much more powerful and important than whatever you can read into a noseflick i wanted to tell the anime fanbase to grow up when i read the reactions to this show theres an undertone but its not worth more than an acknowledgement or comment on how it adds to the confusion kumiko is feeling the old friend shuuichi has as much sexual tension with kumiko as reina
anime,not_removed,but rather hype some yuri ship triggered dont just brush it aside like that the ship is so much more than that you dont call it a ship when its oreki chitanda its not just some yuri ship its a genuine lesbian romance story which are so fucking rare in anime s and dont mention the light novels the anime was clearly directed in a way that pushed the lesbian side of things i will admit that im worried about for this reason though im worried because if they ruin the romance that theyve built up the story will be ruined alongside it that the settingbackstory is engaging is testament to the quality of the show any good romance story is not just about the romance after all it should be about the characters their growth and what makes them fit together
anime,not_removed,ahhh okie dokie weird that they chose characters from two different series and studios
anime,not_removed,it is a va thing that makes sense now thanks
anime,not_removed,if reina were a guy no one would be saying the romance was just undertones after that scene in episode the opposition to this ship exists simply because homophobes dont want to accept the idea that two girls can be in love
anime,not_removed,hibike is not a funny anime
anime,not_removed,this comment has been removed due to a recent rule revision all spoilers must include the title of the source being spoiled in the description of the spoiler tag please note that we no longer support the use of those red spoiler tags anymore so ignore that please edit your comment as such and reply to this and it will be reapproved you have not received an infraction have a question or think this removal was an error dont know the rules read them ranimewikirules
anime,not_removed,i dont agree with what the guy above said at all as its neither a yuri ship nor do people brush aside the story in favor of the romance like they seem to think but please dont use unironically use triggered like that its going to give me cancer also its not a lesbian romance story with everything else being its backstory its a story that just happens to have a supposed lesbian relationship in it which is a much bigger step forward for representation due the normalcy with which its treated that aside it doesnt even qualify as a lesbian romance as the source novel will be decanonizing the relationship in favor of a heterosexual one so dont hold your breath in hopes that kyoani will retain it for season
anime,not_removed,different series sure but was actually by the same studio that did hibike euphonium kyoto animation you should check it out it was a fun show for me
anime,not_removed,i wouldnt go as far as to say homophobic but it sure fucking sucks being constantly reminded that heteronormativity is still a thing
anime,not_removed,no it comes from the source material not having yuri undertones at all the yuriness of the show is bait to sell merch like crazy i doubt it will end with anything
anime,not_removed,nah only a small section would be upset
anime,not_removed,entire anime community hahaha
anime,not_removed,what ive gathered they dont really like that part of their fan base so s theyre not going to ship them i think the yuri bait is in fact a bait it was only added to boost disc and merch sales so they can fully adapt the series
anime,not_removed,done
anime,not_removed,not that i dont agree with you but it wouldnt be the first time kyoani has made changes to the story that werent in the source material
anime,not_removed,but please dont use unironically use triggered like that its going to give me cancer yah boo ill use what words i want punk but really whats your issue its just slang now also its not a lesbian romance story with everything else being its backstory its a story that just happens to have a supposed lesbian relationship in it mmm yeah alright that is a better description i had a false dichotomy in my head didnt occur to me that a noncentral relationship could still be more than a ship that aside it doesnt even qualify as a lesbian romance as the source novel theyre not the same though people have pointed out clear places where the anime differed from the novels im definitely not holding my breath for season as i said elsewhere in the thread anime does not have a good track record when it comes to lesbian romance so much teasing they dont take it seriously
anime,not_removed,oh go fuck yourself i just said i care about the character development or the conveying of tension that a band experiences because its central to the story
anime,not_removed,see ore monogatari beach episode as an example character development for the characters and was funny
anime,not_removed,approved sorry it took so long
anime,not_removed,all those teases mean absolutely nothing in terms of an actual romantic relationship if it was a western novel you wouldnt be saying that but it is true that given the history of lesbian romance in anime it is probably a doomed hope but why am i even arguing youre just a throwaway account o not quite just an alt i mean no disrespect also i didnt downvote you if thats been bothering you edit hmm if they scrap the romance i dont necessarily think that makes me look silly i think it makes them look silly
anime,not_removed,wow you must be fun at parties
anime,not_removed,all i said in my initial post was that people should praise the show for other reasons than the yuri ship because apparently that is the only thing people like about the anime im fine with that just dont belittle the yuri ship huh i dont actually care if its western or not lol this has nothing to do with it by that i mean a western novel wouldnt just throw in those teases for fun if it was a serious novel it would be very very obvious that this was a romance the only reason theres any doubt is because anime has a proven track record of using this kind of thing purely as a tease especially when its lesbian but the reason i feel its different this time the reason i take it seriously is because its such a good story in other ways it feels like a serious novel the irony is that the light novels really did use it as just a tease although it wasnt so pronounced in the novels i guess
anime,not_removed,haha fair enough peace
anime,not_removed,theyre by the same composer
anime,not_removed,no they have some similarities but dont sound remotely alike
anime,not_removed,a likely explanation httpsenwikipediaorgwikitemptrack
anime,not_removed,are they actually
anime,not_removed,that thumbnail alone is nightmare fuel
anime,not_removed,i remember when dansgaming played this game for horror month it was hilarious
anime,not_removed,could we nsfw that thumbnail
anime,not_removed,oh god the flashbacks
anime,not_removed,episodes out but no topic im too lazy to make one myself anyway i liked the part with the monster will spend more minutes on it next week
anime,not_removed,ok ill bite do i drop acid before after or during watching
anime,not_removed,ahh i remember this game when pewdipie played it it was one of the first and funiiest videos i started to know him and then i started to play it too and then there was a liveaction movie adaption and finally this we came full circle
anime,not_removed,the original funimation version should have it afaik the kai version does not
anime,not_removed,give a try its art style takes a little getting used to but its a very sweet romance movie
anime,not_removed,no is one theres also evangelion but the malemale romance only lasts an episode late into the series
anime,not_removed,maybe love stage what youre looking for basically is the shounen ai category but theres little i would recommend from it if you want something considered a proper romance one of the biggest franchises is junjou romantica where one of the main characters still insists he doesnt even like men after like a billion episodes theres also all the kono danshi ovas but they generally all end as soon as someone confessestheres a kiss
anime,not_removed,seconding it really good movie
anime,not_removed,i might check it online just a pity it seems to not be available on dvd anywhere then again its new so
anime,not_removed,i literally just finished watching this five minutes ago gave it a personally i loved the art style
anime,not_removed,seems like doukyuusei is the best option i have then will have to figure out a way to find it on dvd its just such a shame you know im usually into fighting and action and fantastical elements but no such anime nor movie nor show in general exists where they have a proper male gay romance or none i can find at least
anime,not_removed,dangit if only was available on dvd anywhere xd lol must find that one sometime but yeah not sure about evangelion working for me personally
anime,not_removed,hmmm i might end up trying love stage will think about it
anime,not_removed,junjou romantica isnt really the best considering theres sexual assault rape in the very first episode
anime,not_removed,i said proper not a guys flirt and kiss then leave each other for girls
anime,not_removed,yeah thats why i said i wouldnt recommend it the main relationship is awful
anime,not_removed,what do you mean about it soon getting better after getting worse and yeah i suppose youre right guess i have to wait another years except i really dont want to have to do that my depression drives me insane as it is now im desperate you know xp yet also seemingly picky apparently and yeah im afraid i do not read novels sorry and if i recall correctly you had no way of keeping contact outside of reddit right a bit of a shame id love to be able to instantchat with you either on facebook or skype
anime,not_removed,oh that is really depressing concerning anime but heck even now we mostly just see ambigious shit and offensive stereotypes like leeron littner in gurren lagann do you really need to rub it in and not respect that im not a novel person its not a matter of surprising myself with fanfiction or whatever im a visual person i care about a story being envisioned reading it just feels like im experiencing something that could be if anything it just makes me more depressed and ive tried to find webcomics but even if i could it wouldnt work for me much either im a collector and i like to collect physical copies of things that i end up enjoying and fandom no just no wouldnt help me at all look i know youre just trying to help but stuff like that doesnt help me and also i guess then i got no other way to contact you outside of here fine then oh well
