asoiaf,removed,as long as grrm doesnt look like he will die soon i can be patient
asoiaf,removed,call it what it is nazsurprised
asoiaf,removed,probably a lot better than if grrm choked to death on a lamprey pie while wearing boiled leather
asoiaf,removed,if he was not fat or not old or a faster writer i would be able to do that easier but considering all thinks my fear of he dying before finishing the series makes me too worried and paranoid to be able to invest as much time in other series
asoiaf,removed,youre also forgetting hes also a wealthy man who has good medivle care and lives in new mexico pretty good factors leading to a pretty good life span
asoiaf,removed,damn how many posts bitching about this do we need each day
asoiaf,removed,at this rate hell die before he even starts it
asoiaf,removed,as others have said pretty indifferent george has lost my respect and my patronage screw him ill just find out the end of the story through the show lets face it even if twow does come out i seriously doubt ados ever will
asoiaf,removed,i cant believe youre being upvoted for this drivel
asoiaf,removed,exactly how i feel right now because i already know theres no chance its coming out in does anyone seriously believe this honestlyare people really that naive that each year they truly believe hes somehow gonna finish the whole book in months
asoiaf,removed,this is one of the dumbest things ive ever read on this subreddit you should be ashamed of yourself
asoiaf,removed,lol you are literally delusional if you honestly believe you will read the end of this series mate im totally serious and im totally right and everyone with a shred of unbiased sense knows this
asoiaf,removed,like this entire phony thread holden caulfield thinks youre all phonys phony
asoiaf,removed,nothing bothers me more nothing than people spitting out this i dont want him to rush it line rush it are you freaking kidding me you dont want it rushed please please stop this complete bs
asoiaf,removed,redundant i dont think it means what you think it means
asoiaf,removed,im not defending him you stupid fucker im saying dany cheated in the deal while he did not that doesnt excuse his sins outside the deal
asoiaf,removed,good thing opinions are wellopinions to each their own
asoiaf,removed,no im saying she cheated the fucking deal jfc learn to fucking read
asoiaf,removed,this entire thread was kicked off by people claiming g otherwise next time read the thread before chiming in with your dumb ass comments
asoiaf,removed,not abut opinions youre just self deluded into believing hes not rushing when really hes not writing
asoiaf,removed,rip grrm eventually
asoiaf,removed,first episode i got a glimpse of was the one where yoren sacrificed himself i thought it was some cheesy musketeers thing
asoiaf,removed,op assumes that there a chances that it will come out oh my sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,if i remember correctly from the hbo inside the series the blue color in danys clothes is a dothraki thing its a rare color for them that they make crushing insects and they use in special ocasions khal drogo have body marks of this blue ink in his chest dany adopted the color after the khal death more specifically the first time she uses it is in qarth before that she used to wear basic dothraki brown clothes the hbo book says that is her history that was being told with her clothes so the blue is dany as a khaleesi embracing the dothraki culture in qarth and slavers bay she wear a mix of dothraki and local fashion next hbo season according to the leaks shes going to wear her house colors preparing to be a targaryen queen
asoiaf,removed,i mean at that point in all honesty well be lucky if grrm is still in a state to even write books going from his bodily health
asoiaf,removed,anyone who is completely retarded would say so
asoiaf,removed,assuming he dies before completing the series which is really an asinine assumption to make
asoiaf,removed,i would probably say but he still alive right ooooooook cool
asoiaf,removed,if you uironically enjoyed that line youre years old
asoiaf,removed,having hopes at all pleb
asoiaf,removed,if he isnt going to finish the book he needs to pass his notes to someone more talented and passionate who can
asoiaf,removed,httpsgfycatcomoblonggloomycommabutterfly
asoiaf,removed,yeah because hes king of a massive empire now hes got more on his plate quit whining and let him do what he wants
asoiaf,removed,do you really think the show can even spoil anything though without aegon the dornish plot illyrios plots howland reed eurons craziness stannis arc etc the most spoil we can expect is whether a couple main characters die and even then without all the other pieces in play who knows whether or not thatll even be the same for instance without aegon how can we reasonably expect danys plot to be remotely the same without doran and arianne scheming how can the kl plot end the same without euron and victarion having dragonbinder how can anything with her plot be the same we may see some minor spoilers but theres little chance itll be anything worth worrying about when many of the most interesting book plots arent even in the show at this point
asoiaf,removed,hes still morbidly obese and a gentleman of a certain age thats not gratuitous negativity but pure fact
asoiaf,removed,this is not the most tinfoil theory but it is one that does not get a lot of acceptance when the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers azor ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone jon is azor ahai reborn when the red star bleeds a bleeding star commanding them was ser patrek of kings mountain clad in his knightly raiment of white and blue and silver his cloak a spatter of fivepointed stars wun weg wun dar wun howled again and gave ser patreks other arm a twist and pull it tore loose from his shoulder with a spray of bright red blood like a child pulling petals off a daisy thought jon leathers talk to him calm him the old tongue he understands the old tongue keep back the rest of you and the darkness gathers it is no secret that the others and the dead things in the forest are gathering to cover the world in darkness azor ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt i think mel will burn shireen kings blood to revive jon in the books the smoke would be from her pyre the salt the tears in her eyes figuratively making jon born again to wake dragons there are at least two dragons missing since the dance of the dragons years ago cannibal the cannibal was a wild dragon that lived on dragonstone during the dance of the dragons he was called cannibal by the smallfolk of dragonstone because he would practice cannibalism feasting on dead or newborn dragons and dragon eggs the cannibal was black as coal he was the largest and oldest of the wild dragons sheepstealer sheepstealer was a wild dragon during the dance of the dragons with a taste for mutton it lived at the back of dragonmont and would hunt between driftmark and wendwater the smallfolk of dragonstone named it for a selfevident reason sheepstealers coloring was an ugly mud brown he was hatched when king jaehaerys i targaryen was young which would put him around years old at the time of the civil war out of stone skagos the name skagos means stone in the old tongue one last piece that foreshadows jon linked to sheepstealer he had to get down on his knees to gather up the books hed dropped i should not have brought so many he told himself as he brushed the dirt off colloquo votars jade compendium a thick volume of tales and legends from the east that maester aemon had commanded him to find the book appeared undamaged maester thomaxs dragonkin being a history of house targaryen from exile to apotheosis with a consideration of the life and death of dragons had not been so fortunate it had come open as it fell and a few pages had gotten muddy including one with a rather nice picture of balerion the black dread done in colored inks sam cursed himself for a clumsy oaf as he smoothed the pages down and brushed them off sam carrying books to jon about the history of house targaryen and a drawing of a targaryen dragon is covered in brown mud tldr jon is azor ahai reborn he will be revived by mel who will burn shireen to do so jon will then go to skagos to wake sheepstealer the dragon
asoiaf,removed,im not taking rlj as a fact its just the most logical theory with all the clues if there are a better alternative then i wont mind but rld isnt a better alternative its a crappy theory with no evidence or hints makes no sense full of plot holes and screwed up timelines and illogical decisions by characters thats why im sticking with rlj for now and if you actually paid attention while reading the books watching the show or if youve seen grrm interviews then you would know that your theory doesnt make sense it requires everyone in the series to lie make illogical choices which in mist cases are out of character for some you need brandon to impregnat ashara by telepathy or ashara carrying jon in her womb for over a year grrm would have to lie about everything he have told us and this is just some of the plot holes and u dont seem to actually read my comments you said that dany would be a secret stark thats doesnt make sense dany would have her father family name not her mother they will say she is a targaryen not a stark and if she was a bastard they will say she is a targ bastard not stark bastard so she will be a secret targaryen instead of a targaryen she already have dragons she doesnt need to be the song of ice and fire lol i will love to see the reaction of the few people like you who actually believe this theory when the sixth book is released
asoiaf,removed,what a self righteous person you must be you didnt make shit so get that through your head i think his work made him and thats enough to think that is fucking with you or other fans is delusional at best
asoiaf,removed,neil gaiman says george rr martin is not your bitch but right now you sound like his
asoiaf,removed,bottom line is grrm is rich grrm is an artist he doesnt need to churn out his art to satisfy whiny entitled brats like you there are literally millions of other books go read them if you dont want the show to pass the books dont fucking watch it its not impossible to stay away from spoilers one of my friends just finished the first book and didnt even know ned died do you really think youre self righteous bullshit is going to make him release the book sooner no hes going to release it when it is done in his eyes the fact you literally think hes doing this to spite the audience is childish anyway i know ill get downvoted to oblivion like i always do but like i always say you spoiled fucks can downvote me all you want but grrm still isnt going to release it any sooner the show still pulled ahead of the book and no one gives a shit what you think
asoiaf,removed,well at least in the show dany is off kidnapped somewhere and not making me dislike her stupid childish actions
asoiaf,removed,ados by elio and linda garciau
asoiaf,removed,does this work for you not everyone is the same that should be pretty obvious to say that everyone should have this mentality towards how they write is a bit extreme do you have like little birds spying on him to see if hes writing or not why dont you want to believe he doesnt want it finished
asoiaf,removed,whatever calling it like i see it i say fuck sometimes deal with it
asoiaf,removed,apart from the magic powers that came with it pretty sure id rather get raped than be a cripple
asoiaf,removed,guys who dont socialize with women describe women as whales its the redditor who comments on a celebrities photo about how hed never stick his dick in that because shes dressed in what he considers a slutty fashion chris rock said it best of people boycotting the enemies it doesnt matter cause you werent invited im not some white knight or sjw i just loathe that comic book guy archetype that might be a zit faced lard butt in socks and sandals who still manages to be a raging sexist
asoiaf,removed,i take it you dont read much fantasy do you
asoiaf,removed,out of context so someone elses arousal was arousing not the best sure ill agree doesnt really change the fact that a lot of literary masterpieces also have dumb out of context quotes that is just the way with some people they get down on a thing when they dont know nothing about it ― mark twain the adventures of huckleberry finn miss watson your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below pikesville and mr phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send huck finn i am still a little afraid of missing something if i forget that as my father snobbishly suggested and i snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parceled out unequally at birth the great gatsby i told that boy about the ice myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders these people you have to keep after them all the time she looked at me and laughed pointlessly the great gatsby how the hell does someone laugh pointlessly does laughing ever have a point you seem like you literally hate asoiaf from your post history what the hell is your point
asoiaf,removed,dont worry in ados grrm will definitely find a way to say that rlj was a red herring and confirm that baj probably using some sort of bran timeywimey time traveling fetus weirwoodnet blaze it faggots
asoiaf,removed,bare assertion based on fuckall as is your standard reply based on tmy assumption that you have been using book obara to describe show obara no i didnt for obara and you have no reason beyond your own ignorance to think so yes you did so if you didnt then use examples of the show only to illustrate everything you said about her if you manage to do this ill drop this argument nym is characterised on the show exactly as ive written maybe in your headcanon actually she is just ss number i doubt show onlies even know her name as of right now and a person more observant than yourself would know that and that would be you the one who is deliberately arguing against me how convenient no u o u find your own memes i have and have repeated called you out on the irrelevance of but muh potential can you at least explain why do ou think it is irrelevant instead of because im saying it so can you at least explain that when martin already gave statements saying that the dorne party has a nice role to play in twow which is partly due to the set up they received before in the story that does not make them the same thing im really sorry you dont know what words mean im really sorry you have yet to understand thatwhat ive said is that theyre effectively one trait for her character because her sexuality is shown by her being seductive so its irrelevant to use both terms to describe her in what way all the way show obaras only characterization is i fight fer dorne and the fact that she is a brute who likes to kill even her own family book obara is a fundamentally a short tempered warrior with a backstory that works better the way it was presented in the books than in the show futhermore she has more potential than showobara even if its due to the circumstances she is in i admit she is the less interesting ss in the book though in the series theyre all equally uninteresting a cherrypicking b its literary not a same way youve been doing regarding typos and etc anyway it isnt cherrypicking its just the truth b muh proper grammar and its not becaise i said so this literary sums up your arguments im sorry visual media exist deal with it sorry youre bad at reading people and watching things also the very fact that you can say that shows a difference between them a difference you claimed didnt exist its impossible to actually get her character the way you got when she had such small appearances in everything including being virtually the less important ss and when her character wasnt even exactly estabilished i could say she isnt smug but that she is a joker i could say that she isnt a joker but that she is easily bored and likes to complain see these are all headcanons like the ones you created by supposedly observing her face that sounds like a personal problem of yours nice assumption but that isnt the case im not defending them in the slightest by trying to equalize them with their better writte versions youre fndamentally defending them as any literate person reading this thread could discern im saying theyre shit then stop trying to create headanons for their show characters and martins versions were equally shit explain how theyre characters their story isnt over yet my main point was that they have their potential and estabilished characteristics theyre diverse and not just basically the same in their core like the show snakes thats why you dont see a as much as hate towards them compared to show snakes the show snakes arent over yet too but the show likes to cut characters the ss already reached the top with their mother and they received no in depth characterization while doing so its far more likely that they will end up dying without any more relevance and its something you agreed with me about i agree the only similarity between the two is that you fail at both behaving as if he knows my personal life treating pointless internet discussion as serious business how pathetic can you get you are actually delusional were done after this empty claims and did not counter any of my arguments while doing this typical i agree it still gives them more of your precious potential though no it does not book snakes are separated each of them in a specific storyline playing their main strenghts therfeore they have more of a chance to be potential wildcards also dont forget the fact that dorne party being relevant in twow was called out by martin himself show snakes already reached the top once they conquered dorne and almsot no one likes them focusing on them isnt a priority for the show so its unlikely they will have any great scene besides their obvious demise tldr you dont know what potential means entirely immaterial iits immaterial and irrelevant because im saying so great argument that will show me im really not oh so youre just plainly retarded then my bad yet another logical fallacy you cant comprehend you said it couldnt be that bad because it was popular well the showsneks cant be that bad then because the shows popular what you said and because you personally like cheap writing stunts that are beneath a telenovela script what i said implying something like that would sell as much as adwd did i was saying there is a degree of quality in adwd otherwise it wouldnt be a success if something is crap it will eventually flop or at least be regarded entirely bad by critics and major part of the population neither of these happened to adwd there is also a degree of quality in the series and thats why it performed so well along with a few hiccups along the way basically what im saing is quality work leads to a series being well loved most of the times if its a crappy series and it manages to stay on top for awhile then its momentum goes down soon enough this is not necessarily appeal to popularity because im not saying that something popular must be good what im saying is that in adwds case the popularity was sustained because its legitimately a good book and not absolute crap as youve implied yes try making more relevant comments next time ironic coming from you i wouldnt waste my breath thats exactly what you are doing though i didnt it was explicit you were implying what i wrote had no merit of response because of your own distorted view of things it isnt explicit because it isnt true it was just an implication made by you that has no basis on reality and i wasnt i wasnt wrong because im saying so believe me
asoiaf,removed,triggered
asoiaf,removed,believe me when i say i didnt really wanted the discussion to turn out like this i was just expressing my opinion i was very clear regarding that at first but then he just couldnt take it well anywaythat was my last reply to this specific debate as youre indeed right it turned into a no u discussion and surprisingly enough a serious internet grammar battle at this point i should have ended this much sooner
asoiaf,removed,cant find it but i found a youtube link
asoiaf,removed,nah youre just fat sorry
asoiaf,removed,youre right word would never spread that someone had risen from death whats christianity again
asoiaf,removed,lets be honest they only made middlefimbers ignorant of ramsay the hedgehog because otherwise the plot theyd made wouldnt work similarly umber who is only in two episodes this season which should tell you something gives rickon over because there has to be something that draws jon and sansa south with an army to rescue him plus it gives them a chance to make horrible things happen to a stark which will spawn a thousand shitty reaction videos i honestly think the show would be much better were the showrunners not writing for the fucking retarded watch me make stupid faces at tv shows twat demographic which sadly comprises most of their audience now
asoiaf,removed,oh my god check out rfuckolly
asoiaf,removed,maybe dont be an asshole next time unless you know youre right shithead
asoiaf,removed,it seriously feels like this season is being written by this subreddit omfg gaiz wat if edd was el cee teehee lol dick jokes hur hur super daario brothers girls that i like i arr el really like sansa now cuz rape so brienne should protect her girl powah arbitrary montage i dont like littlefinger no camera time cuz dwarf peepee quips lul fuck u ollieeeeee
asoiaf,removed,hahahah you were going to report me and cry harassment because you were wrong some people
asoiaf,removed,stop with this plot armor bull shit i swear you idiots just parrot eachother no one has a goddamn thought of their own
asoiaf,removed,lmao itt alot of salty bastards
asoiaf,removed,oh so youve abandoned your men just hate hot girls thats why sansa was criticized not bad writing narrative congrats
asoiaf,removed,sansa was never close with jon prior to leaving wf i mean they grew up together id think they have a much stronger relationship than her and lysa lysa was also known to be pretty unhinged before they met i just buyt this shit where sansa shouldnt trust jon he has literally no reason to betray her and hes the first actual northern family shes been reunited with if anything this is the time where you go back to putting your trust in people have you read the books youd know that sansa and jon were never close if you had ive read the books and i have no idea what youre talking about theres like pages sorry if i missed a line where sansa said she wasnt close to jon or something regardless the books are irrelevant right now because were talking about the show so now sansa is also wary of the people she should be able to trust even blood relatives even people she grew up with so therefore she should sacrifice her her super honourable brother her who has no reason to betray her and thousands of men makes sense theon betrayed her family too just like basically everyone else shes known except for literally every stark and the tyrells but sure everyone sansa is going to be distrustful of everyone for a long time and for very valid reasons shes traumatized sigh okay you win im not debating it anymore if you think being betrayed by littlefinger and cersei means she wants to kill her brother and tons of her kin and lose a battle for her home then fine be an inbred fucking retard im done
asoiaf,removed,its absolutely fine for you to dislike a certain character even hate them i have nothing against you so you dont need to take things to a personal level i never mentioned feminism im not a feminist so im not sure where youre getting that from i mean when you say shit like this thank you my thoughts exactly part of me does wonder if reddit is projecting some kind of weird hatred of hot girls onto sansa i cant think of a male character that received this level of hate it comes off as feminist rhetoric and calling people who criticize her character women haters just a tip for the future
asoiaf,removed,fuck you cunt
asoiaf,removed,no and if grrm isnt taking the poll then the poll means nothing no offense but who gives a shit what the rest of you think

asoiaf,removed,grrm said it himself that there are three great mysteries this season and that two of them have so far been resolved are you sure i thought grrm told dnd holy shit moments before the series even started shireen hodor and one other hodor was revealed this season further there is absolutely no way the showrunners would leave toj where they left it and end this season of course they wont ned will enter the tower find lyanna in distress shell die ned will be left holding a baby but i dont think were going to have an indepth discussion and reveal of everything that happened it wont be said that the baby is jon but this will be obvious or that the father is rhaegar thatll be done next season tomorrow we will find out who jons parents really are and reddit will never be the same i dont think well be any closer to that reveal than in the books except well have confirmation that lyanna gave birth at the tower

asoiaf,removed,im not saying he will die or he wont im just saying that bloodraven has been very upfront about the fact that bran will be leaving soon enough and that this is just training also what the cof says to meera i find it hard to believe that the cof and bloodraven wouldnt see others approaching their secret fortress in advance enough to get bran out of there without there having to be fighting that said i dont think bloodraven can walk i hope his death isnt a shot for shot of ben kenobi v vader kinda accept my faith and i become one with magic nonsense bloodraven is really powerful i cant see him not knowing that people approach his secret cave hasnt he been there for like a mad wild amount of time like decades if not more he likely has a very good sense of the area also we do see a bunch of cof in the trailer maybe that scene with the roots and whatever isnt bloodraven invadeddying but a flashback being shown of cof being invaded by the others and maybe explaining that historical conflict to bran so he has a better understanding of how to beat them and their motives seems like a very bloodraven thing to do

asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,sorry if this is going to sound a bit salty but you people always need something to complain about dont you i mean what more can a scene with sansa reacting to jons resurrection add to the story she would most likely ask about what he saw and he will reply with the same thing he told mel what do you want to see
asoiaf,removed,can one kind fella pm me the leaks thanks in advance
asoiaf,removed,tommen is going to kill himself
asoiaf,removed,lyanna was the reason for a massive rebellion but then only six guys n ned cared to keep looking after the war sohuh thats american level propoganda at work if you still buy that and they buried rhaegar at sea because reasons right
asoiaf,removed,caption a dragon gotta eat nigga dialogue cut from show
asoiaf,removed,showrunners even spell it out in the behind the scenes for you pedantic cunts sorry had to do in sandor voice normal me would have just said go and watch the behind the scenes cunts
asoiaf,removed,nor now that i think about it have donald j trump and robin the boy wonder
asoiaf,removed,very interesting and what are your thoughts on the theory that gregor clegane is sandor cleganes brother
asoiaf,removed,not to be a party pooper but this is a well known theory if not fact on this subreddit then again the whole point of this subreddit is to cycle years old theories round and round so im glad you brought it up again for new people
asoiaf,removed,this is oddly reminiscent of the old rasoiafcirclejerk auto mod
asoiaf,removed,thats not how my internet works at all if only i could instantly watch a video and understand it
asoiaf,removed,this isnt a theory youre just reading a paragraph from the books to us
asoiaf,removed,chekovs horn that wall is coming down take that donald trump
asoiaf,removed,so the leaked synopsis of wass brienne meets an old friend turned foepeople assumed it to be jaimie but if she is meeting jaimie in this episodewho could she meet in
asoiaf,removed,okay i actually was being sarcastic as i dont understand this tread but here goes then moat caillin is in a giant swamp after the rising of the waters you can not build or keep repairing something that is rotting apart and sinking exspecially if you are a simple mason from westeros no one have even wanted to attack it so far that goes for the bolton army coming back upall northerners and now the whole army of the vale is waiting there if even the untouched army of the vale do not even think about just crashing through it that means its still a suicide attempt if you try taking it seeing as it only need to be manned by men to keep anybody for trying to take it coupled with no fields for food growing means that you cant just live there because you want to you can have a small garrison thats just big enough to hold of sieges from anyone trying does this answer the question
asoiaf,removed,im so happy hes making money honestly all the talentless fucks out there who explode like shades of grey lady or twilight author georgie boy i hope theres blonde girls polishing your cock off every night after you down a goblet of gravy and several whole turkeys i hope your pillows are made of exotic spidersilk and you got a gold toilet like pablo escobar i hope you live to and earn million more dollars until then and i wish to all these frustrated people who talk shit about you to get laid and find happiness outside the realm of your majestically crafted novels
asoiaf,removed,this rules enforcement seems to be so arbitrarily enforced its a joke
asoiaf,removed,he aint expecting shit from you buy it or dont grrm is not your bitch
asoiaf,removed,no you have not consistently applied that rule its a complete guess as to whether the mods will remove comments about grrms health or age it looks to be applied in a totally arbitrary manner you might as well quote a moderation policy of dont do bad stuff
asoiaf,removed,not only has bran never forgotten about himself when consciously warging summer this is just wrong
asoiaf,removed,we know reworking valyrian steel requires blood sacrifices so maybe creating valyrian steel requires you to sacrifice dragons
asoiaf,removed,theres still a couple hundreds in the world though not just a handful
asoiaf,removed,why not rape meera as summer though
asoiaf,removed,since i was told be nice by blackfish let me reiterate i am not surprised at all about this or the other announcement grrm is a low person who somehow by some miracle managed to start a really good story out of the several less than good efforts
asoiaf,removed,i definitely missed things when i was reading but part of the fun was figuring those things out for yourself i definitely forgot a few characters and place names as i went along but it wasnt too confusing there were a bunch of plot points that came as a real surprise for me that im sure other people would have predicted like the ending of book for example it seems so obvious now that there are dragons in got but when i first read it i had no idea and all through that book everyone is going on about how magic isnt real and her eggs are duds and i so hoped they would hatch but its almost like i didnt want to get my hopes up and then when they did hatch it was so exciting that i could barely read the pages because was literally rolling around on my bed screaming so there were definitely good things about reading it when it was more unknown but having the online community is so great for reference but also just to engage with other fans especially after really heavy episodes of the show p
asoiaf,removed,the difference is that trump is actually a simpleton
asoiaf,removed,or a tommen who went bad iirc he had a dubious older brother who met an untimely demise
asoiaf,removed,apparently not since it got downvoted people on this site sometime i swear
asoiaf,removed,not a safe city with rebel groups like isis and the faith militant in the area
asoiaf,removed,i have enjoyed his work much more than the other two classic authors so opinions vary enjoy yours
asoiaf,removed,id build a wall and make the westerlands pay for it
asoiaf,removed,dont waste your energy mods are bored obviously
asoiaf,removed,be careful you spoil by omitting the spoiler tag d
asoiaf,removed,stop my penis can only get so hard
asoiaf,removed,apparently its not just jon who knows nothing just kidding but seriously youd do better without the attitude like we are a community here and its not cool that any disagreement is removed unless given in the form you deem appropriate like sure dont fill up an unrelated topic with it but a brief explanation and then an invitation to discuss them further in the ways you suggested but you know an invitation without cutting them off which comes across as attitude would go a long way
asoiaf,removed,do you really think nobody had the same thought in years
asoiaf,removed,house obama approves
asoiaf,removed,this is very depressing a dying country trying to appeal to world that its still a place of life being from a nonarabic country in the middleeast i dont understand why religion is so important to destroy lives because of it in such scale i understand that every country here is a tyranny worse than the one next to it however in syrias case the rebels are to be blamed and the countries that support them they started a war knowing they cannot win and from those rebels and that war came isis and a dozen other religious extremists groups and to anyone who disagrees they should try to explain why before the war syria was so much worse than this that this became a necessary tyranny is no good but if thats the only way of having stability then so be it a generation or two doomed because of this and even if the rebels win they have already shown they are no better than the ruling regime and might even be worse asoiaf is true to history and reality and just so there are no good men only bad and worse maybe one the middleeast will be free of religion and petty superstitious indifference maybe then everything will be fine here
asoiaf,removed,yes only you the biggest fan the person who knows it all the theoretician that was promised azor ahai reborn the burnt you know everything only you
asoiaf,removed,or maybe he should either admit hes given up on the series and be honest with the fans i wouldnt want to force an old guy whos clearly wants to do other stuff to sit down for hours everyday to write something hes clearly got no interest in anymore or maybe he should stop attending all those damn conventions and finish the damn series
asoiaf,removed,i am not agreeing to the idea it is used as a relief of her periods i am disagreeing to the idea that anything from cerseis point of view is reliable
asoiaf,removed,come to central aleppo where you can have the harrenhal experience first hand ever wanted to know what it feels like to be under seige well aleppo is for you
asoiaf,removed,i enjoyed the read as i always do but nigga u cray cray
asoiaf,removed,because magic magic provided a means to do all those things remember it has only recently disappeared with the death of the last dragon now that magic is gone the world will innovate that is unless dannys dragons revive the species and bring magic back couple that with martins poor understanding of measurements or cultural development and thats how you get a couple thousand year old country that has changed relatively little
asoiaf,removed,isis probably
asoiaf,removed,when the backdoor smells better than the front
asoiaf,removed,id love them to do the aegon jon connington chapters animated
asoiaf,removed,pls george
asoiaf,removed,sure thing i didnt consider this policing mostly i was making a joke reference to meryn trants too old comment
asoiaf,removed,retort fuck that hack he might crank them out but his work is piss compared to grrms
asoiaf,removed,my guess is that most days he doesnt even sit down to try to write he just sits down in his kitchen and eats pizzas and burgers and then go to the bathroom and spends the rest of his day trying to shit
asoiaf,removed,because he replied to me obviously and unless you have a quote of martin saying edmure treated his prisoners inhumanly then you are wrong and full of shit
asoiaf,removed,itd retard basterd strength
asoiaf,removed,as long as you say man this show sucks instead of man dd are stupid talentless hacks literally butchering the books kill yourself you should be alright
asoiaf,removed,im guessing you already know about the scene where tyrion is eaten by a dragon that was all over reddit and social media no one saw that coming
asoiaf,removed,my theory is that littlefinger and sansa get married his pet name for her will be winter if you know what im saying
asoiaf,removed,oh wow that is an astonishing find next youre gonna tell us that a song of ice and fire might be an allusion to the wwdragons eh
asoiaf,removed,nobody since this isnt lotr also weve had at least two threads asking that very same question this year alone
asoiaf,removed,he didnt have to write you these books to begin with the story and characters are his you are a customer and claiming you arent acting entitled doesnt make it so go suck your thumb elsewhere
asoiaf,removed,yeah but youre missing the fact he did the hermit thing already and now is old and rich as fuck and now is enjoy the spoils of all his hard work why the fuck would he bother writing any more when he can hire elite vegas prostitutes every day
asoiaf,removed,hello mr masterwritingcraftsman lugonn ser few notes writing is just as much a craft as it is an art there is no reason why martin cant pound out words and do proper outlines is a run on sentence the only thing stopping him is his work ethic and a complete refusal to adapt needs the plural of thing and the plural verb are instead of the singular is this goes for everything in life its not some weird new concept is also a run on sentence thank you for your time you may now return to shitting on grrm for not writing the way that you think he should best
asoiaf,removed,ah nice shitpost
asoiaf,removed,i have no idea how you did that little and winds magic trick when i click the underlined winds it goes nowhere but if i try to copypaste the text i can see your comment about shireen i usually just put spoilers all on everything now because the rules around here are ridiculous
asoiaf,removed,he seems very cynical and unhappy for someone who doesnt have a real job and spends his time touring conventions
asoiaf,removed,im so baked i only realizex youre trolling after this comment thanks that was fun
asoiaf,removed,he does owe us he is our bitch he is too important now to be bothered with autographs and pictures with fans he is hollywood
asoiaf,removed,what is this tmz who cares
asoiaf,removed,its not bullshit the main problem he has based on the meerenese knot is when to introduce characters and events relative to other characters and events a big thing for him to experiment with is for example when the two primary attacks occur during the battle of slavers bay barristans charge and victarions landing do they attack at the same time does barristan attack first and draw ships away from the bay does victarion attack first and allow barristans charge to take the yunkish unawares these three different events can have wildly different effects on characters especially tyrion hes not just following some outline he wrote years ago blindly hes trying to create the most organic compelling story he can i love the fact that these books arent just him following some outline he wrote before he really got into the meat of the story
asoiaf,removed,this is the most bitchy entitled smug and insulting fandom ive ever personally witnessed they treat martin like a slave like he owes them something on their timetable its loathsome if you ask me
asoiaf,removed,im not even grrm and ive grown to hate fans like you just over the course of the past months i cant even imagine how sick he is of hearing spoiled cunts like you constantly giving him shit at this point i would totally understand him releasing twow with the only text in it being fuck you and not releasing the ending
asoiaf,removed,i thank you kindly for your asking and efforts and relaying this information to us good ser at this point in the immortal words of smokey from the movie friday i be like fuck grrm he could have actually transmitted information to us if he was going to take the time to attempt to appear to be transmitting information to us instead we got what i have been saying we have been getting for last last umpteen years the typical gurm answer hahaha aint got shit aint got shit hahaha aint had shit last year aint got shit this year aint gonna have shit next year aint got shit hahahahahahahahha aint got shit imma get up outta here yall stay up hahahahah aint got shit i got money tho money like mayweather money money money aint got shit hahahahahahha respectfully gurm
asoiaf,removed,grrm doesnt care about pleasing his fans he wants to write a good book not please some dipshits who cant wait
asoiaf,removed,so he can insult people no that isnt cool keep it respectful is that so hard
asoiaf,removed,incidentally posting this was an excellent of getting attention for yourself you obviously did it just for the fame because you are successful you wont reply to every comment that is what we get for trusting someone who only cares about fame
asoiaf,removed,that doesnt even make sense if you say that you start a series without the expectation of it being finished youre a liar youre quite the grrm apologist
asoiaf,removed,in the future ill make sure to be only be dickish and condescending to grrm
asoiaf,removed,you kind of said it indirectly by the unnecessary negative and nonconstructive tone in your post that has now been removed it is up to you if you want to stay on this sub i have no authority to tell you otherwise i just wish that you would stop posting hateful nonconstructive shit like you did this time it does not make the books come faster and it creates a negative tone in this sub we are all sick of waiting but there is no reason to act like a spoiled child and ruin the sub for everybody else
asoiaf,removed,no i cant or i should say i am unwilling just delete it you guys need to seriously reevaluate the unnecessary complexity of the rules and the spoiler tags keeping in mind mobile users nobody comes here expecting not to see any spoilers and the frustration of the spoiler tags takes a lot enjoyment out of this sub as does the restriction of indirectly related creative content to mondays or fridays or whatever the current rule is but thats another topic how many comments do mods remove each week because of improper spoiler tags i have to guess its probably in the hundreds
asoiaf,removed,hey while i think this is a good post with a noble goal theres the issue of irl politics in your stannis observation in short to lower the amount of offtopic angry drama in our sub so if you could remove that pointcomparison with hillary thatd be great let me know once you edit and ill reapprove your post
asoiaf,removed,where is the obligatory george please we are now discussing your italics
asoiaf,removed,ctrl f george pls
asoiaf,removed,your mom
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,right with you here ser the tv show has thrown me a bit but i guess without the other targaryen claimant he can be fully supportive of dany
asoiaf,removed,im rather saddened that the intellectual of the asoiaf reddit is preston jacobs
asoiaf,removed,ive always like beric more than stoneheart and richard dormers performance as beric is awesome so showwise ill take him any day and im hoping if the rumors about the wight mission in are true we get to see the hound conquer his fear of fire and him thoros and beric all fight with flaming swords
asoiaf,removed,its cause hes full of shit watch tower tower joy joy and you will never respect his opinions again he makes logical leaps so absurd that they simply cannot be true and then extrapolates on them like they are facts the guy ruined himself for me
asoiaf,removed,than come on you read books you should know the difference
asoiaf,removed,got news for ya autobuddy nothing this poster wrote violates the spoilers asos designation
asoiaf,removed,do you start drinking at noon on your days off
asoiaf,removed,jaime myr myyyyyyyrrr comon myr please myr bronn pretty sure shes dead blood coming out of her eyes and everything
asoiaf,removed,showwise every last generation of great lords have died stark baratheon tully tyrell lannister arryn and martell all lost their lords kinda nutty
asoiaf,removed,jon rose his banners and started a war to prevent ned and robert from dying in kings landing at the hands of royalty ned and robert wouldnt have died in kings landing king aerys was just demanding their heads he didnt care where they died they all died the same year in kings landing ned and robert at the hands of royalty littlefingerjoffrey and lancelthe boar are not royalty you could even make a case against cersei counting as royalty
asoiaf,removed,removed for breaking the httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikicivilitypolicy dont be rude or insulting to users you disagree with
asoiaf,removed,but they didnt ambush them my point is im sure that if they were looking for the hound brother ray would not have given him up thus leading to him being hanged but the hound was pretty much right next to them why didnt they look any further
asoiaf,removed,they mightve targeted the villagers as much as the hound himself perhaps the brotherhood thinks hes a terrible human and they want arya so they think anyone helping and housing the hound is just as terrible as he is perhaps in their minds the villagers are just as bad as sandor for taking him in
asoiaf,removed,this subreddit thrives on negativity even if the claims dont make any sense ie littlefingers teleportation methods
asoiaf,removed,yeah theres definitely a number of cool hints throughout the series there are also some pretty cheap ones as well in davos first chapter in adwd after you meet griff and young griff and right after tyrion suspects who young griff really is but before he announces he knows there are people in a tavern talking about dany and then they start mentioning the other targaryens and then one of them says prince viserys werent the only dragon were he are we sure they killed prince rhaegars son a babe he was i remember thinking that was pretty lame when i read it but there are definitely some cool hints else wise
asoiaf,removed,the waif looks like someone who would have a white and proud neo nazi blog on tumblr
asoiaf,removed,i apologize for the crappy youtube qulaity of the pics
asoiaf,removed,hanging his buddy ray also wasnt necessary when they could have just stabbed him the whole attack was a taunt on the hound
asoiaf,removed,how do you know he meets jon snow the only person who knows he is around is sansaand i also cant see ghost in the pic as for the pic it is in shadows so even sansa would look to have dark hairi would love you to be right because jon meeting littlefinger is something id like to see but only if jon is a wake up to littelfingers machinations so if you can where did you hear about jon meeting baelish
asoiaf,removed,dude you aint even within a mile of freefolk level madness
asoiaf,removed,if syrio comes back i might just start to believe this
asoiaf,removed,wait is the quiet isle in patagonia
asoiaf,removed,you spelled it everthing see user
asoiaf,removed,i hope jon has to eventually deal with lsh zombiebowl hype
asoiaf,removed,so when yara said that she was gonna fuck the tits off this one it was actually brilliant foreshadowing theons gonna try to tittyfuck a prostitute with his fancy new volcano cock but her breasts will immediately burn to a crisp and literally crumble off of her torso
asoiaf,removed,what is dead may never die but rise again with hot viscous fluid spurting from the tip
asoiaf,removed,hi this has been removed in keeping with rule on memes and silly content you are welcome to post it in our motley monday thread
asoiaf,removed,a lot of people knew the battle of the bastards was going to happen in episode since november
asoiaf,removed,sounds like your wife is cheating on you and thinking about other men when having conversations with you id divorce her immediately
asoiaf,removed,hi this has been removed in keeping with rule on memes and silly content
asoiaf,removed,you mean take personal responsibility and avoid discussions outside the scope you are comfortable with that will never work
asoiaf,removed,i agree i just think that line wasnt needed at all they couldve brought up aegon and such but having them doubt whether he was even killed seemed a silly thing to talk about years after his death
asoiaf,removed,but umcallisterco makes a good point in the words of gandhi be the change you want to be in the world if people want more nonspoilers everything posts create some otherwise stick to the posts with the level they are comfortable with and quit bitching endlessly about the spoiler system which is in place to protect your spoilerphobic sensibilities by clearly marking the threads where spoilers are given freedom to roam how did we get from i dont want to be spoiled posts should be marked so i know which threads are safe to im upset because people arent making posts at the level i personally prefer i mean wtf the first is reasonable the second is childish
asoiaf,removed,that depends on what the definition of is is bill clinton
asoiaf,removed,have you seen the show or read the question
asoiaf,removed,im sorry to not only comment on the topic and yes youre probably right but your post is kind of insulting grasp it fully before no you are not the one who can judge if i grasped a topic fully or not and no you will not end a discussion or a certain opinion about something once and for all that kind of aggressive posts or comments is poison for a discussion board
asoiaf,removed,some of the negativity is hilarious though because its so transparent that the negative posters really want to participate but cant find anything meaningful to say so they stoop down to the lowest common denominator type behavior in other words theyre attention whores that need to be ignored
asoiaf,removed,hes going to punch him until hes about to die then imprison him hes not going to kill him
asoiaf,removed,i just read some leaked with a highly reliable source i think you may be right lol
asoiaf,removed,we do not kill our guests mayhaps
asoiaf,removed,ive read complaints about the fact that they have potatoes in westeros because potatoes originated in peru well thats neat to know that peru apparently exists on the same planet as westeros and there is no way for potatoes in a completely fictional world to grow in an area based largely on europe lets also ignore the fact that while potatoes may not be european they grow quite well here wich is why they became so common bitching about potatoes in a world with giant wolves dragons ice zombies and coming back from the dead nice
asoiaf,removed,i tried to read them separately half a dozen times and just couldnt get through it i used the new reader order and if you dig around google enough theres an ebook thats got it all in order so you dont have to switch from book to book constantly and feastdance are so much more digestible still not in love with some storylines i practically skimmed the tyrion and half of the dany chapters but its way easier to get through on a reread when youre not trying to get through the plot its easier to do the books separately take in the writing style and the meandering travelogues but on a first read or if youre just trying to casually reread something you enjoy combined order
asoiaf,removed,mace is donald trump confirmed
asoiaf,removed,you have some freedom dothraki you have some freedom dothraki everyone is behind dany tarbushyan because she is there to find the white walkers of mass destruction enter contractors to pillage oil gold and other resources bam hsis is formed high sparrow in stormlands drogone strikes persist for the next years then dealmaker littlefinger trump is elected president and makes a deal yuuuuuge deal end story
asoiaf,removed,no i didnt miss the point go read the twow and tell me its not a caricature nice try but it failed simple as cause everything in the text supports danys perception its poor writing with missed opportunity just cause you like it doesnt mean what i said was wrong
asoiaf,removed,that was almost certainly jaqen
asoiaf,removed,yep he paid them with a dragon egg methinks
asoiaf,removed,i thought by this point we all accepted that it was a faceless man paid by euron who killed balon coz its pretty convenient that euron just randomly appears out of nowhere after balon is dead he killed all of the greyjoy brothers as he admits to aeron in forsaken he says he threw a dragon egg in a fit of rage which makes no sense its a dragon egg one of the most valuable items of planetos and as you pointed out i dreamt of a man without a face waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung on his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings i see no reason to doubt that theory
asoiaf,removed,no we dont we hate crazy bitches like cersei the conservatives that you femanazis villiafy actually prefer strong women our women are able to stand up for themselves hunt fish shoot a gun raise a family take care of a home and if they want have their own careers
asoiaf,removed,f the show i hate it it is awful and i refuse to acknowledge it on a subreddit intended for the books get out
asoiaf,removed,get over if
asoiaf,removed,fat pink mast
asoiaf,removed,george pls by uasoiafblackfyre coffeeonmyscreenlevel of funny hope it was in though reddit says year ago
asoiaf,removed,grrm will be dead before the series is done
asoiaf,removed,lmao youre imagining things she mouths his name is and then it cuts away theres not some secret audio hidden those are just recordings with audio imperfections that youre imagining have meanings
asoiaf,removed,i feel so sad that you dont think the tv show will essentially be the same thing i hope you slowly come to grips with it before you read a book and have your heart ripped out all at once
asoiaf,removed,reek reek it rhymes with leak leak of wild cards hbo series confirmed
asoiaf,removed,im finally now that you mention it triggered when i check this subject everyday waiting for any sign of the release of twowi know it doesnt matter to anyone else but no more excuses reallyfuck grrmhes obviously doesnt give a shit about the fans of his workhe doesnt even update us on his progressfuck him and this series
asoiaf,removed,i know youre just trying to be edgy but thats why it makes it even more profoundly stupid that your edgy comment is markedly wrong
asoiaf,removed,fucking lol at bedunk hahahahahaha
asoiaf,removed,do you have access to kodi by any chance i find the exodus add on perfect for what you are looking for
asoiaf,removed,it exists but good luck finding it i used a few for my transcript
asoiaf,removed,i know grrm does a lot of set up and youd think people would see that by now since people complain more about the fake deaths than the resurrections why dont you explain what the great artistic purpose is of brienne fakedying twice davos twice arya twice mance sandor aegon joncon tyrion twice theon bran rickon ramsay and asha all is its absolutely fucking excessive and reeks of shitty soap opera writing we arent done with the series yet yes we are i no longer have any faith that martin will release twow even if he does he will never finish the series twow was supposed to be act ii of iii instead books and years later weve not even finished act as all the nonjon climaxes of affcadwd have been pushed back the series is done if martin were any more lost in a dark wood virgil would show up to take him through the circles of hell the best and biggest moments have yet to happen theres no objective reason to believe that
asoiaf,removed,wellis he we dont actually know if he is fine just that he hasnt shown any symptoms yet christ youre reaching did it say the blade hit her in the back of the head no nor does it need to the hound striking a preteen girl in the back of the head with a blunt object with sufficient force to knock her out would almost certainly be fatal in anything outside of a steven seagal film but muh grrm loves gritty realism right thats all you need to think about before you realize shes not dead why would the lannisters execute ned when they said they wouldnt and its obviously not in their interests thats all you need to think about before you realise hes not dead of course hes coming back but he actually did die that doesnt fit the definition of a fake death of course it does as the critical aspect of death is that the person is and remains dead gandalf actually died too semantics i mean he left the clue there for you she screamed sword try not being a smug asshole maybe
asoiaf,removed,but thats the thing he did kill jon snow so what people technically actually die all the time on dbz doesnt actually matter one bit when they just come back in the next chapter anyways hes already commented on how the characters that come back to life arent the same characters anymore hes also already commented that the books would be a trilogy that he could get the next book out by and that he disliked how tolkien brought gandalf back and didnt talk about aragorns tax policies and yet hes never talked about tax policies and brought back characters from deaths real and fake no more changed than gandalf was ill even say that thematically affc and adwd is stronger than the first books even if this were true which i think youd have to be a lobotomised doofus to honestly believe its almost without any value as a piece of writing can have very strong thematic elements and still be a steaming piece of shit theres a lazy fake death every other chapter the prose lapses into selfparody the characters become caricatures of themselves every other phrase is a fucking memetic martinism the pacing is offensive to humanity and the editing is nonexistent by martins diktat adwd is outside the theon chapters one of the single worst pieces of fiction ever published by anyone is history
asoiaf,removed,lol
asoiaf,removed,haha okay buddy whatever you say rolls eyes
asoiaf,removed,you really want me to waste my time presenting you all the evidence cause there is a mountain of it wights attack the fist multiple characters say they see wights first hand and white walkers first hand at this fight immediately after fleeing this battle of wights samwell tarly kills a white walker do you think the walkers were just chilling hey look at all those dead guys fighting the nights watch who are completely unrelated to us lets go help them out cause reasons in that darkness the others came for the first time she said as her needles went click click click they were cold things dead things that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun and every creature with hot blood in its veins they swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms felled heroes and armies by the score riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain youd best pray its a wildling blade that kills me though the ones the others kill dont stay dead and they remember alliser thorne monsters they may be but they were men before they died how much remains the one i slew was intent on killing lord commander mormont plainly he remembered who he was and where to find him my lord father used to tell me that a man must know his enemies we understand little of the wights and less about the others we need to learn jon snow a man can fight the dead but when their masters come when the white mists rise up how do you fights a mist crow shadows with teeth air so cold it hurts to breathe like a knife inside your chest you do not know you cannot know can your sword cut cold melisandre necromancy animates these wights yet they are still only dead flesh steel and fire will serve for them the ones you call the others are something more man just forget it this is stupid im not going to keep flipping through pages of the books to prove you wrong youre wrong i know youre wrong you know youre wrong ever poster in here knows youre wrong and in two years when that bot reminds me and we finally have another book ill come back here and remind you that you were wrong good day

asoiaf,removed,brandon has no one to blame for his death but himself going to the crown and demanding the crown prince come out to die was idiotic dont understand that logic this would have never happened if lyanna didnt go full retard she obviously deserves part of the blame
asoiaf,removed,wow youre jumping to a lot of conclusions i dont know where to begin moreover why shouldnt we feel sorry for her assuming she was kidnapped then shes a moron who played a part in starting the biggest civil war ever why would i feel sorry for her but you know who went along with it and perhaps even encouraged it rhaegar the adult the adult crown prince who was married with children either rhaegar made the decision knowing full well what sort of shitstorm would occur and didnt care or he made the decision completely ignorant of the consequences yeah right youre talking like i claimed i feel sorry for rhaegar or something he was an idiot like lyanna as well and i dont feel sorry for him either in fact i was very happy when robert smashed a warhammer through his choice again assuming she wasnt kidnapped it was a person decision they are both to blame not to mention the completely insane response of aeryss killing a lord paramount and his heir then demanding that another two lord paramounts be turned over to him ill give rhaegar this i dont think even he could have seen that coming which all goes back to lyanna going full retard if she wasnt kidnapped hence why i dont feel sorry for her pregnant at which is just what every teenaged girl wants if she wasnt raped and it was consensual sex then thats her fault what choices do you think she had in between running away and dying assuming she wasnt kidnapped then maybe not going with rhaegar in the first place strange how people can feel sorry for robb jaime theon even rhaegar but not lyanna seems a little off base to me i dont feel sorry for any of them you want to know who i feel bad for ned starks dad he had a retarded daughter who left with the crown prince once again assuming no kidnapping and a retarded son who tried to square up with the prince in kings landing i will say this strong username to your lyanna defense post
asoiaf,removed,whats with throwing the word retarded around does having mental disabilities stupid or is that just what you call all stupid people the latter why does that bother you i dont think im going to get into matters of consent with you its absurd imo to believe that she can give informed consent to an older guy that has her holed up in a tower in a foreign land with no obligation to her or her family isolation is an abuse tactic after all and how did she end up in that isolated tower because she most likeily thought he was hot and wanted to get in his pants her being has nothing to do with it any year old should have enough common sense to see why that was a bad idea stop trying to take away all blame from lyanna and mindlessly pin it all on rhaegar they are both equally to blame those two along with aerys are responsible for thousands of deaths deal with it lyanna is not this innocent angel that you have tricked yourself into believing im certain he expected a response from house stark but i dont think anyone saw brandons actions coming nobody saw that an older brother would be furious that his sister disappeared lyanna is a defensible character no shes a moronic and selfish women who personally let her feelings for her man crush monday cause thousands of innocent and good people to die because she was thirsty for some dragon d
asoiaf,removed,is so hilarious when you take into account that she was about to be married off to a pretty hot guy and oh what was her issue with him infidelity so its okay if rhaegar does it but not robert somethings missing here and i bet that missing piece is a raging sexual attraction rhaegar was described as a appearance wise so yes i can see lyanna being so attracted to him that she would run off with him the equally to blame part is what i have qualms with putting lyanna on the same scale as rhaegar means you are being willfully ignorant of the circumstances the onus to not have sex with a teenager was on rhaegar whats wrong with having sex with a year old girl she was born in and the war started in why are you using real life standards in a medieval setting they are both adults under westeros law therefore its both equally their fault lyanna could not force him to do either of those things if she could then yes id say the blame is equal sure she can by not leaving with him in the first place making the case that rhaegar was plain dumb or lovestruck falls through at the slightest bit of scrutiny i have never once defended rhaegar i am not making any case for him i gotta say brandons actions were definitely a first storming the red keep and demanding the crown prince to come out and die yeah something tells me thats not terribly predictable why is that if someone steals a member of a liege lords family that family will retaliate no one was surprised when tywin started world war when tyrion was kidnapped this is reductive and gross she was he was this all happened because of one girls hormones so much for equally sharing the blame shes thats legal adult age once again stop using the laws of today to make judgement in medivial times there is nothing gross about marrying a year old in westeros this all happened because of one girls hormones so much for equally sharing the blame because lyanna is the only one youre defending so thats who i am discussing why would i keep bringing up rhaegar i said theyre both equally to blame do i need to constantly repeat that if i ever say anything bad about lyanna it should go without saying
asoiaf,removed,so was robert rhaegar and robert are not in the same league its hilarious how you deny book canon to support your pathetic arguments cersei said even jaime whos considered a god by brienne is nothing to rhaegar therefore rhaegar was much better looking than robert so youre wrong jon was born in lyanna was when she died it was early when she was kidnapped unless youre saying she was for over a year that doesnt add up this is based off the speculative timeline as for using reallife standards grrm has girls starting from the age of getting married off to older men this is not normal for a medieval setting medievalists will tell you this wikipedia will tell you this was not the average age for marriage in medieval europe was definitely not the average age for childbirth either you have accepted a fictional worlds morality as your own or you have fallen into the historical accuracy trap the first one is gross the second is forgivable there is nothing wrong with having sex with a year old in westeros if there is give an argument from the series that supports this otherwise stop embarrassing yourself there is no precedent for what brandon did none zero zilch nada he didnt show up with an army he showed up with like four people that doesnt scream well organized plan of attack to me you dont have enough common sense to not realize someone in a high born family is going to do something when a member in their family disappears i can see why you like lyanna so much then you guys have a similar level of iq
asoiaf,removed,and again you are avoiding the question i asked what choice she had between running away and dying not how could this all be prevented you also didnt provide a response to my statement that lyanna could not force rhaegar to have sex with her or run away with her you just said she could not not force him to run away with her by not running away at all definitely not the same thing you mean not putting yourself in a situation is not a perfectly good solution to a problem well colour me surprised
asoiaf,removed,anyways its midnight tired af and going to sleep we can continue this if you really want to next time i log on in a few days i guess
asoiaf,removed,hes got a yuuuuge plan to make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,idk even ned had to admit that robert was pretty damn fine in his youth even cersei who hated him granted him that and you saw cerseis quote about rhaegar which should make it clear that rhaegar is way more attractive then him im pretty sure the argument was him running away with him because hes the best looking dude in the land has the highest status in the land and she cries when he plays the harp all factors theres no evidence for her being taken against her will tbh if thats what you want to argue wtf it was you who brought up the medieval times argument yes and now i changed my argument because you brought up a good point is that not allowed you dont live in westeros dude but rhaegar does so yes just like all those previous examples its dumb to judge him for that the problem isnt you just judging him its you also trying to make him take more blame for this then her using his age as an argument is wrong because its allowed in his universe youre letting your bias for lyanna make you not look at this logically and fairly they both deserve equal blame rhaegar being a few years older is not relevant in all honesty that was my point theyre both equally guilty of being retarded
asoiaf,removed,jaimes gonna learn about rlj and bends a knee to jon and makes him take the iron throne s script leak says hes gonna head north in the end of in the show
asoiaf,removed,even as thinly veiled as this is symbolism is completely lost on you
asoiaf,removed,it took me seconds to find you telling someone else the right viewpoint seriously all four episodes so far have been great do people not remember how fucking boring season was for the most part now youre pretending like there isnt a difference between good and bad story telling you dont believe this shit and have never acted this way when you espouse your analysis its just a convenient way for you to justify your like of awful story telling the only reason you reacted that way was because someone criticized your deity you have no actual intellectual objection to the concept of good and bad writing youre a cult member that gets offended and feels the need to defend your adopted deity at every turn
asoiaf,removed,i know something all ill say is the following lets revisit your opinion and this post after episode airs the battle lines for the conclusion will be clear

asoiaf,removed,drink from my cum chalice cumdumpster
asoiaf,removed,randall tarly will probably keep the loss of the house sword quiet but i think he and his other son will at least try to go after it hard to say what sams end goal is other than fuck you dad
asoiaf,removed,theres very little reason to believe anything that anyone says and you are a retard if you feel betrayed by someone telling you that something doesnt happen and then it does stop taking everything as certain you dumbfucks
asoiaf,removed,wow absolutely beautiful fuck you sam for stealing this shit if i were randyll id be pissed
asoiaf,removed,sam was first against the white walkers
asoiaf,removed,dont lose that thing sam
asoiaf,removed,i always wondered if heartsbane was actually lightbringer since it was tempered in nissa nissas heart her hearts bane sam stealing it would be a cool way for it to get to jon so he could thwn turn on its heatmaking flamespouting powers not that i think thats likely at all but this sword would like badass glowing red in the bastards hands
asoiaf,removed,hes on his way to citadel presumably to uncover a secret i cant think of a more gamechanging secret
asoiaf,removed,it has to be something to do with the white walkers valyrian steel is the only known substance besides obsidian that kills them idk if he can reverse engineer it seeing as valyrian steels forging heavily involved magic and dragon fire but maybe sam thinks that he can figure out what exactly in the steel makes them effective in that regard if sam does continue on to oldtown itll be interesting to see if the maesters would be willing to offer him protection from his father because of the importance of his task
asoiaf,removed,the real comment right here
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,so youre telling me maesters read every single bookscroll in their library and there isnt anything left in there to uncover whys sam going there then
asoiaf,removed,to learn from maesters who already know everything theres to be known basically you guys are suggesting sams not going to achieve anything extraordinary hes going to spend a decade there forge his chain and become a maester when westeros is nothing but a ruin
asoiaf,removed,i like there house words because it makes an awesome show only scene have even more depth when robert is talking with selmy about the first person he ever killed it was a highborn tarly boy robert talks about how if he had lingered on the edge of the battlefield he would probably would still be alive and would have bent the knee like all the other lords but he didnt linger because tarlys are first in battle
asoiaf,removed,they all tried before tge dragons came back
asoiaf,removed,bran said he wouldnt ride a horse again till tyrion showed up to give him a bichin saddle yeah i know it was never actually made but whatever
asoiaf,removed,i bet randyll tarly is voting for trump
asoiaf,removed,yeah episode called cripples bastards and broken things episodes when he first meets osha hope ive spelt that right
asoiaf,removed,yeah really comes across like a pissed of autistic
asoiaf,removed,yes but who cares about themsams journey has to have a purpose apart from us visting the reach and oldtownthe endgame of having the dragons show up to burn ww is a bit too simplistic for a writer like grrmit is a song of ice and firedany has dragonsjon will hopefully have valyrian steel and knowlwdge about how to finish off ww courtesy of knowledge provided by sam the slayer
asoiaf,removed,keep us posted
asoiaf,removed,at best grrm will die before he writes it at worst
asoiaf,removed,and i was sincere when i mocked you for your offtopic he for years wants to do all other different stuff i would consider him an idiot and unimaginative person if that wasnt the case stuff that he wrote for world of ice and fire and few short stories are great and zealous an he wrote alot
asoiaf,removed,better luck next time kid
asoiaf,removed,lolo your humor is so creative thanks for sharing
asoiaf,removed,thanks for warning about spoilers for non comic book readers fucking asshole
asoiaf,removed,there were spoilers posted a while back that rickon will die in jons arms
asoiaf,removed,see even the mods think youre awful
asoiaf,removed,jesus this joke is so old and unfunny
asoiaf,removed,i agree with most of what you say here as i much as i want a cleganebowl i dont think it will happen i made a post on rgameofthrones which didnt get any traction anyways im betting tommens allegiance with the hs will directly or indirectly cause something tragic to tommen and hell commit suicide i was thinking maybe a death of someone close to him but maybe as you allude here tommen will find out hes a bastard and a product of incest
asoiaf,removed,oh yea forgot i was on rwalkingdead
asoiaf,removed,the only reason he might likely will die before finishing the series is because of his own glacial writing pace im not talking about his weight or anything else hes and the average american male lifespan is approximately years i dont think he will finish twow and the next book in years and he will certainly not finish if the series is expanded to books instead of
asoiaf,removed,ramsay kills wun wun with one arrow thats so gay
asoiaf,removed,every single person in this thread is like
asoiaf,removed,then euron runs on a make westeros great again platform to become king he wins while everyone is too busy moaning about how dany used dragon delegates to beat jon snow
asoiaf,removed,topics containing previews of new shows or books need to be tagged extended or above we are also looking into these as they may need to be under production if they didnt air officially
asoiaf,removed,please stop posting these images at this time
asoiaf,removed,nsfw that shit cmon im all for spoilers but many may not be
asoiaf,removed,mayhaps you should nsfw spoiler tag these bro
asoiaf,removed,or jon could be talking to that newvredhead karstark girl she could be pleading with him leading up that high stakes scene later in in ep all these clips could be from ep aryas first scene is arriving at winterfell i mea yes please
asoiaf,removed,yeah alys karstark would never wear furs no way its not like she comes from an important noble house
asoiaf,removed,holy shit that may be the dumbest thing ive ever read on reddit
asoiaf,removed,fuck em up
asoiaf,removed,yeah sarcasm and calling everyone retards are totally the same thing
asoiaf,removed,has had red wedding quantities of death and general all round bad news and grrm has just roosed boltoned us and plunged the last dagger into our hearts
asoiaf,removed,waithes going to mexico pls dont get killed mr grrm wait dont go mr grrm trump will box you in hell build a wall while you drink tequillas noo dont go pls we want winds
asoiaf,removed,hopefully theres at least one certain reality tv star will die
asoiaf,removed,lets keep in mind that it took that cunt jk rowling years to write the whole harry potter series game of thrones came out years before philosophers stone and shes got two books on him i know he might have more pages i just like to vent
asoiaf,removed,fat old man shouldnt be drinking tequila dont do anything to put your health on the line george we need you to live
asoiaf,removed,hes been cutting back on other commitments for years now and yet he keeps going to cons editing other books etc the man clearly has no discipline andor morale and is in a downward spiral it must hurt like hell to know that some douchebags are going to get to finish your magnum opus before you do and steal all your thunder
asoiaf,removed,how how would getting an updated computer improve his productivity
asoiaf,removed,would you have remember martin signed away the rights in he was two years into dance and at the time thought hed be finished within a year so he was expecting to be done with dance before the show aired and then seven seasons of the show to finish winds and start on dream even if every book took him years his longest break at the time hed have been finished only forcing a year hiatus on the shows part it was a realistic almost easy goal at the time then everything went to shit
asoiaf,removed,ive already come to accept that he will die before finishing the series
asoiaf,removed,lol fuck him
asoiaf,removed,he is our fat little piggy and he should squell when we demand so we have been paying for his shit so much and the transaction feels very onesided
asoiaf,removed,seriously george you dont have any trouble writing words about fucking football do ya huh
asoiaf,removed,hes a fucking fraud fan too a fan of both the giants and the jets get the fuck out of here with that weak shit
asoiaf,removed,keep blowing him
asoiaf,removed,those improve productivity for people who use them the fact that martin still uses a brick should tell you he wont use them meaning that upgrading bis brick wont do anything
asoiaf,removed,oh god dude listen what i mean is that if it is the case that he really is no longer writing he shouldnt wait with telling us about it and here i thought at first i might have been condescending to you i meant people like you with no reading skills
asoiaf,removed,now now dont be so bitter why dont you go over to rwholesomememes for a few minutes and come back when youre all positively charged again ready to seize the day
asoiaf,removed,to be fair i did misread the word updates for cutting the crusts off of my sandwiches i am a pretty poor reader in that regard
asoiaf,removed,i mean its just elio and linda who handle his twitter does anyone still like them
asoiaf,removed,yes because he hasnt left his house in thirty years he has no idea what copypaste is
asoiaf,removed,literally anywhere he walks he will be surrounded by people who gave him money based on the first few books i thought he was going to be the closest thing we were ever going to get to get fantasy on the quality level of mark twain or fucking tolstoy instead we get this fat bastard holding out not finishing up this ridiculous convoluted mess he caused hes not just my bitch hes our bitch and he owes us an ending before he keels over we all have a right to complain just mention that he and everyone in your line of site has paid him for the right to bitch
asoiaf,removed,fuck grrm and his leadfilled ass he can rot in his dim mini mansion on top of his pile of cash and depends
asoiaf,removed,bingo bango bongo
asoiaf,removed,i dont understand this mentality the ironborn arent intruding on your work theyre an intrinsic part of the story whos role in the plot was gradually built up from book of course theyre overall my favorite faction and have my favorite conflict so im biased but god do people really not want new plot points to be introduced simple they are boring theon is the most interesting one by a long shot if you cant make something interesting you shouldnt write it in that simple stop acting like it was irrelevant scraps that should have been cut just because you dont enjoy it i despise the lack of critical thinking you illustrate here it shouldve been scrapped because it contributes to the ridiculous story bloat weve experienced
asoiaf,removed,serious question how much longer do people seriously think an obese nerd like grrm has left to live its going to take the lions share of a decade if not more for ados to come out there certainly is some chance that hell live that long but in general fat fucks arent known for their longevity it will never come out its really too bad i loved the ip ill just have to content myself with the diet version on the show im not going to wait for years after the show ended to read the book grrm you played yourself you soiled your legacy through a combination of greed for that sweet sweet tv money and your incorrigible laziness
asoiaf,removed,release the forsaken chapter analysis video already smh
asoiaf,removed,grrm was a very popular writer before the show was even thought of why do you think he was approached to make the show in the first place god you people are so delusional
asoiaf,removed,please read the comments after he litterally didnt understand it even after this he was just being a pain in the ass for no reason i think i can say people like you about that
asoiaf,removed,with this post
asoiaf,removed,im expecting it to be a lot like a storm of swords in terms of delivering a series of major climaxes that have been set up in the previous two books details and outcomes of the trials of cersei and margaery the battles of the crofters village and winterfell the denouements of the pink letter the hooded man mances schemes and the gnc the battle of fire the taking of storms end and probably kings landing the reveal of eurons master plan the resurrection of jon either the departure of dany her newly expanded army or perhaps even their first battles in westeros the denouements of the various riverlands dramas and mysteries likely another bloody wedding of one color or the other something big with sansa perhaps kidnapped perhaps becoming a power player the return of arya probably the first contact of the others with southofthewall westeros various reveals regarding marwyn and quaithe in essos its gonna be one huge revelation after the next
asoiaf,removed,i dont understand and definitely dont like your tone grrm has no need of your ironic comments and very stupid at that as well i have news for you even if he delivered twow new years eve the show would still spoil the end if the show was about to end and not get delayed waiting for cannon material then this was bound to happen did i forget to say go fuk urself take your irony and gtfo
asoiaf,removed,jesus a giant disclaimer with a quote of him saying that should be on the cover of all his books throw up a picture of him too so everyone can see how uh unhealthy he is
asoiaf,removed,ever since undead benjen said the children brought him back to life with dragonglass ive assumed there had to be a whole bunch more of these undead nights watch out there the children could have easily done that to the last heros bros as well
asoiaf,removed,lend me the last couple of books
asoiaf,removed,george plz

asoiaf,removed,damn dude the auto mods are really on your case
asoiaf,removed,sjws have invaded westeros
asoiaf,removed,well you got it but in the process have been incredibly rude
asoiaf,removed,still being kinda rude there buddy thats not what fanfiction is i think you are mainly cherry picking theories you dont like or dont line up with your view of asoiaf and calling them fanfiction i think you genuinely need to read more of martins work literature is a subjective and interpretive medium and understanding how the author structures his stories can only help you to understand the work the idea that there is one objective way to understand the story your way and every theory that doesnt line up with that is fanfiction is incredibly arrogant reading martins other work could open up a totally new paradigm for you so im confused why you arent open to that and would prefer to insult theories that dont like up with how you understand the text
asoiaf,removed,im sorry was arthur dayne supposed to be a twinkletoed pansysniffer
asoiaf,removed,its not about honour its about winning so spoketh trump
asoiaf,removed,who the fuck are elio and linda and why should i give a fuck what they think
asoiaf,removed,ive been asking the same questions about lets plays for their entire existence
asoiaf,removed,the show is an adaptation i just enjoy it for what it is i would have liked to have seen tom bombadil in the lotr movies but thats the way she goes just think of it as a separate version of the same story and youll have a better time yeah i got this probably before you even found this sub be less condescending i personally loved hardhome it is arguably one of the best episodes of the series imdb so if you cant enjoy that episode maybe it just isnt for you because a bunch of people raised on michael bay movies liked something isnt exactly a brilliant defense of writing and substance
asoiaf,removed,so if you cant enjoy that episode maybe it just isnt for you you may no argument besides my taste is superior to yours and you want to act like i am rude
asoiaf,removed,how many leather bound books do you have does your apartment smell of rich mahogany
asoiaf,removed,im not sure if you didnt read are being intentionally obtuse or are just really dense but obviously this conversation is going nowhere
asoiaf,removed,remind me who you are and why i care what you think lmao
asoiaf,removed,you read books and talk about how well read you arelet me revise my answer youre so right its far too beneath someone of your superior intellect since youll be waiting awhile for twow i recommend trying the varieties of religious experience by william james maybe some platos republic and maybe some english history books that should hold you overor maybe not youre well read so youve probably read all that all ready
asoiaf,removed,wheres the insult or attack he said himself hes well read i offered some suggestions but i suppose if youre well read then maybe youve already read it theres not a single insult or attack in there weird that someone would take offense to it
asoiaf,removed,you posted this thread asking for everybodys opinion whether or not you should pick up watching the show again all youve done is push back on the responses you have asked for so im convinced you came here looking to argue nobody gives a shit if you watch the show theres no reason to come here and bitch about it
asoiaf,removed,that head was so fucking small man no fucking way shaggydog is fine nigga
asoiaf,removed,am i not in a sub for discussing asoiaf am i obligated to bow and scrape in order to get your prophetic opinions hes not saying you have to agree with people but the way you write things and go about arguing makes a lot of people lose interest in the actual argument really where is this argument articulated in anyway i believe you would get much more informed responses if you treated people a little nicer that is a nice assertion any proof for it
asoiaf,removed,blaming the mirror because you dont like the reflection is not the way to go dont speak to me as if i am a child i am well aware that i phrased my questions in such a way as to challenge the gospel in this sub hardholme is the greatest episode ever in a provocative way that was intentionally to get over the constant circle jerking you get for it on this sub mostly from more recent arrivals honestly i miss when this sub was niche and a person with a nuanced opinion could do what i wanted without being provocative however if i had been milquetoast with my post it never would have made the top and would have been ignored you have much larger problems in this sub than long term members losing a bit of civility with teenagers maybe focus on getting the tmz style updates and dae think the last episode xxx posts to stop dominating the front page as that clearly speaks to the quality of the users here this used to be westerosorgs reddit outpost now it is rgameofthrones with a cuntier attitude
asoiaf,removed,explain how an episode that doesnt move the plot forward necessarily harms the narrative the entire battle the show runners face is how to squeeze thousands of pages of text into episodes do i need to elaborate what are you opinions on affcadwd chapters that dont move the narrative along they do in nuanced ways for characters that matter the entire faith storyline comes from those it matters the majority of jon as lc happens in those that matters jon going michael bay hero against the ice zombie king for minutes then the rest of the nw forgetting that fact immediately doesnt
asoiaf,removed,dont kid yourself they removed mine and yours but you are still an asshole
asoiaf,removed,yes it does put it back
asoiaf,removed,guys like you are absolutely insufferable
asoiaf,removed,lol brandon sanderson writing asoiaf are you high or just stupid sandersons religious sensibilities cant handle asoiaf
asoiaf,removed,ramsay is gonna cut that lil niggas feet off
asoiaf,removed,bro i dont want to do this to you in case you know youre dog just died or you had to put her mom in a home maybe a tricky divorce cause shes sleeping with her brother i dunnobut eddard left the trident and went to kings landing in roberts place since he was wounded he found jaime lannister on the throne robert showed up later and the dead royals are presented to him which causes the falling out between eddard and robert eddard then goes south to storms end and lifts the siege once more due to robert being wounded and then goes to the toj with his best mates the show isnt the books im not saying eddard did use ice at the toj but it makes sense he did as he was not planning to return to kings landing due to his fall out with robert so he wouldnt have left ice there unless robert was a douche and didnt let him have it back until the reconciled i dont mean to be an ass but
asoiaf,removed,hurrrrrrr durrrrrrrr
asoiaf,removed,i thought that it looked like older style armor like from an movie or something almost robocoplike lol and i think intentionally so were supposed to think that this happened years ago thats kind of how movie armor looked years ago i believe it subconsciously cues the viewer in that this isnt a modern vision this is a previous era of vision
asoiaf,removed,cant help it its a natural reaction to seeing something so stupid that it doesnt deserve a response via real words
asoiaf,removed,jesus h she was just hitting her with a kendo stick people have gone mad on this sub
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,leaked filming spoilers have rickon being shot in the legs before the battle
asoiaf,removed,dude seriously i like to talk about what might happen and speculate on ideas comments that spoil unreleased content take that away from me fuck people like that guy
asoiaf,removed,delusional harsh unless you looked up the actor from the most recent episode and the last one with rickon itd be entirely reasonable to suppose that its someone pretending to be rickon
asoiaf,removed,tell that to people who insult martin all i see here is people bashing and trashing martin i didnt see anyone defending him when i see a man acting like a child and he insults someone for stupid reasons i call them out im frustrated too that the book isnt out yet i dont call him lazy or a joke because he hasnt finished it yet i accept that its difficult to write a book that big while trying to tie all the loose ends together other people dont understand that or simply dont care and want the book out now isnt that childish
asoiaf,removed,ugh dude keep your political views out of this sub please the front page has more than enough political talk for it to have any need to spill over here its completely irrelevant to the conversation and just seems like a cheap ploy to get some upvotes from both trump and bernie supporters give me a break
asoiaf,removed,the last time id seen the actor was years ago so i and i imagine many other people needed a side by side comparison

asoiaf,removed,holy shitpost
asoiaf,removed,sorry mate it got deleted i can still send you the info if you want
asoiaf,removed,whats that nerds on reddit are applying an unfair doublestandard towards female fantasy characters thats insane stop killing our freedom of speech
asoiaf,removed,some couchtuner comment said he was gonna die so i was really scared
asoiaf,removed,oh so much to say so much to say
asoiaf,removed,her character development so far shows that she has failed to be anything like littlefinger would still lose ricken but sansa could have at least told him why ramsey is not to be trusted doesnt really give any details about his cruelness jon has a fucking wildling army and a giant you telling me she cant trust jon for real if a nigga got a mythical giant at his side you better believe the other shit he said is true jon never knew the vale was coming thus could had anticipated less casualties if he did know still could have had an element of surprise ie flanking the enemy that was not the best way to win the battle clearly because jon almost died many times not even going to give a legit comment about that she never knew about ned stark and littlefingers betrayal so dont bullshit on that one otherwise she wouldnt have trusted him to begin with
asoiaf,removed,hitler killed because he too wished to ensure a stable world for the german people he honestly believed that jews blacks homosexuals russians communists disabled people and all other deviants were a plague to humanity that needed to be purged in order to entire a golden age of humanity and the thousand year reich tywin ordered the mountain to rape pillage and burn the riverlands to the ground because tyrion was taken
asoiaf,removed,the act of writing helps you remember your notes having a computer in class can be a distraction i would suggest avoiding it where possible
asoiaf,removed,first id be willing to bet of stannis fans liked book stannis not show stannis second im not sure how saving the day at the wall is comparable to not telling jon that sansa had requested reinforcements what do you see wrong with stannis actions at the battle of the wall im also not sure how the battle of the blackwater is relevant at all it wasnt exactly a deliberate suicide attack third i dont think anybody defending him after he burned shireen and i also think plenty people took issue with him murdering renly are you dead serious with this comparison i barely see the connection
asoiaf,removed,varys has a secret mission
asoiaf,removed,mneckbeard
asoiaf,removed,to be fair very few people were excited about aerons story until the new chapter was released
asoiaf,removed,okay thanks for the downvotes cunt
asoiaf,removed,i didnt fawn over stannis in fact i mentioned him specifically because he is a divisive character and because he and dany share a common justification for leadership the line of succession points to me i also mentioned balon but since that didnt fit your this guy is probably voting for trump narrative i guess you glossed over that part
asoiaf,removed,shit nigga u right
asoiaf,removed,your cynicism bores us just stop watching
asoiaf,removed,exactly the broad strokes of his story not the details im not talking about the broad strokes of the battle in the episode im talking about multiple very specific events all piling up kind of like the wall of bodies at the battle one or two isnt a big deal after a while they build up and form a wall you cant miss oh for christs sake we know he was the marshal of france we know he was involved in either the first or second charge mounted or dismounted but his title probably means the former we know the features of the terrain at the time of battle we know the anticavalry measures the english employed we know that he was captured before the order was given to execute captives we know that he was still alive at the end therefore he was spared the execution we know that he wouldve been charging into heavy longbow fire mounted or dismounted across a field of mud we know that english knights and men at arms wouldve greeted him with halberds on the far end we know that knights suffocated in the mud a fate that wouldve almost certainly befallen him if he wasnt thrown headlong from a horse le maingre survived everything that we see jon survive and then some trying to pretend that historians dont know what theyre doing or that historiography doesnt exist doesnt help your case it just makes you look ridiculous being part of and surviving a charge on horseback is fine thats not what jon did he charged alone on foot to the middle of the battle field and let of cavalry run head first into each other an arms length away jon wasnt part of a cavalry charge he was a bystander at the exact point of impact for one while on foot again huge difference it was not the point of impact his own cavalry surge past him if youll recall the collision happens ahead of him from that point the horses and bodies of his own men act to shield him from the initial shock and after the initial collision is over its just a glorified melee no i object to jon being trampled into the mud by of men in armor and not just surviving but being completely uninjured thats not just surviving the press once again huge difference we see or hear maybe a dozen people far from step on jon and the majority of his army at this point is either lightly armored infantry or wildlings who have basically no armor at all notice who gets stabbed by the bolton pikemen when le maingre went down in the press it was alongside the flower of french chivalry who wouldve been armored in the best steel france could produce he was literally the only one to target one more time huge fucking difference except theyre not aiming at him notice how the arrows impact up and down an imaginary line as if each individual archer simply fired at what was directly ahead of him thats volley fire the vast majority of the bolton archers are unable to hit him even if they wanted to because theyre not firing at him we see bolton archers spaced a few feet apart so at best jon avoided being struck by about four arrows not exactly damning and since youll probably make some absurd argument about how opting for volley fire instead of having everyone aim at him was more plot armor it was so the commanders would know exactly where subsequent volleys would fall fighting traditional battles is not playing any one specific persons game you keep getting hung up on traditional battle while simultaneously ignoring everything that happens on the tactical level of the battle except the vales arrival since youre trying to spin that to your advantage no matter how many times you try to tell yourself or me this theres a staggering difference between fighting a defensive battle and fighting an offensive battle especially if your side is outnumbered its the difference between agincourt and bauge ill give you a hint england lost bauge why because they abandoned their position for an illadvised headlong rush at the enemy sound familiar in what way did jon use ramsays own methods against him ramsays methods had jon completely defeated a battle is not over until the other side is dead surrendered or fled warfare failing to remember that and to retain an operational reserve is why the vales arrival was so decisive and why ramsays response was to stand there looking stupid if he had kept even a third of his pikes in reserve that last situation wouldve unfolded very differently but fair enough ramsay had jon beaten until the vale showed up
asoiaf,removed,fuck off you know what i meant it was littlefingers strategy the fact that jon didnt know is a whole other discussion
asoiaf,removed,queen of the seven kingdoms queen of the iron isles daqueenindanorf princess of dorne im beginning to see where this is going
asoiaf,removed,they are thematically narratively completely unrelated moments next time perhaps try posting a picture of how a tree is related to or foreshadows another tree
asoiaf,removed,she had no reaction to her brothers corpse and only had ramsay on her mind youre an idiot if you dont think thats sociopath behavior
asoiaf,removed,his men part built that wall trump built that wall and who paid for it
asoiaf,removed,sansas still retarded
asoiaf,removed,your an idiot where you when danny and sansa where getting raped fucking stooge mate fucking stooge
asoiaf,removed,one minor character says one thing and everyone acts like it was fucking prophecy
asoiaf,removed,reading these comments you would wonder why any of these alleged fans even watch the show so much unnecessary criticism for a great show and great season what a miserable bunch of twats
asoiaf,removed,get dyke for the faint hearted i mean that with nothing but respect
asoiaf,removed,was that a spoiler or just a warning not to spoil things as saying an arc is going to get more interesting seems as generic as i could be while still writing a coherent thought all i revealed was aeron has a pov chapter in twow which is widely known
asoiaf,removed,a song of ice and fire the survivors of flight were dead the whole time ops micropenis confirmed
asoiaf,removed,its like when rpics used to say a place to share interesting pictures in the sidebar and when enough people were spamming pointless facebook stories with a boring picture attached and when enough people complained about those kinds of posts the mods decided to just remove the word interesting from that sentence
asoiaf,removed,oh summerchild there is no need for evidence in a contrived plot
asoiaf,removed,god that guy sounds like a bigger idiot than that kid who tried to kill trump
asoiaf,removed,sadly it makes perfect sense varys is probably going there
asoiaf,removed,i simply couldnt not click it got a lot of things right but also a lot of them wring not worth clicking
asoiaf,removed,oh for fucks sake you couldnt have discussed this in some discussion thread you just felt you had to make a thread with a major spoiler in the title instead its gotten ridiculous that you cant even browse rall a day after the show without being spoiled by some idiot
asoiaf,removed,thats a stupid argument and here is why if you write a fantasy story you set up aspects of the world that are drastically different from our own world things like magic works and there are godsdragons other then this aspects the fantasy world is supposed to reflect our own if everything is allowed you create a story with a deus ex machina behind every corner and that is just stupid and worthless people surviving stabs in the gut and walking again after a good few nights of sleep has not been established and is just lazy and stupid storytelling
asoiaf,removed,dany plot was a bit rushed too much money spent on dragon cgi that merely burned a ship dany to me appears more and more like bernie sanders support who thinks she is entitles to other people money jon snow plot armor was thick and as mel said there is power in a kings blood that is why even gendry fights great
asoiaf,removed,will spread like wildfire exsept they may have other things to talk about soon
asoiaf,removed,a deadly faggot
asoiaf,removed,no it just proves that there are far less book snobs out there than some had hoped for the directing acting writing choreography was all fantastic and that is being recognized by those scores its hilarious to me that the book snobspurists whatever youd prefer to call them i prefer trolls because really thats what they are are such fanatics that they wont admit when episodes are good and give dd credit its sad really most of them are just very ignorant they have no clue at all what goes into tv production and how adapting the book to tv is impossible really yet they still troll away anyway at the end of the day money ratings viewers and awards speak for themselves the trolls can spew on all they want but deep down they know the show is really fantastic
asoiaf,removed,get this garbage ass shit of buzz feed out of this reddit take your shit writing your shit lists and go somewhere else we dont need your literal crap here
asoiaf,removed,why did you just copy and paste someone elses post
asoiaf,removed,arya is gonna crash that party
asoiaf,removed,he died fighting my lord kek
asoiaf,removed,i hope jaime dies too
asoiaf,removed,warden is a military title like cersei is currently lady of the rock but jaime is more likely warden of the west as for the rest gotta wait until next week but the hs wont rule westeros through tommen and something big will happen in the north
asoiaf,removed,the title is a spoiler you fucking dildo you guys are on the front page can you not make your titles less of a spoiler
asoiaf,removed,if martin intended a specific targaryen and he might not have this might be just another asyet untended seed in his garden it probably was one of aegon vs sons that said recall that the show as per maester aemon in the first season has condensed the targaryen family tree by making aerys ii the son of aegon v not the grandson the targaryen lady olenna was referring to in the show could well be aerys
asoiaf,removed,stupidity and willful ignorance totally separate thing yes but i believe it is ignorance that is much more damaging than plain lack of intelligence the ability to understand and manipulate novel situations
asoiaf,removed,i hope there is a good reason behind that and not just so that they can please these feminists that where outraged about how this show portrays females
asoiaf,removed,dany seems to be the only queen anyone is willing to follow asha would be lynched if she hadnt ran to another queen
asoiaf,removed,love it haters book trolls book snobs you are wrong and you know it but youre to stubborn or maybe just ignorant to admit it votes and its a numbers dont lie critics calling it one of the greatest hours in recent tv history one of the most viewed tv episodes ever one of the highest grossing shows ever and likely a multiple emmy and other award winner in tv and film this stuff is what matters you are wrong prove it otherwise you cant case closed go troll elsewhere
asoiaf,removed,their uncle kevin does though
asoiaf,removed,oh did i hurt their feelings who the fuck cares
asoiaf,removed,and dont get me started on not giving him a weapon why would he need a weapon what sort of weapon would you like him to have wouldnt he look silly carrying a tiny sword what if he just decided not to use a weapon
asoiaf,removed,so gratifying to see the dragons fuck shit up in mereen ive had blue balls about that for so long
asoiaf,removed,i was just trying to get riled up couldnt agree with him more actually personally i was not impressed by the second half of the botb
asoiaf,removed,you must be a blast at cocktail parties
asoiaf,removed,we know she can see danger to herself she even says that it is the first thing she was taught to see and the first thing she always checks for my new guess on the hoof is that jon exiles her and she travels south to find beric and thoros again shell be captured by euron at some point as we can assume from the latest chapter release
asoiaf,removed,if we look at the latest damphair chapter though we know she ends up with euron at some point maybe in the show though youre right and shes ready for the chop
asoiaf,removed,new chapter beside him stood a shadow in womans form long and tall and terrible her hands alive with pale white fire jon vi dance the mist rose from her pale flesh and for a moment it seemed as if pale sorcerous flames were playing about her fingers also euron is collecting creatures from all different religions so why not a red one
asoiaf,removed,her job is finished and so is her role oh neat you wrote the books
asoiaf,removed,but he replied to someone saying this is how i feel with nope this is how it is
asoiaf,removed,lowest common denominator shit thats like someone that comes in to a feel good thread just to try to shit on everyones fun all because you cant get a gobbie and are mad jealous cuntmuffin
asoiaf,removed,hes right people who liked this episode are basic motherfuckers who should go back to rgameofthrones and stay there for good
asoiaf,removed,says who its not like wun wun is retarded
asoiaf,removed,mereen was attacked at the time it was attacked for one reason and one reason only to give us a dany saves us on a dragon scene she could have arrived before the ships came or after nope just in time for a conversation with tyrion as a boulder smashes through their room its what bodyguards do they lose their targets have said target come withing seconds of rape then show up just in time to save the day remind me to never hire one again the only reason any of that happened was to give us the save the show is full of these convenient saves always coming just as its about to be too late its hilarious watching you get angry about this when youre actually the most angerindusing kind of poster here who will make excuse after excuse in defence of lazy writing
asoiaf,removed,i dont think theres any mention of her being captured just in the book hes collecting priests from every faith
asoiaf,removed,my buddy and i have both independently hated his performance ill get downvoted for not agreeing with yall but i found him to be pretentious and onetoned its blase to base your evil character off ledgers the joker almost lazy i never really felt i understood his crazy he was just standard crazy which is actually pretty lame because there never seemed palpable reasons for it just throw your hands up and say man that nigga crazy without any substance i think the actor could have showed more conflict or added something more original to the role than just sneers and a glint in the eye honestly playing a crazy person with nuance isnt easy playing one without is
asoiaf,removed,your comment includes spoilers outside the httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikispoilertagsystem if you cover them we can reapprove to create a spoiler tag use this code s things happen to get this s things happen
asoiaf,removed,i got called a cunt and an idiot in reply to my comment i asked the dude a sarcastic question maybe moderate a little lower
asoiaf,removed,yeah the reddit community knows whats really important in writingproducing a show make sure you only cater to the super fans that will watch the series regardless dont worry about the other percent of the world who cares if this is the maybe the most critically successful tv show of all time and this episode is widely regarded as the best hour of television in history we need more schemes and exact monologues from the books it should just be roy dotrice reading asoiaf live come on people i get annoyed with dd as much as the next bookreader but trying to act like they arent doing a magnificent job is pretty asinine
asoiaf,removed,but i would guess you are a woman notice the first part of my comment and i use it as one taking the definition of a word that can function as a noun phrase used by itself and that refers either to the participants in the discourse eg i you or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse eg she it this in this case man is a pronoun and i use it on all genders so it is gender neutral
asoiaf,removed,ur comment perfectly represents the average iq uncultured and adhd show only watcher for people who expected more from the epic that is the got series it was just spectacle porn with little internal consistency and with the realist tone sacrificed for cheap badass moments like ramsay using a sneak attack to kill a dying wun wun rather than jon fking snow and arya having a dazzling chase where she runs full on sprints despite having several stab wounds to the gut
asoiaf,removed,how can he be going to kings landing when its confirmed that hes riding dragons in mereen
asoiaf,removed,sansa knew as little about ramsay as anyone shed never met him or heard rumors of him if she did please post them here but i say they dont exist i am mindful of the fact that its men who are posting these theories about sansa men love to blame women for the abuses they endure she deserved to be raped she was drunk was dressed provocatively was in the wrong place at the wrong time was asking for it whatever that means was unconscious and therefore fair game etc she was a young and inexperienced and very naïve girl from the protected house of stark to the backbiting intrigues of kings landing she was unprepared and illsuited to be queen but she was a young girl with the dreams of a young girl she was innocent not manipulative youd just like to think otherwise because it feeds some dark thing inside you now if you want a manipulative woman the perfect example is cersei or margery even lady olenna but to even suggest that sansa belonged in that group shows your narrow thinking and ignorance and it shows something worse than that but ill leave that for your therapists to deal with
asoiaf,removed,i saw the northmen on jons side wearing helmets and mail jon himself was wearing a coat of plates only the wildlings on his side fought as they usually do
asoiaf,removed,those are personal pronouns of which i agree there are a defined number however go to a page httpdictionarycambridgeorgusgrammarbritishgrammarpronouns on that page where my definition and usage still holds true
asoiaf,removed,we all want rickon to live thats news to me my friend
asoiaf,removed,yeah you didnt
asoiaf,removed,is the premise of meera one day wanting to get pregnant confusing you or do you not know how babies are made lol okay douche since when is simply saying i bet she wants to have is baby a scenario sounds like a blank statement with no supporting evidence at all but okay prick
asoiaf,removed,this is the strategy trump has as well he had lyin ted crooked hillary and who knows who else but he relies on these gimmicks to attract attention too bad no one in the media has been as gimmicky in a good way
asoiaf,removed,thats stupid
asoiaf,removed,its a commentary on our current political structure for all the fighting over some title trump and hilary are doing neither will be prepared when the others come
asoiaf,removed,let us hope trump does not get the iron throne for that would mean all of westeros is doomed
asoiaf,removed,highest quality shitpost well done
asoiaf,removed,after this extended delay do you really think hell say anything until all that stuff is done too if he does hes kind of a dick if not one already
asoiaf,removed,at this point im starting to wonder if your account is an alt or youre doing this out of some kind of personal vendetta your opinion of yourself is disgustling high if you think someone would waste time with trolling you that said i find that normally people who criticize others for over investigating simply dont like theory or the theorist looking at little narrative clues and foreshadowing is actually quite possible with this authors work for example if you read grrms original pitch for asoiaf you find instances of foreshadowing for all sorts of abandoned plot points as well as foreshadowing for plot points which eventually came to pass that said this post isnt actually about symeon or serwyn but you have argued this footnote tirelessly for days while seemingly not really understanding the point and i find that people that cant accept simple opposition to their pet theories usually did the least amount of work to support them blue eyes are a common trait you arent haunted by the army of corpses following you you are seriously overpushing the dragons are wmds angle as i believe grrm already did the mutually assured destruction with the dance of the dragons and i just dont think thats how this story goes and again he doesnt mean it to be a literal translation to our world finally you proposed that somehow grrms story will follow msts despite a complete lack of evidence for that its clear that you dont understand what im actually proposing i understand it very well you just cant seem to deal with the fact that i disagree with the strength which you reach conclusions are we going to get a dead dragon the show seems to suggest that though id bet drogon lives could the entire thing with gillies baby happen yes not that we have a ton of evidence but at least it tracks in a way assuming sam does bring them back north but bran is the lord of light i was focusing on minutiae because i naively thought this could be steered back to sanity
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,make the riverlands great
asoiaf,removed,this dude needs to hurry the f up he is old obese and got books to release he needs to stop being distracted by dunkegg and the show
asoiaf,removed,something something sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,its just a combination of him being worried about the election and it being football season
asoiaf,removed,he said that he will contemplate suicide if trump wins so basically clinton is our only chance for the series being finished
asoiaf,removed,the election still has me in a state of high anxiety i am not sleeping well and i think i check about three dozen times a day hoping for some good news tuesday cannot come fast enough for me i think i speak for a lot of americans when i say that i desperately want this thing to be over it has been so ugly come tuesday night i will either be relieved or suicidal i think i speak for a lot of americans about that as well
asoiaf,removed,im sorry this is rude i know but shut up
asoiaf,removed,nah grrm is just nervous and agitated about the election
asoiaf,removed,its not coming winds of winter is never coming out grrm is old and tires of writing he has his money and we get an ending of sorts with the show so theres less pressure on him we have to accept it and then we can move on
asoiaf,removed,maybe just maybe he is waiting for the outcome of the election before he announces anything maybe
asoiaf,removed,he literally said on his latest post that the election has been stopping him from sleeping well and after the election he will be either happy or suicidal not lying he said that look it up yourselves i have a strong feeling we wont get winds of winter i straight up commented on his blog this morning asking him if the electing is halting progress on the book he usually always responds to my comments so if he responds to that ill update this
asoiaf,removed,im only oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,its probably about the elections does george realize that he can totally rig the elections all he has to say is if this one wins i wont finish my book
asoiaf,removed,grrm isnt writing grrm is campaigning for clinton so basically we learned one new thing from this article
asoiaf,removed,sadly i think it means hes distracted by the election as evidenced by his numerous posts on that subject sigh
asoiaf,removed,come tuesday night i will either be relieved or suicidal were fucked
asoiaf,removed,just another reason to detest her giant meteor
asoiaf,removed,this shit again im optimistic too but calm it down
asoiaf,removed,those are both awful things
asoiaf,removed,come on george its not even a swing state at least come to iowa
asoiaf,removed,i heard that if trump becomes president hell make grrm write again
asoiaf,removed,the election wait for twow still has me in a state of high anxiety i am not sleeping well and i think i check not a blog about three dozen times a day hoping for some good news tuesday twow cannot come fast enough for me i think i speak for a lot of americans when i say that i desperately want this thing to be over published it has been so ugly frustrating
asoiaf,removed,found prestons alternate account
asoiaf,removed,if wikileaks really wanted to make themselves useful they would be leaking twow characters at a time
asoiaf,removed,when i saw him spewing his hillary garbage in front of her campaign signs at some event a piece of me died that picture just screamed twow aint coming soon ya i get it hes not my bitch doesnt mean it wouldnt feel good to slap him after causing me so much frustration its like the worst blue balls youve ever hard x i hate hrc but if he told me if i voted for her hed finish id consider it
asoiaf,removed,the season leaks
asoiaf,removed,apparently three pages were found by marwyn im sure rhaegar could have found some pages at summerhall if it wasnt destroyed there then it would be somewhere in dragonstone
asoiaf,removed,oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,he needs to stop shitposting about the election and finish the damn series
asoiaf,removed,anybody else kind of sad that grrm wants the most corrupt presidential candidate of all time to win
asoiaf,removed,sadly imposing a limit to the number of dailyweekly grrmbling posts would kick up a storm of this is mod abuse accusations the posts we approve for freedom
asoiaf,removed,why is it always the innocents who suffer most when you high lords play your game of thrones are you thinking about tomorrows us elections imagine would could occur tonights season finale of games of thrones will be preempted by the third vicepresidential debate
asoiaf,removed,so if grrm dies before the end preston jacobs can finish the series for him
asoiaf,removed,were gonna build a wall and make fair isle pay for it
asoiaf,removed,a picture of his body
asoiaf,removed,obviously it would make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,alt shift xs video of recycled material has more than time the upvotes than pjs original content smh
asoiaf,removed,or jons name is also aegon
asoiaf,removed,lmao russian propaganda was exactly aimed at gullible people like you who lapped up every single lie from brietbart rt and ha goodman gullible people like you are why people like trump will always win as you cannot distinguish between truth and fantasy so something every single politician does like paid speech becomes evil for you or you believe two coworkers bitching about sanders means rigging and that hillary is involved you will ignore actual evil deeds of someone like trump and what he is capable of in your hate for hillary there is nothing worse than an educated but naive person searching the net for his confirmation bias as long as such gullible people exist any country like russia can play you for fools and always succeed i see no hope for americas future with people like you there
asoiaf,removed,i counted the words omg george pls
asoiaf,removed,i dededed hello
asoiaf,removed,rfeefolk
asoiaf,removed,going to be eight books possibly even nine lol grrm will die before the book at this rate if not from old age then from heart attack hes a bit uhhh large and has the stress of finishing books plus the other projects he decided to take on in his fame this series will never have an ending because hell die long before that well get a book only because its more or less done and the editor can finish and publish it looks doubtful for a book
asoiaf,removed,at the rate its going theres no time for or
asoiaf,removed,full metal batteredwive syndrome
asoiaf,removed,i used the ball of beasts
asoiaf,removed,use context clues you guys are just arguing to be pedantic
asoiaf,removed,yeah its due any minute now my essosian friend hacked grrms email this is what it will say yup and it will say this hahaha aint got shit aint got shit hahaha aint had shit last year aint got shit this year aint gonna have shit next year aint got shit hahahahahahahahha aint got shit imma get up outta here yall stay up hahahahah aint got shit i got money tho money like mayweather money money money aint got shit hahahahahahha respectfully gurm
asoiaf,removed,i think the new kids who have latched onto the series because of the show has irritated him its no longer a bunch of fantasy scifi nerds like himself huddling in blogs on small parts of the web nerding out over his books now its a bunch of self entitled hipsters and emos thinking they are cool because they got into the books and the show yall will hate me for saying that but hes shown that frustration at his new fan base loud and clear tell me im wrong and tell me why
asoiaf,removed,well if you could stop bothering grrm wed all appreciate that of course we all want an update and i even think he owes his fans some sort acknowledgement about the book weve been waiting for for six years but please stop thinking of yourself as our ambassador to grrm you wont get any special treatment from him despite how special you may think you are
asoiaf,removed,hi can you cover any information that comes from these actresses because that falls under spoilers production heres how it goes s extra info once you do it let me know and ill reapprove your comment
asoiaf,removed,just watch the show from the beginning there are enough small divergences that youll be at least a little bit lost if you try and just pick it up at season four or something also i cant see why you think youd get bored its very seriously a fantastic incredibly entertaining and engaging show even when you know the plot if thats seriously a concern and youre too intellectually shallow to be able to appreciate the show as a separate artistic medium because of that maybe you just shouldnt watch at all
asoiaf,removed,the show is a good show for people with no eyeballs or ears or sentience
asoiaf,removed,i take it back and replace it was a steamed fish areshole
asoiaf,removed,shes in dublin currently if her twitter is anything to go by i would imagine if that supposed leak is true shell be in season for however briefly it may be
asoiaf,removed,so why are you still watching then fuck off
asoiaf,removed,its gonna happen
asoiaf,removed,pls shut the fuck up this story has existed for decades this is a major reveal just to see it in actuality
asoiaf,removed,disgusting your pretension and arrogance seeps through every sentence you write any writer that calls someone else a hack can only make themselves stand out by cutting others down
asoiaf,removed,certainly the words of house clinton sorry hahaha couldnt help it
asoiaf,removed,lol yea trump is so dumb and lame he didnt even commit a federal crime and get away with it via another federal crime
asoiaf,removed,hillary clinton
asoiaf,removed,can we keep truecels out of asoiaf please
asoiaf,removed,pretty much all instances of sex scenes in the book are disturbing if you imagine grrms face bluelight by his computer screen in a dark room as he writes them pukes
asoiaf,removed,are you serious no one took that as an insult use some discretion mods jesus
asoiaf,removed,he killed him because he was chinese what a racist
asoiaf,removed,sounds like the same justifications that trump supporters make hes a sociopath but hes my king long may he reign
asoiaf,removed,i agree but back to the other question what are the couple of reasons
asoiaf,removed,yeah every single intellectual every political analyst every author artist scientist economist from every single country warned against trump but of course they are all wrong and brietbart and pizzagate believing people are correct well let trump prove you right or wrong now
asoiaf,removed,what a sweet sweet summer child blog post will be no different than last year happy crying
asoiaf,removed,the hbnd was a pretty confusing reveal in season and to be honest i hope grrm didnt intend it to go down like that way too much time travel for my liking so id like him to talk about how different the show has been and if the writers went rogue or not cause i mean bran actually flying is fucking stupid but i mean no need to rehash that this sub went fucking nuts oh well at least we figured out how to grow shit on mars this year
asoiaf,removed,ok i am pretty sure they are reffering to hold the door h hodor b bran n nightwalker d doori think i dunno bro it was the mentioning of time travel that gave it away but the acronym makes no sense
asoiaf,removed,hodor brand ned door most likely
asoiaf,removed,donald trump
asoiaf,removed,i think that you dont want to sell me death sticks you want to go home and rethink your life
asoiaf,removed,this sub must be bored this is a really stupid question
asoiaf,removed,ill save you some trouble then if hes not announcing that the book is done the only update he can possibly give you is that the book is not done yet
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,enlighten me
asoiaf,removed,but what if rlj and nam ned promises lyanna to take jon and protect him but then he goes to starfall and ashara gives him his own baby hes all like what the fuck am i supposed to do with two babies so howlands like bro ill take her then meeras still got that sweetass stark blood s
asoiaf,removed,you guys are actually retarded their society is based on following the strongest she killed all the strongest and walked out of a blazing inferno completely intact why would they be upset that she killed their leader thats how new leaders are always picked in their society it doesnt cheapen the plot at all how often has this benefitted her in the three year timespan of the story twice thats an event that she uses this to her advantage every year and a half you morons so what if they hate magic something magic happens to her when shes near fire thats not her doing shes not a fucking witch you retards just hate change fuck off
asoiaf,removed,whoever thought jon snow should stay dead is fucking retarded and has no clue how to tell a story it wouldve been beyond horrible writing if jon snow remained dead and i frankly dont care enough to explain why it should be pretty obvious sorry for lack of pc terms but that idea just bothered me so i had to comment
asoiaf,removed,i just rolled my eyes so hard i saw my own brain
asoiaf,removed,but thats supposed to be the point the journey not the destination how does she manage this seeminglyimpossible task i find the idea of her gaining a true khalisar intriguing how will she do this given the dothraki culture turns out you light a sparkler or jingle your car keys or demonstrate the wheel and all the sudden these quaint savages are eating out of your hand i bet that scene was a hit with the liberal democrat demographic the idea that clever white people can charm foreign masses into abruptly dropping their beliefs and falling in line based on nothing but our cultural power and a regime overthrow danny is liberating the dothraki its the dothraki spring the journey is the whole point of stories and were blowing through all the waypoint in a handwavvy halfassed fashion and it just doesnt make sense it feels hollow
asoiaf,removed,thats retarded
asoiaf,removed,i think its a bit like peoples reaction to trump yes he says horrible things hes narcissistic and ridiculous but thats all factored in the baseline for him tywins in that category atrocities are part of his baseline im not angry at joffrey for mounting a septas head on the wall either dany is presented as a protagonist in the story someone we should root for initially at least my reaction is stronger when she commits what i consider to be atrocities than it is to a tywin a cersei or a roose bolten since i was already rooting against them
asoiaf,removed,arrogance is generally not a viewed positively regardless of sex true but men can get away with a lot more bravado smirking and self confidence before being called arrogant thats my whole point
asoiaf,removed,i disagree you dont need to show every waking thought to show tyrions less noble qualities same with dany they could show it through action the show fails to for the most part except i addressed this already i like how you literally ignored the part where i said tyrions moral grayness came from largely his own thoughts how do they show this action they want to follow the books and if you payed attention a lot of his actions on the show do follow the books we just dont get his vicious thoughts on a lot of matters its what separates him from theon and jamie whos arc automatically include actions that would show why they are morally gray good job ignoring that though you really did show that strawman what for though good job you literally said its love of shock value and spectacle make me doubt that nuance and subtler characterizations still on the table you made it sound like those two are mutually exclusive concepts and youre flat out incorrect anyways because the show does include both spectacle and subtle characterization so its an idiotic comment anyways dont be condescending when you cant even comprehend what is being said theon development was fine as is cerceis they also didnt have much of dd freestyling those yes and we had freestyling with hardhome which was a huge improvement over the book mention we also had free styling with brons writing as well as earlier scenes and dialogue from robert and cersei as well as some of varys show exclusive scenes the high sparrow has been a boring and one dimensional with barely any mention going to the populist revolution aspect and being more painted like generic cult terrorists than anything yeah you cant comprehend what i said budget budget budget buddy it isnt difficult that is what happens when theres only episodes and millions of characters to include the core of the high sparrow has been captured any intricacies is lost because of the logistics how are they going to include the populist revolution lets have them film a bunch of scenes with more peasants and other sparrows to fit in screen time that cant really be afforded unless they want to cut out screen time from other pov characters s the core of the sparrows was still captured one dimensional with barely any mention going to the populist revolution aspect and being more painted like generic cult terrorists than anything and the hs isnt one dimensional he clearly thinks what hes doing is correct yes he is manipulative and cunning but there are other parts of him that are present stop projecting the books onto the show no one but butthurt book readers are ever complaining about the sparrows he didnt need to die storywise and he played a good foil i laid out exactly why he did good job with the argument but he didnt and this is once again book readers projecting their standards from the books to the show it isnt i like how you can only use vague arguments like this without stating how its ironic you are projecting and you know it or maybe you dont im seeing a lot of idiocy coming from you so i wouldnt be surprised if you dont comprehend things beyond a basic level hes not really developing as a character actually he is hes learning that hes not as good of a ruler as he might be thats the whole point of the exchange with grayworm and melissandre they showed him a different perspective that he didnt consider tyrion is too practical and yes thats good but theres also a reason why he couldnt say anything back to the not long enough to understand phrase and hes not really doing much of interest this is your own subjective opinion his plot is just about spinning wheels as is jaime no its not something is going to obviously happen with the slaves and the masters even if it is ultimately resolved by dany he did start a deal that slaves were expressively unhappy about that isnt just going to be a red herring oh please ive been defending got for two seasons now ive been a fan for years i like this show even as it is now i just think it went from a show with some depth as it exhibited in the first three seasons to a spectacle action show reliant more on twists tits and violence lol i like how you completely ignored a comment i made earlier im going to quote again and hope you dont just blatantly ignore it not really ive rewatched earlier episodes and youd be surprised by how much they had to cut and as a result lost some nuance and subtle motifs that were cut out season isnt any more deep than season there is a drop in quality but thats the result of execution and logistics from a literary standpoint the earlier seasons werent any deeper than the recent ones the earlier seasons werent any deeper than the newer ones i can go more in depth thats just your bias speaking in terms of literary elements the show has been largely consistent the earlier seasons didnt have any more symbolism or motifs or a particularly deeper exploration of themes and characterization the earlier seasons where better because generally logistics and more events happened more organically but it wasnt a deeper show also dont presume to know whats in another posters head its hairs width away from just straight insults im presuming to know whats in your head based on your idiotic comments i think we went from truely great tv to adequate television if you think this is adequate television then you must only watch toptier shows like the wire or breaking bad those types of shows are the only series this show really loses too in the landscape of network programming and some of the shittier cable shows such as walking dead or suits this show is better than a majority that isnt adequate though i do think most of the time dd try to make something new up it ends up usually horrible such as cerceis and sansas rape scene or the dornish coup season is trekking new grounds and its been great so far definitely an improvement over season as a whole and those are largely new material youre just focusing solely on the bad than painting their entire writing as not great in general you may deny that your projection of the books all you want but you do indeed do so and its clear you dont understand the realities of the shows logistics so im not really going to bother with reading your comments anymore
asoiaf,removed,thats just retarded write properly
asoiaf,removed,idk man i didnt say idiot plot originially the guy above me did and the mod removed his comment i took his definition as fact because id never heard the term before didnt mean to cause confusion
asoiaf,removed,okay so were talking book tyrion then sure hes a little more open to the idea but that doesnt change the fact that he treated sansa well which sansa would tell jon and jon would most certainly take into account the funny thing about writing is that its subjective youre entitled to an opinion but its just that i love how theres a handful of you on here who think youre the authority on it all and apparently have also gotten advanced copies of the last two books as well
asoiaf,removed,damn youre pretty retarded
asoiaf,removed,i dated the asian version of this girl
asoiaf,removed,go fuck yourself
asoiaf,removed,im not easily manipulated for wanting to read about battles battles are exciting both real and fantasy
asoiaf,removed,just because you phrase your request like a demand doesnt mean you can enforce it banning my account banning me
asoiaf,removed,not rape
asoiaf,removed,probably feels like an hour if youre the one dropping
asoiaf,removed,i am fucking sick and tired of the phrase plot armor holy shit get a new fucking phrase
asoiaf,removed,but he wasnt a pedophile the chicks he banged were the same age most of the girls were when married in the books you have to remember people are marryung yr olds in the books yet they arnt pedos up until or yrs ago yo could marry a yr old in many usa states
asoiaf,removed,thats not the point you didnt remove the other persons comment what a load of hypocrisy
asoiaf,removed,what would be the point did they watch got season episode and knew that they could kill white walkers with them
asoiaf,removed,those solutions seem exactly like what tywin did for his own ancestral valyrian sword until he melted ice however concerning blackfyre it was the starting point of two civil wars which proved that blood was more important than valyrian swords concerning dark sister the last owner was br the three eyed crow maybe its at the wall maybe its in the cave of the cotf
asoiaf,removed,i recall seeing something on wotw about margaery and the high sparrow walking out of the sept together surrounded by tyrell forces i can see margaery finding a way to successfully manipulate the hs and not jeopardize her brothers life perhaps have him atone and sent to castle black thats just speculation on my part i cant recall a precedent for the punishment by the faith militant for homosexuality in the books or the show in the books loras isnt even in kl so i really have no idea whats going to happen to him i dont remember anyone being sentenced to death for buggery in the books so im not sure what the punishment is i imagine that he would have to confess and atone for his crime and perhaps a trial by combat will take place but i dont remember homosexuality being punishable by a death sentence in the show or the books does anyone know i can see margaery surviving and then taking revenge on the hs once she finds a way to manipulate him into believing that she is becoming truly devout and fully and completely giving her life to the faith as soon as she is safely out of reach from the sparrows i could see her revealing her true intentions by feigning a conversion to religiously devout we shall see i think shes too savvy to let the hs truly convert her after what loras has endured
asoiaf,removed,didnt aegon iv give dark sister to bynden rivers upon his legitimization no aegon only gave blackfyre to daemon when he knighted him a year or two before in the meantime aegon may have kept ds for himself not that he was in any condition to actually use it for anything practical in the meantime but there is not even a hint that he gave ds to brynden or aegor or daemon or any of his justthen legitimised kids on his deathbed it took daemon more than a decade to rebel so whilst there wasnt an immediate need for daeron to try to lessen the legitimisation of daemon having blackfyre there was no use strengthening it if daeron had of given ds to baelor he absolutely wouldve strengthened the symbolism of blackfyre aegon giving it to daemon instead of daeron himself as the trueborn heir something that those disdained to his rule would pounce on even if he gave ds to say maekar thereby keeping the tradition of it passing to a martial younger son or lower cousin maegor id guess baelon the brave prior to his elder brother aemons death daemon the rogue prince almost certainly eventual viserys ii aemon the dragonknight he still legitimises blackfyre to his enemies in choosing which son should carry the sword exactly what his own father had down in giving blackfyre to daemon instead of him we dont know when daeron gave ds to bloodraven before the rebellion or afterwards but he did as uidreamofpikas said at some stage to weaken the symbolism of blackfyre brynden was staunchly targloyalist so ds was still kept somewhat in the family thereby most likely allowing the main targaryen line taking repossession of it say on his death if they wanted yet he was not of daerons line to pose the biggest threat to his their rule not that he would have as daeron aemon naerys baelor etc had always been so good to him his mother legally even if the blackfyres were extinguished the bigger threat was still bittersteel in being older than brynden of course having the desire to usurp later the gc to try to do so additionally aegor married daemons eldest daughter calla possibly having children with her if so them potentially interbreeding with the other blackfyres id guess that daeron just had ds locked up before the rebellion either gave it to brynden during or immediately after it may be that baelor carried it for some time but that certainly wouldve stopped by the wars start breakspear was certainly smart enough that he wouldve seen the logic in that if the primary objective was to eradicate the blackfyre rebellion wouldnt repossessing the sword serve as a symbolic triumph it certainly would it may be that the targs actually did say when haegon i gave up his sword at the end of the third rebellion or when dunk killed daemon iii to end the fourth or even when barristan slew maelys i to end his threat in the through blackfyre submission one way or another was pretty much the only way they were going to get blackfyre back it may be that the blackfyres were smart to keep the sword away from the main fighting so they would not lose it like they almost had on the redgrass field or bittersteel or a loyal cronies were able to whisk it away before the targs could reclaim it or mayhaps say someone loyal to cousin daemon who it sounds like was the rightful blackfyre pretender leader of the gc who was killed by his cousin maelys for the gcs leadership whisked it away as a fuck you to maelys say the femaleline of house blackfyre that is how illyrio came to possess it to give to aegon especially if one subscribes to aegon being some kind of blackfyre descent it may be that the targs actually did get it back at some stage but it was lost with maekar in the peake uprising extremely unlikely considering the state of their submission but not impossible it was able to escape or prince daeron youngest son of egg when he died against the rat the hawk the pig or mayhaps even at summerhall itself
asoiaf,removed,the show should be hosted by linda antonsson and cohosted by a teenage girl on tumblr who writes asoiaf fan fiction there would be a lot of expletives directed at the poor teenage cohost by linda and each episode would end in an awesome hairpulling catfight id find the whole thing really entertaining
asoiaf,removed,im going to assume youre just being obtuse because you think its funny and not bother answering your question if you actually require an answer then just think about it itll come to you
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,twow is evident it will be published probably next year or ados will take him another years but we will get it too eventually unless grrm dies
asoiaf,removed,come to think of it has grrm really killed that many main characters it would obviously depend on what you consider a main character i would not put say oberyn or quentyn in that category and you wouldnt count any main character who were an outright villain either as those are obviously killed in practically all stories i would say ned robb stark catelyn kinda
asoiaf,removed,yeah if dany goes full retard i definitely dont think tyrion will put up with it but then again neither did tywin really he ran the country for years then sacked aeryss city plus tyrion definitely has the balls to stand up to dany

asoiaf,removed,lmao you are an idiot
asoiaf,removed,id have to imagine bran wont just be a cripple for the entire series due to his age and inexperience he wont be able to be a fighter but having him deliver dark sister to dany might be a nice change of pace for him from the wall
asoiaf,removed,well at the end of br explicitly says that bran will never walk again but he will fly its possible hewas talking in a sort of riddle or even lying but that seems pretty clear to me its possible they decided to change direction with brans characterfor instance they have mentioned a couple times that bran is going to leave that cave which is something few of us ever expected i doubt it would go to dany as she has shown no prowess with a blade meera makes a lot of sense howeverin a way she is even a dark sister as her mood of late is very dark and broodingthough technically less of a sister than she used to be
asoiaf,removed,yea i believe she mentioned in affc that as time goes on she realizes that needle isnt a practical fighting sword and that the faceless men have loads of swords stashed away that would be more useful but that needle is a part of her id have to go back and find that chapter to check specifics
asoiaf,removed,shut up nerd
asoiaf,removed,he was loved nobody liked stannis its like obama running against hillary of course shes entitled to it but we dont like her
asoiaf,removed,thanks for the spoiler buttface
asoiaf,removed,it is true there is some stuff leaked from some guy which i believe is honest because he predicted everything right about last episode days before it aired and he knew details pm me if you want to know more
asoiaf,removed,pm me and ill send u
asoiaf,removed,just pm me first guys and ill reply with the link
asoiaf,removed,a big fu for the spoiler thanks asshole
asoiaf,removed,what were the spoilers is there a thread of them somewhere
asoiaf,removed,what did the spoiler say it was deleted
asoiaf,removed,now i feel out of the loop
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,ah why are the posts removed then
asoiaf,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrqreudpuklm
asoiaf,removed,who ever has an on screen consenting sex scene with sansa me
asoiaf,removed,well at least their purpose of creation was much nobler than the white guys
asoiaf,removed,grrm literally owns a special house specifically for writing actual as of
asoiaf,removed,may favorite theory was that the show would continue to build on a story of fully fleshed characters and plausible story lines within a well constructed fantasy world and my favorite theory was that butthurt book purist wouldnt infest every thread with meaningless and unwarranted bitching about the show between the two of us you are the who got his wish
asoiaf,removed,but what will happen to bryeeeeeeen and ptire
asoiaf,removed,this is getting tiring they accepted her at the time because the king didnt had any male heirs so the moment he had a male heir succession dictates that is his birthright and where did i said otherwise if i could draw i would so maybe just maybe youd understand the very simple thing im explaining to you but since i cant i will stop wasting my time with you now since its clear you just really dont want to see it for that exact reason a monarch is not the head of a house he is the head of in this case seven kingdoms there must be rules to protect the crown but im sure you will also have trouble grasping this very simple concept
asoiaf,removed,i heard it maybe want to get your hearing checked hope its ok
asoiaf,removed,its a miracle i can barely write anything in english and youre doing all grammar nazi with me tsk
asoiaf,removed,no it fucking wasnt the only thing it could fucking spoil is your glee at watching the credits or checking imdb for who it was stating who plays a character and that they tweeted something does not have to mean that character appears in an episode and tells you nothing about what occurs save you bitching for actual spoilers though i guess as bronn says there is no cure for being a cunt
asoiaf,removed,septa unella epitomizes the english football team tonight raped and tortured by an icelandic beast
asoiaf,removed,glad someones sane where did all the haters for season go i find it hard to believe that theyre actually ok with this have they just been drowned out by the huge influx of casuals
asoiaf,removed,i think that was intended to just be extra dramatic since they wouldnt show a giant zombie raping a nun in the ass till he split her in which l if i remember correctly is what he did the sun spear family
asoiaf,removed,anyone in this sub find it kind of interesting that every person who hated this season seem to be donald trump supporters probably has something to do with the amount of women being pushed into leadership roles this season tlrop is a trump supporter it shouldnt shock anyone he disliked this season as much as he dislikes sjws and white privilege
asoiaf,removed,gonna need bran to go stick his dick in the timeline and stop this from ever happening
asoiaf,removed,cruella deville looking bitch
asoiaf,removed,thatcher clinton and cersei lannister setting a bad precedent for women leaders everywhere

asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,rude i was encouraging our youth to explore beyond the confines of their bedroom had no idea the outdoors was a trigger word
asoiaf,removed,no it was a theory just a stupid theory
asoiaf,removed,man you just suck
asoiaf,removed,me too and no it isnt it might be slang among you and your dipshit friends but its not american slang
asoiaf,removed,hes gonna rape the shit outta her at the number six dance later on
asoiaf,removed,on the regular until she dies
asoiaf,removed,given that hes a giant im sure his fingers suffice if that was a real complicating
asoiaf,removed,i dont want to be a mod here and i definitely dont want to be associated with them sadly this is the best forum for asoiaf so im going to stay and complain if i were a mod id allow preston jacobs watch series theyre being removed because theyre off topic not likely to lead to discussion of grrms story or world or silly according to ujoemagician who later affirms that theyre being removed only for being silly the problem here is that they lead to discussion despite them being silly perhaps i should be a mod so that i can find any post that has the potential for humor and delete it outright or maybe i should just report every post and comment that i think that someone might potentially find humorous since the mods apparently want that gone from this sub perhaps we all should start reporting every post and comment that we personally find to be silly for me personally i think that the show is sillier than preston jacobs so perhaps every post about the show should be deleted
asoiaf,removed,did you grope her or something how does an actor feel familiar
asoiaf,removed,as someone else itt said you dont need a penis necessarily either which is true my mother was raped by a broom handle while she was in a county jail i know i know as horrible as this is you want details okay so cops are pissed off because she wont confess to my dad beating herraping her and abusing drugs not because they care about her they just hate him so they come up to her cell and start asking her and her cellies about what sorts of illegal activity they are doing cigs drugs etc all rampant trade in jail and some of cops are probably in on it because my town is corrupt as fuck and of course none of them say shit they take my mom out for some one on one questioning to an interview room she still wont say anything so they load her up with snacks and goodies and send her back to her cell thank her whole nine yards in front of her cellies who of course will not be convinced that my mom hasnt ratted them out proceed to rape her with broom handle that one of em swiped from their janitor job i saw the video tape or at least as much of it as i could watch yeah you dont need a dick just a dead fucking soul then there was the time they pushed her down a flight of stairs while she was on a mattress because she couldnt move too weak and needed a blood transfusion she has a chronic illness but they didnt believe her so evidently down the stairs they went no video from that one but from what i have seen and know about the shit that goes down in that jail it doesnt surprise me
asoiaf,removed,am i the only one that thinks he looks like trump here
asoiaf,removed,he could always give her a proper fisting
asoiaf,removed,calling him a monster is triggering check your literary privilege plz s
asoiaf,removed,i would do anything to be a mod a man has no gag reflex
asoiaf,removed,for me personally daenerysdaario goodbye scene was completely unnecessary just like any other scene between the two of them he is no khal drogo the two of them had just about as much romantic chemistry as bill and hillary clinton in other words none i know daenerys needed second sons to invade meereen but i am failing to understand the purpose of daarios character after that
asoiaf,removed,dd zack snyder confirmed

asoiaf,removed,is it just me or does this look like donald trump
asoiaf,removed,idiot lol
asoiaf,removed,bless them for watching the show and making it a financial success for us viewers who actually understand what the fuck is going on
asoiaf,removed,alright pleb
asoiaf,removed,faggot confirmed
asoiaf,removed,honestly i think its a hyper feminist agenda run amok honestly i think youre a complete moron
asoiaf,removed,you are retarded dude
asoiaf,removed,jon is a great character since day one jon had multiple occasions in which he could and actually did die you know why because he was acting rash and stupid or in your words retarded which is fine because he too was still a child and still naive he had naive dreams about being a great fighter just like sansa had naive dreams about being a princess just like robb was naive and still a child and got a lot of people killed children do dumb naive and selfish things heck even ned was being an idiot and therefore got a lot of people killed focusing only on sansas faults only shows your bias therefore you saying that the show dont push feminist agenda because of jon and sansa is bullshit wtf i didnt say anything about a feminist or antifeminist agenda but now its clear why youre so upset about all of this its your agenda thats triggering you ill leave it as is
asoiaf,removed,itt they didnt write the characters like i did in my woefully unpublished fan fiction novel jon snow of borg
asoiaf,removed,hes like westerosi trump
asoiaf,removed,theres strict continuity and implicit continuity strict continuity is for ocd lunatics who freak out if their pencils arent perfectly perpendicular implicit continuity is more than enough for good storytelling
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,so you want episodes of arya on a boat doing nothing you probably also complained that we dont have time for the tyrion joke scene this season
asoiaf,removed,hand holding is fun isnt it imagine being the writers of the show
asoiaf,removed,no easier way to make yourself look superior than by taking something a lot of people like and nitpicking it
asoiaf,removed,you didnt need to mention anything about sjws or feminism for anyone with a brain to look through your post history and put and together doesnt change the fact that youre a lunatic trump supporter
asoiaf,removed,yeah yeah im a very naughty man ill buy the blurays when the shows over
asoiaf,removed,it is pretty insensitive to suggest that people with mental disorders are lunatics udabusurvivor its also insensitive to fail to allege that someone has said something that they did not in fact say i did not suggest anything of the kind and youre an insensitive idiot for saying so in fact im going to go ahead and say youre an illiterate asshole strict continuity is for lunatics what sort of lunatics lunatics who are obsessively compulsive to the point of disorder about such matters nowhere in that qualified statement is the implications that all people with ocd or any other mental disorder are ipso facto lunatics some lunatics may have ocd just as many people who do not bark at the moon have ocd some people are also illiterate assholes who spew shit without sense or reason
asoiaf,removed,awww did he hurt your poor little feelings
asoiaf,removed,itt jetpack apologists bunch of toolbags of course you can see what people are talking about stop acting like such insufferable assholes
asoiaf,removed,how the others interacted with someone like craster to make a deal with him donald trump helped make them a deal
asoiaf,removed,well said eat a dick linda
asoiaf,removed,ramsay trump that would be horrible
asoiaf,removed,id say the audience just sucks at paying attention and wants to be spoonfed everything
asoiaf,removed,nigga can rap tho
asoiaf,removed,is reading that difficult for you no wonder you missed this retard
asoiaf,removed,oh ukalskotos you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,i understand what youre position is and youre right but let him argue his own point dont bail him out when hes being a dick about it
asoiaf,removed,technically they are but they are farremoved distant relatives thru roberts grandfather
asoiaf,removed,euron for king make westeros great again build a w oh right
asoiaf,removed,he said she was his only living relative that is my point of contention read the rest of the comments
asoiaf,removed,pls george
asoiaf,removed,stop using nailed it in your posts you cunt
asoiaf,removed,im guessing well see more of her next year at least in a harrenhal flashback
asoiaf,removed,not many religions look down on rape victims wish i could agree with you mate under sharia law in places like qatar and saudi arabia if a woman has sex outside of marriage even if shes raped shes apostate and will be treated as less than human and while modern western christianity and judaism are far more progressive on this subject the old testament both religions are founded on is just as regressive as modern islam its nice that catholicism has deigned to give nuns permission to be raped without recourse i suppose sorry to bring such an offtopic and grim reality to an undeserving subreddit but i couldnt keep silent
asoiaf,removed,i think its more like hsbernie sanders the whole glorification of the poor and demonization of the rich is much more a bernie thing than a trump thing
asoiaf,removed,um yes you bolded all as well before you edited your comment nice job trying to save your own ass though
asoiaf,removed,i now know what happens since someone decided to fucking spoil the episode for me asshole thought id apparently want to know what happens with arya and the waif and with another major character in the upcoming episodes dunno how they thought it was cool but the mods deleted the comments i assume
asoiaf,removed,aww thats pretty cute that your mom likes your little book get your shameless plug account the fuck outta here
asoiaf,removed,not even slightly originalfunny but what can i expect of someone who lies about something so stupid
asoiaf,removed,i found online the whole chapter is it legal to post it here
asoiaf,removed,didnt sound fake i dont think they were even trying to be a dick but it was like dude wtf why would you say that
asoiaf,removed,but think of what that says about politics and perception with confidence euron rambles off a terrible plan talks about his cock and becomes king donald trump speaks at a grade level and is the republican nominee
asoiaf,removed,feel the bern
asoiaf,removed,oh i get it you dont bother to understand other peoples arguments so you get to call them dumb without actually formulating a rebuttal
asoiaf,removed,i have to admit you opinion cut my wrist because it was so edgy and unpopular
asoiaf,removed,assuming things are you fucking serious im judging her based on her goals actions and motivations if someone planned to go murder a bunch of babies am i not allowed to dislike them until they actually do it i swear dany fans are fucking logic immune
asoiaf,removed,mod lady have you seen which language this troll uses in almost all of his comments its all fuck fuck fuck you you are dumb blind fan stupid little girl and my denial in keep answering him is condescending
asoiaf,removed,thanks for the silver p and yeah its so refreshing to have nice adult discussion im very new in reddit and just survived my first battle with a troll in the dany thread i shouldve known better to engage in pointless argumentation anyway have a nice day
asoiaf,removed,i cant stand it either its worse than the if you think this story has a happy ending line being repeated adnaseum as far as dds hate the adaptation of a book series of this magnitude is an insane thing to even try to attempt do i think they have messed up a few times sure for instance i wish they would have opted for the fageon storyline over dorne and i wouldnt doubt that in retrospect they feel the same i also understand that with the popularity of oberyns character why the went with dorne the the show is way better than people make it sound and i understand certain changes have to be made certain things have to be adjusted left out or amalgamated you cant possibly please everyone
asoiaf,removed,people like to ignore context for a good old meme see the bad pussy line itself
asoiaf,removed,show content is outside the scope of spoilers affc if you cover the show content we can reapprove to make spoiler tags type this s like this to get this s like this
asoiaf,removed,yo i gotchu fam
asoiaf,removed,found the nonbookreader
asoiaf,removed,wow you are out of your fucking mind there are so many female characters that this show is head over heels in love with gtfo of here with that whiny bullshit i really love cat dany and sansa too but there are valid reasons not to that have nothing to do wth sexism i hope people slap you when you say shit like that irl
asoiaf,removed,fuck off
asoiaf,removed,sorry for being late but where can i read them
asoiaf,removed,dude have you read the new aeron chapter euron is most definitely not a bit character hes en route to killing gods sitting the iron throne and becoming a god himself
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,i dont think its meant to be prophetic keep in mind how bad of a shape hes in already and then his brother gives him some pretty trippy drugs the vision is just aerons about fears that euron actually maybe more divine than even the drowned god and hes going to take over the world with dragons
asoiaf,removed,please cover the spoilers from twow sample chapters and we can reapprove to make spoiler tags type this s like this to get this s like this
asoiaf,removed,i get the feeling youre a bernie sanders fan
asoiaf,removed,i think its hilarious you linked this when its an obvious homage to famous map sequences in indiana jones movies
asoiaf,removed,or maybe youre just stupid as shit
asoiaf,removed,not a question just an fyi s as far as grrm knows lsh was cut
asoiaf,removed,hey there your post was removed because the video is offtopic this video is mostly about preston and his experiences at balticon
asoiaf,removed,i guess im just not shit retarded like every one else here and understood that when you read you should read in context
asoiaf,removed,you fucking hypeslayer rcleganebowl send their regards
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,i cant tell if you are being obtuse trolling or what but its not worth going over again
asoiaf,removed,preston jacobs is a fuckin clown
asoiaf,removed,enhance
asoiaf,removed,nah bruh bronn is a real nigga nobody fucks with him if you even try to fuck with him you will have to mess with me and my dogzz fuck the haters swizzzlefish we out here hopsin is fucking gay
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,all jokes about martins inevitable demise aside i would be legitimately upset if we dont get a final conclusion out of the next two books i would drop the series for good if the last page of book has some iteration of to be continued
asoiaf,removed,murderous weddings
asoiaf,removed,a suit of armour is a far less practical use of magical supersteel than using it in a weapon its still going to have weaknesses that can be exploited and more its further on the same path of how a sword even made of castleforged steel is an expensive weapon because it serves no practical purpose other than to kill men in single combat and is as much to demonstrate a mans wealth as it is a tool for warfare i wouldnt be surprised to learn that valyrian steel before the doom even if produced in limited quantities was hoarded the same way diamonds are hoarded in our real world in order to artificially manipulate their value
asoiaf,removed,remindme minutes
asoiaf,removed,gay lol
asoiaf,removed,i get bored on the train ride home
asoiaf,removed,woah mr trump lets check the racism at the door giantlivesmatter
asoiaf,removed,you mean that brad made them build a wall and pay for it
asoiaf,removed,george is the chances he dies in his seventies depends on his health which might not be perfect considering his stature if he keeps the current release rate he will be dead before book anyways
asoiaf,removed,suppose grrm died before the last book or two in this versioninterpretation of things came out who would complete the story
asoiaf,removed,guys freaking years old twow will likely wont be out until then he would need an extra decade to write the last book at years old the onset of all sort of mental health problems that will likely affect his ability to write at the pace he does which even now is kinda slow i will be surprised if he finishes ados
asoiaf,removed,hey guys i just want to ask this simple fucking question do we need a hbomb to finish asoiaf we want to kill people we need something bad to happen in westeros some crazy shit that would kill a lot of povs for no fucking reason lets see nowwaitwait i found it lets release cold zombies to kill everyone for no damned reasoni dont think thats possiblewait a minute we can do that how you ask me take the fucking wall down
asoiaf,removed,grrm will be dead before he finishes at that rate
asoiaf,removed,this topic is labeled as spoilers published which may not contain information from game of thrones especially the sixth season or twow if you cover the spoilers with spoiler tags well put it back thanks
asoiaf,removed,daenerys mother of dragons burner of innocents conquerors of stable empires she leaves tens of thousands dead and homeless in her wake shes no ruler just a conqueror and like most women she has no character intelligence or loyalty when she has one or more of her dragons used against her i hope drogon dies bitch will have to eat some humble pie maybe shell get her head out of her ass and finally stop her reign of terror
asoiaf,removed,dont read them dont google them dont even think about them
asoiaf,removed,dd dont understand asoiaf in my opinion they shit on every characters story arc and give tender love to danys story arc because they are feminists and hilary clinton losing the election makes me think they are going to push hard on woman power and its so cringey just thinking about it grrm might too though considering his latest posts on his notablog
asoiaf,removed,what is so awful about the proposed events to make you this melodramatic everything i remember from the leaks is congruent with the existing characters and follows the natural progression of their stories
asoiaf,removed,wait what littlefinger thing whats going to happen to him hes my favorite character
asoiaf,removed,its all turning out true im seriously stunned
asoiaf,removed,could it be becauseerrhhe read about everything he carried over from adwd leftovers sans the really juicy stuff gee george trying to tell us you have nothing new done on twow how are the snowflakes gonna react
asoiaf,removed,are you saying you would rather not see emilia clarkes tits
asoiaf,removed,there have only been three sotm in the known recorded history of house dayne three so gerold should get off his high horse and aspire to be better rather than getting all tygett lannister also arthur dayne is qhorin halfhand and the only other qhorin in the given history of westeros is qhorin volmark unless harren hoares brother lord commander hoare whos given name coincidentally is never given is actually qhorin
asoiaf,removed,i for one did not like david rintoul as aerys it was ok i get it he had a few seconds of screen time but he just didnt have the aerys look about him tom hardy as aegor riversquenten ball aiden turner as daemon blackfyre viggo mortensonewan mcgregor as daeron the good imogen poots as shiera seastar colin morgan as brynden rivers i cant really figure out maekarbaelor also unsure about brynden rivers
asoiaf,removed,tom hardy as aegor riversquenten ball aiden turner as daemon blackfyrebr viggo mortensonewan mcgregor as daeron the good imogen poots as shiera seastar colin morgan as brynden rivers i cant really figure out maekarbaelor also unsure about brynden rivers
asoiaf,removed,i mean you have edric storm who while being a bastard is highborn on both sides florent baratheon raised as such treated as such and carries himself as such i think had mya been treated in a similar fashion it would be much more plausible to see her marry mychel i know while robert did not acknowledge her he did visit her and he did mention bringing her to court to cersei where then cersei threatened her and robert struck his wife for the firstonly time and it was an open secret that she was roberts bastard some of the staff at the eyrie would allude to it maddy
asoiaf,removed,emilias recent nude scenes are nothing like the previous ones i think shes fine appearing partially nude after stepping out of burning huts but she hasnt done any sex scenes take her sitting coyly in bed while daario stands around naked makes me wonder if that supposed sex scene between jondany in is actually going to happen ros character became more than just a whore so it would have been odd if she kept wandering around completely naked ive seen interviews and panels with esme the producers took her out to lunch to tell her ros was being killed off there have been much more important characters than her killed off and the producers didnt even tell the actors their characters were dying esme was also given her favourite outfit as a leaving gift so i just dont think her leaving was acrimonious maybe the rumours were just made up who knows but i really think emilia became conscious of the amount of nude scenes she had done she herself said she turned down shades of grey good choice because she didnt want to become known as the actress who gets naked all the time
asoiaf,removed,why not i think he fits daeron the good amazingly quiet strength thoughtful clear eyes full of resolve
asoiaf,removed,i just dont see a situation where edd would ever interact with mya hes a member of the nw first off and secondly hes waaaaaaay the fuck up north
asoiaf,removed,he needs to be more insane just didnt have the look i dont know i just expected him to be different like david bradley should have played aerys that is if his walder frey wasnt so fucking spot on
asoiaf,removed,i am mushroom of the testimony of mushroom ama
asoiaf,removed,dickon is a dick
asoiaf,removed,asoiaf is a dystopian nightmare world women all getting raped is grrms way of saying patriarchy is bad mmk he is a rabid fanatical feminist
asoiaf,removed,mychel took her virginity or they took each others then was forced to marry a royce despite them both agreeing they wanted to marry each other so she is upset to be around her former love who dishonored her or dumped her or whatever she loved him but his father forced him to marry ysilla royce
asoiaf,removed,both and neither a fool learns this early in his career or he does not remain a fool for long
asoiaf,removed,but he works for lf which makes me wonder i bet him and the hound would get along
asoiaf,removed,and not even his youngest sure theyll send them to the wall or oldtown or even to the sept but never to a bastard
asoiaf,removed,physical characteristics such as what you mention can be changed he just has the look about him daeron the good
asoiaf,removed,grrm hates happy endings look at preston jacobs and his comparisons to grrms life and his books
asoiaf,removed,i just said that she slept with him then he married ysilla royce on orders of his father she is upset at the prospect of him being so closehaving to run into him understandably so
asoiaf,removed,costumes and special effects viggo just has that quiet calm about him he would be perfect
asoiaf,removed,at the end of the day what is the point of this thread if grrm wrote even a miserly new pages since adwd the op gets validated predictability re delivery date of manuscript nil zero zilch might as well read the entrails of the nextbest roadkill nice pastime though
asoiaf,removed,i used to believe that bullshit too
asoiaf,removed,christ that man has a lot of influence
asoiaf,removed,everyone always says tom hardy as bobby b but i dont really think he has the easy going boisterous nature to play bobby b hes too angry dark and brooding which makes him a perfect choice for aegor rivers
asoiaf,removed,i dont like the history stories as much so i cant say im super hyped but you go on ahead and be happy little guy
asoiaf,removed,im saying that his style of acting would be perfect his quiet powerful demeanor is exactly what i think of when i think of daeron the good think of king aragorn look at that shit that is daeron the good right there mfr
asoiaf,removed,its kind of funny to me people still think this book is coming out
asoiaf,removed,heres something ive considered if anyone else agrees if jon becomes king like in the show will we lose jon chapters because didnt grrm specifically make the povs not be from a kings rather than the people around them
asoiaf,removed,then go back to he saw the value of jaime as a prisoner and rethink what you just said to me
asoiaf,removed,i think you are mixing the show and books storylines jaime break with cersei is caused by jaimes experience with brienne and him losing his hand he realizes he has been manipulated by people throughout his life and cerseis love for him is based solely on her her terms he was not in kingslanding when jeff died but his last time with her was joffs funeral his desire for cersei is gone her treatment of tyrion makes it worse cerseis treatment of the tyrells is just as bad tyrion reveals cersei has been screwing everyone while he was in captivity too the relationship is wrecked howland reed has not been revealed tommen is and cersei restricts margaerys exposure to him she even forbids loras from teaching him even though tommen wants loras as a teacher and jaime approves margaery did not screw those guys cersei made that up one of the kingsguard that cersei tried to have seduce margaery is the one that spills the truth about her cersei the high sparrow thinks the case against margaery is weak and released her into tarlys custody one person knows what happened to sandor lem was not posing as him a criminal named rorge was wearing sandors helmet after rorge is killed by brienne lem takes sandors helmet who knows what he will do with it loras and renly were seeing each other loras was deeply hurt by renlys death he has become a kingsguard and is good at the job he has been sent on a critical mission to take dragonstone for the crown i think you are mixing the show and books too much
asoiaf,removed,we know in one of the biggest most glossed over details ever that jahaerys and his queen flew up to the wall to battle whitewalkers but i think thats it
asoiaf,removed,or the islamic world i remember reading a study that the average islamic woman gives birth to children whole the average western woman gives birth to islamic men cheat as well since they often get more than one wife with those numbers it is not even fair lol
asoiaf,removed,hi just a reminder this is a spoilers published thread which doesnt allow show spoilers can you cover up that bit about jon in your first sentence thanks example of spoiler code usage s your spoilers here please make sure the quotes are regular quotes and not fancy quotes
asoiaf,removed,masha heddle was later murdered but i dont think catelyn ever knows
asoiaf,removed,its rumored that she might have landed in the vale and became the witch with a dragon that essentially created the burned men tribe
asoiaf,removed,well a lot couldve happened between when she was last seen and the mountains of the moon too
asoiaf,removed,recent history no in woiaf it is suggested a knight i cannot remember his name rescued anorthern princess princess from a dragon during the dawn age or age of heroes
asoiaf,removed,i agree with everyone else who said its unlikely the targs would have had any interest or even availability to go explore the far north on dragonback plus that like the kind of anecdote that would have been mentioned by a character somewhere however it does raise an interesting possibility what if some valyrian did go there at some point maybe long before the doom where there were still lots of dragons around to be spared for that what if there was a book somewhere about that persons adventure to be found or mentioned by a key character at some point and what if that dragon died in the north would it become a wight of sorts we dont really know how long the white walkers have been around not in those lands and could a creature made of fire become an ice demon whatever the case i think it would be the most likely way to get an ice dragon in this universe
asoiaf,removed,in the section on the mountain clans of the mountains of the moon the burned men are revealed to have gotten their name after encountering a dragon and its mistress a firewitch in the years just after the dance
asoiaf,removed,always appreciate a new honest video from preston jacobs cue people calling him a dishonest crackpot
asoiaf,removed,hey just a life fyi aborigines are not a people nor is that a word its an aboriginal person to a land we dont say indigenousess or indigenousese aboriginal is a broad term like pagan as an example in australia we say aboriginal or indigenous to describe the httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofindigenousaustraliangroupnames that were originally here
asoiaf,removed,thats fucking retarded
asoiaf,removed,apparently calling this fing retarded is too much dumb so ill say that is not a dragonit doesnt look like one that would be the most random place for a hint imaginable ridiculous the theory continues on and builds off this
asoiaf,removed,grrm pls pjsnow
asoiaf,removed,i dont understand im not insulting anyone first of all im insulting the idea and i am rating it based on merit in this case fucking retarded is the appropriate tier i added justification for this ranking am i really not allowed to express myself with swear words would just retarded be ok how about stupid which this also os because it is not intelligent analysis but rather just basically making things up
asoiaf,removed,typical westerner talk try to be less of a douche next time
asoiaf,removed,gods he was strong then alive too
asoiaf,removed,where would we be without power tripping mods that know what we really want to post
asoiaf,removed,this is dumb
asoiaf,removed,illusions
asoiaf,removed,i believe the shortest was named donal trump goodbye
asoiaf,removed,nerd
asoiaf,removed,trust me nobody gives a shit about what you think
asoiaf,removed,it does not gargoyles arewere only present on the first keep
asoiaf,removed,dude read between the damn lines geothermal activity does not mean a volcano you are being too literal maesters dont know much about science in a modern context its not a volcano under winterfell its a hot spot for like any number of hot springs in our world no where near a volcano
asoiaf,removed,given his political leanings i doubt it
asoiaf,removed,httpgiantgfycatcombrightoilyhellbendergif
asoiaf,removed,what certainty are you talking about my point is that we are certain of nothing you were the one insisting on what you knew words in english have specific meaning im guessing its not your first language
asoiaf,removed,its gon be very sticky when the book comes out if you know what im sayin
asoiaf,removed,this is never the appropriate response
asoiaf,removed,no we are just gonna ignore it and you wont know till months pass
asoiaf,removed,boy its gonna be a sticky on all the subreddits
asoiaf,removed,if you want to ignore the text in order to further your ridiculous theory thats fine but the dude got burnt to a crisp by a dragon in front of a handful of people its not debatable no matter how hard you try
asoiaf,removed,holy shit look at this guy and tell me you dont feel sorry for this fanbase i dont care if it never gets finished he can do whatever he wants and i will swallow it like the good slut i am
asoiaf,removed,you mean in general the isis leader i think is a prime candidate
asoiaf,removed,im extremely irritated at the people who dont comprehend the dyed blue hair of the tyroshi or whatever they are people its not weird and i think those who dont like it is just because they watched the show first and the show has no culture from the books and is not true to the world of ice and fire the real lore is good and the real fans know it
asoiaf,removed,im extremely irritated at the people who dont comprehend the dyed blue hair of the tyroshi or whatever they are people its not weird and i think those who dont like it is just because they watched the show first and the show has no culture from the books and is not true to the world of ice and fire the real lore is good and the real fans know it
asoiaf,removed,i had a lot less satisfying answer until now a golden hand is still a hand i like yours a lot more
asoiaf,removed,im not the one with reading comprehension problems but okay have fun waiting for quentyn who is never going to show up again because hes dead
asoiaf,removed,why are so many teets being chewedcut off
asoiaf,removed,george rr martin probably
asoiaf,removed,if i could figure out how to pm on mobile i would because honestly i just disagree everything ive read is in character with how the show has presented the characters and their decision making ive seen people quibbling over certain aspectsbut without certain details then its just critiquing something without context of how its set up which isnt fair to anyone because until it airs everyone and no one is right on how they think itll be presented
asoiaf,removed,tywin lannister deleted emails
asoiaf,removed,we havent received any more updates because george hasnt written anything else without the incentive of beating the show hes probably lost all motivation he now has a new goal publish the two remaining books before he dies in georges mind hes got at least years
asoiaf,removed,you know what fk that guy this is just ridiculous seriously ive seen many a deadline and perfect moment for an announcement come and pass without anything happening and yet ive been patient but come on this has gotten out of hand the only way this can be justified is if the book turns out to be the perfect book which answers all of lifes questions and grants immortality and untold wealth and joy to the reader a regular story with characters conflict climax and resolution whose general synopsis was known from the start shouldnt take this long the respect needs to go both ways i admire and respect his works so he in turn should respect and admire my dedication and understand that ive been waiting for years
asoiaf,removed,what he meant was stop whoring around george and start writing or kill the boy george and let the man be born no one gets irritated at him for watch jets games attend cons become producer or putting on sad puppy eyes and writing in between the thing is fans not all obviously with open eyes see him in fucking year doing all he love and like but writing which is his first love you tell me what is wrong in that
asoiaf,removed,bots have feelings too rbotsrights
asoiaf,removed,he would probably show off his full suit of valyrian armor if hes really looking to impress
asoiaf,removed,he doesnt owe anyone anything absolutely all obligations have been filled you want another book but weve none of us paid for one yeah he said itd be ready and it wasnt but he has no contractual obligation with anyone here he could very easily turn round and say actually you know what im done no more books because everyones acting like an entitled ass and hed be well within his rights to do so in terms of the fans i presume that the case would be different with his publishers but as far as what he owes his fans thats a big round zero
asoiaf,removed,i dont know who to call the sweet summer child here the fan who writhes in personal agony cursing grrms name or the other who attempts to stave the anger with the tired scrap of selfsoothing that your wait will result in a better quality book we would all do well to move on to a different fandom rather than fight over the old bones of what george threw us we may have wow tossed at us but theres a strong probability it will be published under unhappy circumstances once the show is over the fandom wont even have enough for the crows
asoiaf,removed,i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces ive been in contact with my secret network of spies across the usa and have been reliably informed that grrm is still fat still attending conventions still operating a movie theater and probably plays a lot of video games not even the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps could finish asoiaf now
asoiaf,removed,its sad but he is probably going to pass on before finishing unless the delay is because he is releasing both books at once but thats wishful thinking
asoiaf,removed,it isnt surprising gurm will only write when the following conditions are true when he isnt going to at or returning from a convention when he isnt going to at or returning from a holidaytravel when the handegg season is on when his chosen handegg team is doing well but not too well otherwise hell start writing about that instead when he feels like it when ralinda actually write the books for him parts of adwd were so fucking terrible they could only have been crafted by lindaaaaaaaaaaaaa herself when there is no stupid internet fight currently going on for him to get invested in when the show hasnt recently spoiled something he was looking forward to writing about so he has to write a tttthe show and books are different post even though the show will largely supplant the books and he will be forgotten look within your heart you know this to be true
asoiaf,removed,dudes getting old what if he gives up the ghost in the middle of the night before the book is finished what if he gets poisoned by his enemies before the book is finished seriously though i cant actually imagine not having the book be released
asoiaf,removed,people think that we may get a glimpse at rhaegar and lyanna meetingwedding in a bran flashback coupled with a posttweet from some guy named devin oliver hinting he might be in due to his looks its making people think he may be playing rhaegar
asoiaf,removed,i remember when he would get mad at the suggestion he wont live to finish it now ill be truly impressed if he lives to finish it
asoiaf,removed,eh is it really dumb in the same way that balon is dumb if he actually has some kind of mental illness do you call retarded people smart
asoiaf,removed,welcome to the real world were idiots and unfit people get to do shit that they shouldnt had bad managers bad leaders unfit teachers we live in a world of mistakes just look at the us presidential elections two idiots who shouldnt be anywhere close to an presidential election yet they are unfair world mate unfortunately its what we have to accept
asoiaf,removed,got some fanfic names haha
asoiaf,removed,i am sure i will get downvoted but who care this is a medieval story lyanna stark was not the product of century you know where everything is a neotraumatic experience every god awful word is a trigger and anything that doesnt fit into some absolute inflexible allencompassing theories of societies is shot down as a privilege appropriation etc etc the night king should thank his stars he is not in the age of fake social media messiahs and their puritanical inquisition the night king would have lost hands down in fact he would probably have turned back and run off the land of always winter even before the war broke out after listening to the collective shrieking on twitter just saying
asoiaf,removed,ecks dee
asoiaf,removed,he did a shit job ill make the riverlands great again
asoiaf,removed,lol okay there was no concept of statutory rape in medeival times jeez idreamofpikas has no issue and both of seem to be having an interesting conversation i have seen this type of herd mentality on other forums people who have nothing to add but start to speak on behalf of others making random comments even if they didnt ask you to
asoiaf,removed,i also enjoyed how in they had a shitty discount vaes dothrak when they went the first time then when they returned it had the book description vaes dothrak with the giant horses as arches
asoiaf,removed,make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,its as subtle as a being hit in the head with a hammer we get the rat king story from a bran chapter which would be considered a weird out of place tangent if not for the later event we get numerous mentions of the missing freys and manderly talking up his memory and vengeance now that his son is safe we then get the specific request for a rat king song and manderly serving up pies in an oddly enthusiastic way to freys shortly after being asked about the missing freys youd have to be illiterate to think that was subtle
asoiaf,removed,thatd be pretty great i guess of all the plotlines weve gotten nothing from so far cersei would be pretty great personally id want sam because a hes the character we havent heard from in the longest time and b because oldtown is about to become a giant clusterfuck of craziness and i really want to see what happens were definitely not getting anything at the wall davos would probably be the other big one
asoiaf,removed,wow we need twow to come out
asoiaf,removed,httpwwwpornhubcompornstarsibelkekilli nsfw
asoiaf,removed,who is that again
asoiaf,removed,show me where germ said that
asoiaf,removed,this is just the series obviously but lyanna mormont i just dont really see what the fuss is all about and shes a bloody hypocrit
asoiaf,removed,then youre very clearly simple and a fool as discussing asoiaf is exactly what this sub is for have a good night
asoiaf,removed,i beg your pardon the other user was in clear violation of reddiquette and saying a topic about asoiaf wasnt appropriate for the asoiaf subreddit that is by definition foolish there is nothing uncivil about calling something what it is
asoiaf,removed,thats why every basic bitch that watches the show loves her these are the same people that still think her name is khaleesi
asoiaf,removed,i understand that morality is subjective but in the eyes of the reader and probably all of the asoiaf common folk he is pretty uncool he burns people at the stake which is a pretty terrible way to die next to beheading or hanging he hurts children see edric storm and showshireen and he tries to outlaw brothels which isnt necessarily evil but outlawing a major source of tax revenue and pleasure for kl be cause it goes against his views of decency is not exactly beneficial to the realm and is fighting a fools war in the north against northerners because its his duty
asoiaf,removed,you must be new here
asoiaf,removed,i wish i could downvote this twice
asoiaf,removed,sooo deep
asoiaf,removed,thats what happens when you have to wait for the next book for five years
asoiaf,removed,its bullshit dany and drogos child was actually rhaenyra targaryens stillborn daughter
asoiaf,removed,wtf
asoiaf,removed,wtf
asoiaf,removed,get your arse home and start writing george
asoiaf,removed,yes because trump has hired assassins and tortured people im getting very tired of the virtue signaling from celebrities puts me off their work completely way to alienate your fans george
asoiaf,removed,i must like you the brackets next to your name tell me ive upvoted you times so take this in the spirit in which its intended do you think that maybe saying things like it just seems like shitcovered tinfoil to me might be part of why you get downvoted over it do i believe ddt no not really but i find it entertaining its fun to occasionally care it to the extreme ends of silliness getting hot under the collar or insulting over other peoples goofiness doesnt stop it it just makes you look like a killjoy ddt isnt everyones cup of tea which is fine but let it go and move on dont rain on the parade i dont really believe that benjendaarioeuron but im pretty much going to roll with it every time i see it
asoiaf,removed,oh i got that i was just throwing it out there that if joffrey lived to the historical perception of him may come out differently but really i just completely disagree with the comparison joffrey was a spoiled brat bc he was raised that way by cersei trump built himself into who he is could he have more humility sure it would be more apt to compare him to tywin both built there family into a contemporary powerhouse pretty ruthless wanted to do what was best for the kingdom wanted to rule wealthy etc
asoiaf,removed,ok maybe a bit unpleasant but you dont get angry being called fat by someone whos not only even more obese than you are but also a retard thats how i imagine jon thought when he heard ramsay calling him a bastard if i were him id literally go like har
asoiaf,removed,this is some trolling well played
asoiaf,removed,shes gonna rape a bunch of men
asoiaf,removed,mate i hate to rain on your parade but this has been brought up like times i got told there were already too many threads defending sansa when i posted one the very next day after the episode this sub is quick man you either get in on the discussion right away or youll be lost to oblivion
asoiaf,removed,there was not this shitting on the show till it turned really bad which happened last season and continues to this one if theyre pretentious book snobs and you still like the show ive got to say that makes you a blind simpleton fanboy
asoiaf,removed,something to think about as of season of got there was no isis
asoiaf,removed,if you sit down to watch the show every week that makes you a fan if you enjoy the simpleminded story telling that doesnt make any logical sense that makes you a boy fanboy also i take it that youre not that big of fan of the books since you do not recall that greywind would regularly fight with robb in battles and be just fine but youre right chad the show is awesome
asoiaf,removed,in the epilogue of adwd cersei mentions that ser pounce often gets in fights with an old black cat an old black tomcat with a torn ear cersei told him a filthy thing and foul tempered he clawed joffs hand once she made a face the cats keep the rats down i know but that one hes been known to attack ravens in the rookery epilogue adwd i dont think the choice of words has any real significance but if its a targayan cat makes sense it wouldnt like lannisters
asoiaf,removed,thats precisely what he means what dont you understand its all clear as day in the post whether you believe it or not
asoiaf,removed,id want to taste the boar that gored robert some of that sister stew davos had swan and eggs with cheese and dragon peppers cooked the dornish way my adventurous would be snake coooked with dragon peppers and a drop of snake venom id rather go hungry than eat a bowl o brown
asoiaf,removed,and it is warged by bloodraven it has only one eye fitting the thousand eyes and one it is known
asoiaf,removed,just like the fleeing wildlings todays refugees are also seen as either in need of dire rescue or as troublesome people of a different culture i dont think so most of these refugees are responsible for their failed nations the fighting age men are leaving to live in welfare societies wildlings call themselves free folks and are proud people the refugees in syria on other other hand are weasels in my honest opinion
asoiaf,removed,hes a total nutcase he genuinely believes that revived jon is not actually jon but someone controlling jons body like a puppet lol
asoiaf,removed,i dont think you get pregnant doing shades of grey between sansa ramsay
asoiaf,removed,oh fuck off go watch the ones mention sift through the diluge of crap he puts out just listen the first minute of this video is dripping in smarterthanthou condescension

asoiaf,removed,its ok mod i understand but its really a shame that most people are real pieces of shit and that we cant have a decent conversation about current events as it relates to fiction
asoiaf,removed,i legitimately thought the same thing and upon rereading was super freaking sad no chance for bye bye bye as i stab you in the face with a sautéing islam now
asoiaf,removed,i dont think medical science has progressed to the point that it can keep grrm alive that long
asoiaf,removed,do they normally make new crowns for dead kings

asoiaf,removed,could you tone down the bold header text please this is a quiet sub with peaceful people
asoiaf,removed,heh yea lets all be poor and raped together instead of rich and safe alone am i right s
asoiaf,removed,i agree with you especially with the new changes to the eu britains need to watch out for them and theirs first most above anything else and before anyone crows racism go look up where the minority vote was plenty voted leave
asoiaf,removed,shes bringing foreign sellswords shes bringing dothraki screamers shes bringing ironborn reavers and some she assumes are good people king tommen were gonna build a wall along the narrow sea and make daenerys pay for it
asoiaf,removed,man the artist caught the muh stronk womyn syndrome
asoiaf,removed,cersei will build another wall and the dothraki will pay for it
asoiaf,removed,we see margaery wearing didnt we see tommen getting his crown in the crypt it better be a simple one like a science comment regarding a world with dragons
asoiaf,removed,arianne aegon jon connington the shavepate belwas the tattered prince harry the heir manderly alysanne mormont jeyne poole garlan tyrell the crows eye victarion greyjoy quentyn marwyn balon swann darkstar all of them are somehow important some of them are even pov characters and all of them are absent in the show at the very least start with book iv affc just after gregoroberyn duel
asoiaf,removed,make westeros great again daenerys for queen of westeros
asoiaf,removed,and shut the fuck up about plot armor hes probably the most significant character in the story right now if you knew anything about fiction or storytelling you would know that the only reason there is a story is because something significant happened in the life of the character we are following the story isnt about people dying of course he has so called plot armor next i assume you will go complain about the hobbit because of bilbos halfling sized plot am or
asoiaf,removed,so fat is basically the opposite of ted cruz

asoiaf,removed,jeezy petes that is expensive they arent worth that much i think theyre availale on youtube or there are other ways of acquiring them
asoiaf,removed,it was not ok your comment didnt stricke any comical notes at all
asoiaf,removed,the first four seasons are very close to the first books with a few exceptions the fifth and sixth seasons have cutchangedrearranged a lot of elements so some plot point match and others youd need to read up on here is where the main characters are by the end of the last book similar tobeyond the books bran still with jojen is alive cersei just finished walk of shame jaime never went to dorne no bronn jon still dead in the books arya still training as faceless man different from books sansa still in the vale with littlefinger never married ramsey brienne still looking for sansa met with the religious group who helped the hound captured by brotherhood without banners tyrion jorah in meereen but not with danaerys stannis still alive hasnt fought ramsey yet davos sent away by stannis to recruit northern lords in oldtown training to be a maester never returned to his parents theon asha never went to meereen both held by stannis minir differences robbs marriage was more complicated likely planned by tywin stannis left melissandre his family and a number of his men at the wall loras is a kingsguard and has two older brothers cersei is much more paranoid and self destructive jaime and a week have had a major falling out and jaime is becoming a much nobler character the brotherhood without banners has a different leader jorah doesnt have greyscale major differences varys doesnt really support dany he supports a boy he claims is raegars son aegon aegon travels with tyrion for a while and has launched his own invasion of westeros the ironborn are way more important the kingsmoot is much more impressive and euron wins after showing off a horn that can supposedly tame dragons theons other uncle victarion is the one travelling to meet dany the dorne story is completely different doran is secretly working towards revenge with the help of the sand snakes he has two other children arianna and quentyn who are pov characters a lot of people dead in the show are alive in the books
asoiaf,removed,shut up bitch
asoiaf,removed,or kills himself
asoiaf,removed,why does asking someone to expand on their comment without arguing get a downvote
asoiaf,removed,lets be honest we all know trump is jon snows father and kahl drogo has been fisting your giant asshole all season long
asoiaf,removed,thats not a plot hole you goddamned dork
asoiaf,removed,you need a woman mate
asoiaf,removed,so pretty much all the leaks are true
asoiaf,removed,he already suffered enough in ramseys hands just give the guy a peaceful death i really cant stand those things theon is obligated to feel one of the leaks being confirmed but not a good one
asoiaf,removed,i dont know makes some sense to me hes pretty much being faced with capture again theon did being captured before he doesnt want it so he does what a lot of us would do even with out sisters captured and in threat of death
asoiaf,removed,gee thats a lot of
asoiaf,removed,whats the thinking behind these this character post titles are you making a cv so you can work at a clickfarm or is this how the internet generation thinks people are supposed to communicate
asoiaf,removed,is vice just the edgier buzzfeed cause some headlines like a timeline to help you understand what just happened in turkey remind me of that
asoiaf,removed,what i meant is that the world is not black and white and while there are people who are very close to being dark there are others who are grey but who are perceived differently depending on many factors you see good guys and bad guys on both sides of a war take for an example roberts rebellion yes the good guys were in the right because they were trying to overthrow the king a dangerously mad person but some of this good guys were either responsible or complicit in the murder of the innocent targaryen children
asoiaf,removed,what a useful comment that adds to the discussion
asoiaf,removed,france also now has legions of foreigners
asoiaf,removed,no she ate moon berries and had a miscarriage in adwd
asoiaf,removed,i think he is the closest thing tommen had to a son so he has a pretty good claim on the throne at this point he is probably calling his banners and hiring sellswords
asoiaf,removed,woosh
asoiaf,removed,kill them with kindness step obtain eurons valerian steel armor step hug all the white walkers profit
asoiaf,removed,more named lannisters have died than starks starks ned rob catlyn lannisters tywin jeoffry marcela tommen kevan lancel please excuse any misspelled names im too lazy to google them all
asoiaf,removed,oberyn didnt die for this im sorry please forgive me
asoiaf,removed,lannisters cersi jamie their kids tyrion tywin kevan lancel starks ned catlyn rob jon sansa brandon arya rickon who i originally forgot lannisters or dead starks or dead did i miss anyone
asoiaf,removed,kind of bummed they stopped appearing after clash unless they do appear and ive just been too focused on everything else
asoiaf,removed,ramsays arrow didnt
asoiaf,removed,heh kinda makes me think of our world defeating the soviets in afghanistan creates al qaeda invading the middle east to defeat al qaeda creates isis destroying isis creates
asoiaf,removed,at least he said it its one of those things i wish hadnt been omitted from the show it could have led to a vague mistrust and second guessing in jaime making the end of season all the more crucial in finalising his °
asoiaf,removed,when he goes full retard with the hodoring so funny
asoiaf,removed,his name is fucking jaime
asoiaf,removed,arya especially with the braavos plot in season six i was so so disappointed bran because with not only the leaks and his exclusion of the entirety of season five but also with season six and the leaks hes being reduced to a secondary character when hes so so much more important than that sansa because they actually made me like her more as i began reading the books and plus the way they wrote her last season was not great jon because i found him incredibly annoying and lackluster until i started reading the books he is a much more fleshed out character in the books opposed to the show euron the cock jokes and all that the sand snakes including ellaria holy cow man the dorne plot in general was a disaster and there was also very little point to dorans existence
asoiaf,removed,the story about tyshas rape and stuff
asoiaf,removed,lollys stokeworth being gangraped by angry rioting peasants i know its fucked up and i know its the opposite of funny
asoiaf,removed,why cant you be civil in this conversation i never even said i subscribe to the theory i simply gave more possible textual evidence go away now if you dont have anything to contribute
asoiaf,removed,alts correct that its still when tyrion says this but to say it adds up to is stretching things when tyrion would be far more likely to be saying that gerion left in if he left some eight years past when its basically no he means he left years ago youre refuting facts with your own dumb assumption furthermore to accept his timeline we have to accept that gerion sailed from lannisport all the way to braavos funny thing is the sailors wife could have been in volantis shes in braavos later we have no idea where she was that year if you accept that tyrion actually does mean that gerion disappeared years ago and in then youre also stuck with the fact that tyrion is saying that gerion left in the end of the year not the beginning where does that say he left at the end of the year it says when tyrion was i dont think we have any inference of when he was born he couldve been born early so the timeline doesnt even work no youre just making bad assumption that arent in the text
asoiaf,removed,no point in introducing goofy zombie catelyn out of nowhere since walder frey is gonna die anyway in the show
asoiaf,removed,euron donald trump confirmed

asoiaf,removed,those two guys are fags
asoiaf,removed,he has to get down from that horse when his fookin brother gets shot
asoiaf,removed,ramsay uses rickon as bait jon dismounts and runs to get rickon who dies in his arms meanwhile the bolton forces surround jon and we get toj fight scene part with jon as dayne only somehow jon survives
asoiaf,removed,battle of the bastards is too forced tbh its not organic
asoiaf,removed,awesome and i love kits scenes well hes seemed a little off this season picture gives me hype i remember reading they had to train someone with swordfighting and thats fine and jaimes dorne scenes were atrocious imo but even bronn looked completely awkward i blame stuff like that on the choreographers except im not sure if it could have been better shooting in that tiny little castle area i dont see the big deal with filming a scene in a particular castle — make a set deepsix the sand snakes and their weirdo whips and spears i dont even blame the sand snakes for that those actresses didnt write awkward weapons and that dialogue ugh just remembered were getting dorne in ep
asoiaf,removed,probably jon after he sees rickon die such a shame that the show reintroduces rickon only to kill him without giving him any screen time this season i think we can all agree that little guy is done for
asoiaf,removed,looks more than just battle fury to me this might be after he sees finds out about rickons death assuming he dies
asoiaf,removed,httpsyoutubeyxqylwljcvi i got lazy and listened too it this guy does a decent job for not being a professional
asoiaf,removed,this is his face after rickon dies
asoiaf,removed,im pretty sure little finger is going to came riding on the rear and take out the ramsey troops its going to be what they do with the mareen fight
asoiaf,removed,this gives me dread the only reason jon react like that is if he had had just seen someone he loved brutally killed feeling queasy for davos tormund and rickon
asoiaf,removed,jaime is about to become king
asoiaf,removed,ramsay executes rickon jon rages and charges bolton horses charge him hence both these shots davos rides up and grabs jon and escapes back to the lines before jon gets himself killed
asoiaf,removed,so danyhillary clinton euron donald trump

asoiaf,removed,the ww arent complete evil maybe they are need food to survive and theres none beyond the wall night king is just a commander of an army maybe they have their own civilization and town governed by senate and ministers we know they have their own language maybe they just want to make beyond the wall great again
asoiaf,removed,i know that this is the wrong sub but black dicks in ya ass cocksucka
asoiaf,removed,grrms writing gets shit on a lot for some reason and i just dont get it he is a master of tone and mood the sad and ghostly vibe that permeates neds dream about the toj is a great example as is the red wedding which reads like a fever dream even before shit goes down theres a sense of unease of wrongness that had me on the edge of my seat even while an ostensibly joyous celebration was taking place the books are good stuff confirmed
asoiaf,removed,boltons karstarks and umbers will be dead their bloody rooms are waiting in hell i the demon stark of winterfell and great son of the bard bael swear to the old gods of the first men boltons will know no rest their arse holes will be flayed and direwolves will feast on their guts the flayed men will know sweet iced pain when they meet the master of the winterhell come my lads come and see how the boltons cease to exist it wont be only because of snow but for a littlefinger in ramseys asshole
asoiaf,removed,his fear of fire is easily exploited retarded reasoning is the author expecting people to bring a torch when they are dueling him khal drogo had one battle in which he severely wounded himself out of pride irrelevant to his fighting ability
asoiaf,removed,if anyone mentions goodmen or sandsneks im gonna rape his chicken tits off
asoiaf,removed,im a rebel

asoiaf,removed,i want him to meet ghost after ghost puts down his dogs jon casts a knowing eye at his closest friend one last dog to put down ghost
asoiaf,removed,i want them to be as badass as the other mormonts weve seen to date i want the bear to flay the flayed men and then give the remains to the flesh eating wildlings how awesome would that be i want oshas words to haunt ramsey
asoiaf,removed,im a rebel deal with it sorrynotsorry
asoiaf,removed,we built a wall and made the wildlings pay for it now we need the wildlings to do the job northerners dont want to do because the north fucking forgot
asoiaf,removed,i felt exactly the same i wasnt much of a reader at first and i wanted to know if things were really different in the books it was after tyrions trial that i started asking myself that so i bought the books and started reading since then i always travel with a book when i commute or at home welcome hehe

asoiaf,removed,you know whati read the books when i was younger and most recent when thru finally came out but when the show came around i found myself infatuated with them again and not only reread them but have listened to the unabridged audiobooks over through while agree with your post that the detail is there on the pages i find i pick up so much of the hidden subtext and plots through the audiobooks i was always better at listening to lectures than just studying texts in school so maybe its a memory thingbut roy dotrice who does all the books and some novellas is amazing he was even supposed to play grand maester pycelle on the show but had some illness that had him decline they still found a cameo for him as the alchemist in the episodes predating the blackwater wildfyre fun times anyway i still hear his voice when some of the actors talkand to be honest i think some of them modeled their voices after his readings take my word for it especially if you literally just listen yo one after the next and so onyou will pick up something new each time with even callbacks from a later book to earlier ones much easier to spot i love the books and own them all but my go to are the audiobooks when i want the nuance of a scene to dissecthe seems to really be in sync with what state of mind grrm had in mind for the characters i really hope twow gets done in time before he isnt able to do them anymoreid really like to have that welcome to the party
asoiaf,removed,now once you get to the end of adod you can live in perpetual anxiety that grrm is going to pass away and never finish the seriesyaaay
asoiaf,removed,you knew it wasnt a complete series he never promised it will be completed he never even promised a date for twow release he does not work for you
asoiaf,removed,heres how the battle will go for the bastard jon snow we greet him with a brother all flayed but jon has more to pay our lord will drop some beats and show jon his amazing feats jon fell for a red head girl and repayed her by killing her ramsey would never do that he would kill any wildling that tried to play with his thing jon led a battle against those with no armor only to be saved by a terrible father he was no brilliant commander either he thought putting his daughter in a fire would somehow stop our brilliant commander the north does remember how his brother got them all killed just to get his ugly uncle laid how could his army join the frey when they were all drunk lets not forget about the greys that our lord had to send away because the starks failed once they lost their heads so please jon go back to your wall because the snow has falled and our lord needs to warm up in ghosts fur i tried to rap
asoiaf,removed,this title reminded me of hillary clinton
asoiaf,removed,op just posted what basically is the outline or the leaked information except lesser what would be cool is if a red priestess or priest were to find ramsays body after he is killed and bring him back to life so that ramsay may continue his wrath later in kings landing now that i would watch why is it that only the good guys get resurrection this practice seems discriminatory
asoiaf,removed,its been pretty much confirmed that we will see about minutes of mereen and of jon snow and co no dorne this episode
asoiaf,removed,ohhhh yeahdig it whatcha gonna do when our rag tag army runs wildling on you
asoiaf,removed,plot twist something pretty dope happens in dorne however more likely though is that word is that dorne does not appear until the finale weve known this since like episode its held up until now so its almost certainly true
asoiaf,removed,shame shame shameon me
asoiaf,removed,youre an idiot im fine with barristan dying alongside the unsullied but jeezus theyre the most fucking trained warriors in the land they are going to get in formation and use their shields and spears to their advantage the harpies couldve still won through sheer numbers trapping and burning them in a corridor etc how it was done was idiotic and looked liked a fear the walking dead episode ive never taken a film class in my life never been on a set and am overall not artistically gifted but i bet my scenes would be times better than what that idiot gave us
asoiaf,removed,i refuse to caps loads of people caps loads of cunts
asoiaf,removed,are you a girl seriosly wtf just watch some chickflick or a soap opera if you want some bullshit kisses and hugs storyline
asoiaf,removed,if you dont want spoilers stay off the internet the op knew exactly what shehe was posting this much should be oobvious no one could predict with such accuracy the outcome of the battle of winterfell unless they had known the leaked plotline get serious
asoiaf,removed,i think botb ends with jon beating the crap out of ramsay
asoiaf,removed,midgets yeah thats basically the same thing as the nword the mword if you will dwarf isnt much better little person is the correct term
asoiaf,removed,it might not be too bad hed only have to read from one book
asoiaf,removed,alt shift x had a pretty good one about the andals making the others pay for the wall
asoiaf,removed,donald trump on building the wall
asoiaf,removed,nice
asoiaf,removed,in how many subs are you going to post these jonhate posts you have posted at least different ones in the game if thrones sub in the last couple of hours itself this is nothing more than a hate post
asoiaf,removed,donald brandon trump we need to build a wall the white walkers are going to pay for it
asoiaf,removed,i fear you have missed a lot from the show firstly jon was able to leave the nights watch because the nw oath states until i die or similar wording and jon had given his life to it now he was resurrected he was free from that oath and its a tv show not a hour movie sansa and jon chatting about mundane things from their childhood is a good way to reconnect between people who hasnt seen each other in years also they have both gone through a lot of bad things and likely wanted to talk about anything but that just to feel normal for a while dany miraculously survived a death by fire again have you even been watching the show its stated a lot that something in targarian pure bloods gives them immunity to fire heat its shown in the very first episode where she walks in to a scalding hot bath and doesnt feel it its shown when she picks up the dragon egg from the brazier im curious how you thought she got out of that burning pyre she walked in to with drogo on it
asoiaf,removed,i dont think phrasing t as a speculative question is hinting as you do apparently your statement maybe dayne is based on dawn his hint according to you could dayne and dorne be bastardizations of dawn your has uncertainty of the maybe his has the uncertainty of being a question if op hinted then you did as well being wrong isnt a big deal you missed that part or didnt remember it correctly or whatever it isnt a reasonable interpretation to say that op just hinted
asoiaf,removed,im sorry but if you seriously believe in that version of the story youre delusional
asoiaf,removed,missandei is still a yo
asoiaf,removed,i wasnt actually looking for a justification of your modding i already left the sub funnily you didnt address my question so you did in fact come because of my report awesome i will avoid reporting anything in the future in other subs less i run into more mods like yourself im resisting arguing point by point for the personal content that you claim my post had i know you will see this as my argumentative assholish nature and thats okay anyway at least take comfort that you have ruined the sub for someone who loves asoiaf and long lurked here goodbye

asoiaf,removed,name one other than robert who did robert isnt a royalist hes a rebel quotes directly and in context saying it to someone off the cuff heres bran telling osha that rhaegar kidnapped and raped lyanna which he was taught by luwin robert was betrothed to marry her but prince rhaegar carried her off and raped her bran explained robert fought a war to win her back he killed rhaegar on the trident with his hammer but lyanna died and he never got her back at all and heres dany saying that rhaegar kidnapped lyanna side by side the queens procession and hizdahr zo loraqs made their slow way across meereen until finally the temple of the graces loomed up before them its golden domes flashing in the sun how beautiful the queen tried to tell herself but inside her was some foolish little girl who could not help but look about for daario if he loved you he would come and carry you off at swordpoint as rhaegar carried off his northern girl the girl in her insisted but the queen knew that was folly even if her captain was mad enough to attempt it the brazen beasts would cut him down before he got within a hundred yards of her heres yandel saying rhaegar kidnapped lyanna as cold winds hammered the city king aerys ii turned to his pyromancers charging them to drive the winter off with their magics huge green fires burned along the walls of the red keep for a moons turn prince rhaegar was not in the city to observe them however nor could he be found in dragonstone with princess elia and their young son aegon with the coming of the new year the crown prince had taken to the road with half a dozen of his closest friends and confidants on a journey that would ultimately lead him back to the riverlands not ten leagues from harrenhal rhaegar fell upon lyanna stark of winterfell and carried her off lighting a fire that would consume his house and kin and all those he loved—and half the realm besides so yes its more than just robert who said it not that that was even my point you said that most people who knew rhaegar do not believe he kidnapped and raped lyanna that is simply not true not a single royalist said he didnt do that your own list of people you listed simply said nothing at all on the topic and you declared it that they didnt think he did but thats simply not supported by the text otherwise youd have actually shown a quote actually saying that they dont exist neither royalist or rebel has ever said that rhaegar didnt kidnap and rape lyanna he might not have who knows but nobodys said he didnt
asoiaf,removed,im sure you do
asoiaf,removed,fuck you you fucking piece of shit
asoiaf,removed,i think robb included a condition in the wording of his will something where he makes jon his heir if there are no trueborns of ned stark he still disinherited sansa and said the north should never be allowed to pass to her and catelyn agreed the will the role jon will play in reclaiming winterfell the north will choose jon that is a major plot point the show forced into the in their awkward way following jons real parentage perhaps george may go in deeper with the conflict that may cause and show how much jon has changed postressurection in his leadership rickon will likely die lf will fail after realising his pawn is heir to nothing in the north bran will return to the wall at the very least and make contact with several starks after realising jon is a targ his right to the it trumps danys a political union or whatever will see jon go south bran is the rightful heir to winterfell and the north
asoiaf,removed,by uplainbread
asoiaf,removed,i dont see any objection to jon snow taking charge of the north in my interpretation all of adwd is leading up to that stannis is having difficulty uniting the north against the boltons because he is not himself a stark whereas jon is having difficulty resisting the temptation to get involved in northern politics if in twow just as in season jon deliberately steps away from his job as lc of the nw i think hell get involved in stanniss campaign if he takes the same kind of military leadership role as in the show perhaps if stannis is injured then he could be the one to take winterfell instead of stannis in this case i could see the northern lords proclaiming him king in the north just as in the show regardless of attitudes towards bastards the northern lords are desperate for a stark in charge preferably an adult male stark and best of all a stark who looks and acts like ned if robbs will shows up then most objections would melt away in short i think the show has killed stannis off too soon and theyve taken sansa away from her relative safety in the vale but i dont think theyve made up the plotline where jon becomes king in the north i always thought the story was leading in that direction
asoiaf,removed,i simply want the angrier post award to be called all the fucking chickens or alternatively the what the fucks a lommy award

asoiaf,removed,nah the ironborn were always meant to become important at least since book the dornish im less sure about but i think they were always meant to segue into aegons plot once grrm had it firmly laid out on his mind its plots like the high septon arya in braavos and daenerys staying in meereen that he expanded on more
asoiaf,removed,mine was to masterbate
asoiaf,removed,i got you but tbh you have to admit this post is absolute garbage
asoiaf,removed,it wont come out until after the trump regime
asoiaf,removed,brandon the builder is clearly trump made a name for himself w real estate investments storms end winterfell who knows what else built the wall to keep illegal immigrants out made his family into a brand name that has lasted from the age of heroes all the way through the age of ultron

asoiaf,removed,yeah dumb thread op
asoiaf,removed,if youre counting deadwood as bad you are retarded
asoiaf,removed,alright settle down there sarge knowing the ending to a story understanding the themes of a story one wouldnt understand the ending to space odyssey if one had it recapped after watching half the movie it would simply be a shitty ending if asoiaf ended with a just war im getting the impression that theres a lot of shit were not told about the others and i have a very hard time believing that all of this will simply amount to goodie humans vs baddie ice dudes
asoiaf,removed,your title is a spoiler you dumbass
asoiaf,removed,sorry preston i know you post here but i thnk your a moron
asoiaf,removed,shut up ignorant take wise ass at least we get content with the season likely more than well ever get from the books
asoiaf,removed,seriously all these people chiming in as i liked season what the fuck what is there to like about spending an hour talking about a zombie thats splashing around at the bottom of the well then sending someone down to try to lasso it like a goddamn retard even if they got it out would you drink that water its been bleeding and pussing and beingazombieing in for god knows how long would you just kill it and board up the well takes minute then do something interesting that might actually matter it makes no goddamn sense no thought or action expressed by anyone that entire season makes any goddamn sense whatsoever if you liked that season you would drink that water then youd turn into a zombie and everyone else would kill your ass then no one else would be sad because youre fucking dumb
asoiaf,removed,yeah hes just an arrogant bastard who is not half as smart as he thinks he is he got his precious refutal of rlj wrong so now hes grasping at even more pathetic straws
asoiaf,removed,i couldnt care less asoiaf has been almost completely ruined i find it hard to believe that what has been shown on tv is the exact idea grrm had for his story at this point its no longer a story written by grrm but a story cowritten by grrm and the got writers at this point even if grrm does release winds of winter i dont think ill be excited for it its all been bastardized
asoiaf,removed,rwatchitfortheplot nsfw

asoiaf,removed,she was alright is something youd say if you would hit it and i wouldnt
asoiaf,removed,of course you do your other posts indicate youre one of these people who thinks dark and depressing and violent is somehow great and is itself a sign of merit but you dont understand the story or martin martin misleads this is how he got the undeserved rep as a trope subverter he sacrifices pawns and his kings and queens move on he built his rep as a guy wholl kill anybody on a bunch of characters who werent main characters ned robb the baratheons tywin joff supporting character after supporting character dies to create a false impression of any character can die at any time no they cant and itll probably prove the same with the resurrections beric cat tho i would argue neither cat nor beric lost anything due to dying and being resurrected beric died over and over and over again and lost only cumulatively cat went mad and changed prior to dying then this combined with her physical gruesomeness to the the circumstances of her death combine to trick the reader into thinking shes had a postdeath personality change gregor are nobodies jon is the man you think hes going to make his main character a pov character an unrecognizable monster thing who lacks the personality and memories of the character weve come to know why would he do that i mean why not stop and think why you want everybody to be so damaged what a weird thing to want hes not damaged enough everyone else is horribly damaged why not him are you seriously complaining that youre not getting your fill of damagedness from this story world maybe theon can cut his cock off again and forget his name for you would that make you happy you weird sadist
asoiaf,removed,im not going to say what the leaks are since theyre not allowed here but i will tell you that they exist regarding this scene so if youre curious just pm me
asoiaf,removed,he abandoned his king during a battle
asoiaf,removed,bitterness is oozing out of him hes so salty that his bs theories are being shot down one by one
asoiaf,removed,attacking other user will do boss
asoiaf,removed,huh show littlefinger just made a big deal of giving a falcon to lord arryn
asoiaf,removed,what i would give to be that bucket
asoiaf,removed,well there are a lot of spoilers out there saying that tommen kills himself which might make sense if things go to shit and he feels to blame for it or his mom turns on him when she realizes it was a lie i dont think margery will die maybe kevan and pycelle maybe loras but i dont think those things will be anything to do with this situation directly
asoiaf,removed,i would absolutely agree with you if not for the ian mcshane interview that literally spoiled it its definitely happening in the show books are another story and i could see it going multiple ways
asoiaf,removed,what did he say its deleted
asoiaf,removed,youre breaking the boring policy dont be boring
asoiaf,removed,preston loves fantasy so much he lives in one of his own creation
asoiaf,removed,oops you have acok info in an agot post this is how to format those spoilers s your comment will look like this s your comment
asoiaf,removed,whoops that part you mentions is from adwd please use this formatting s adwd info
asoiaf,removed,littlefingers lf trump confirmed
asoiaf,removed,thats cos the nutcase still believes it
asoiaf,removed,right so you seem to agree with me on what he is doing you just dont realize that is subverting chekhovs gun by not making all of those details obvious which is usually what happens in a lot of stories even good stories where if the narrator describes something you know it is only being mentioned because it will have a large part to play later on i disagree that that can be considered subversion hes subverting expectations but the idea that hes subverting the dramatic principal itself is retarded
asoiaf,removed,they will find hillarys email server down there
asoiaf,removed,just like her vagina
asoiaf,removed,that makes sense that loras would be the faiths champion
asoiaf,removed,i was not arguing with fatwalda just nerding out about certain aspects of data collection it was a fun survey but obviously there is a dissonance between the answers then and the reality now far from shitting on the old survey i would like to see another midseason survey to see howwhy things have changed were people overly optimistic about twow coming out did we overestimate our willingness to avoid spoilers i am unfamiliar with the massive deletion of threads for having the wrong spoiler tags can you provide some evidence back up that claim if it happens at all i would bet that it mostly involves posts with spoiler levels being too low good luck on your crusade to convince people that they are wrong to use the spoiler tags of they prefer
asoiaf,removed,didnt mean to be like that sorry man
asoiaf,removed,i predict a white walker centered episode their story of originrelation to cotf etc
asoiaf,removed,beyond the fact he did the tales of dunk and egg why would he be the one to get picked roy dotrice isnt dead yet and his recordings were popular enough that when someone else did book enough people complained they made another one with him if they change it i assume theyd tap someone with more show prestige than that as a way to increase sale but probably someone who plays a dead character like the guy above said pedro pascal would be a better option and in that case it would be much easier to masturbate to the books than with either lloyd or dotrice
asoiaf,removed,oh they classified hillary clinton as a targaryen wtf strike
asoiaf,removed,i dont really give a fuck my man
asoiaf,removed,you havent even seen it yet breathe
asoiaf,removed,could be the thing to cause dany to fly into the red keep with drogon and burn it down sigh if only
asoiaf,removed,the lannisters dont have the reach the spoilers are that after they sack highgarden dany annihilates the lannister army in battle house tyrell is kaput but the reach is hers again
asoiaf,removed,the spoilers are suggesting that the reach isnt going to remain united apparently some reach lords arent going to like aligning with foreign invaders and dornish
asoiaf,removed,nah but cats pov mostly in acok are pretty amazing in their empathy levels you really feel for her
asoiaf,removed,meanwhile season in almost every list for best tv of
asoiaf,removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of months to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete id dont forget to add the time options after the of
asoiaf,removed,such sad foreshadowing and it does show the connection between the starks and winterfell this is their home it will be so uplifting to finally have a stark in winterfell when the line of the red kings has ended but this does show a repeating of mistakes of the past again lord stark goes south at a kings bidding again he is unjustly murdered by a tyrant this is partially why the north tried to secede from the it it looked like those southron kings were no friends to the starks again murdering the norths ruler but hopefully a brighter future can be forged in the end despite the impending doom of kl and the it i hope neds bones are returned to lie beside his family and by the end a stark will sit in winterfell once more rereading this series is so wonderful you really pick up and understand more about why grrm takes so long to write theres such heart to the story with short and sad moments oft around the starks and winterfell
asoiaf,removed,tyrion does call joffrey aerys iii at one point as rodrik says archmaester rigney once wrote that history is a wheel for the nature of man is fundamentally unchanging what has happened before will perforce happen again he said hopefully by the ending people will move on from the mistakes of the past tyrion and dany will reject their cruel fathers legacy and go to save the world from the others likewise sams reading will help save westeros while his brutal violenceloving father will fall the greedy mace tyrell will die and his children will help forge a better future asha will help advance the iron islands unlike her regressive and stupid father being the true heir of her fathers father quellon and her uncle rodrik harlaw the legacy of ned stark will be passed on by his children hopefully edric will be helped to become a good king by davos whose kindness will guide the new kingdoms to a brighter future
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,never that is just plain stulid
asoiaf,removed,its a penis joke but its actually a bluff i actually have a small penis or do i
asoiaf,removed,theres a really similar scene with stannis mel and davos i think its in the season finale
asoiaf,removed,he thought he would make it to oldtown alive he should have seen that jon snow wouldnt have known he would die fire consumes targaryen house words ice preserves he may have lived another year or two at the wall
asoiaf,removed,this is getting tiring they accepted her at the time because the king didnt had any male heirs so the moment he had a male heir succession dictates that is his birthright so then why did they accept her at all the great council of had already established that an uncle could come before a niece and viserys had a younger brother daemon and where did i said otherwise if i could draw i would so maybe just maybe youd understand the very simple thing im explaining to you but since i cant i will stop wasting my time with you now since its clear you just really dont want to see it you arent even debating a point youve been proven wrong and want to remain wrong it wont stop me from correcting your wrongness or that exact reason a monarch is not the head of a house he is the head of in this case seven kingdoms there must be rules to protect the crown but im sure you will also have trouble grasping this very simple concept rules that a king can choose to heed or not george himself says succession isnt ironclad well the short answer is that the laws of inheritance in the seven kingdoms are modelled on those in real medieval history which is to say they were vague uncodified subject to varying interpertations and often contradictory there are no clear cut answers either in westeros or in real medieval history things were often decided on a case by case basis a case might set a precedent for later cases but as often as not the precedents conflicted as much as the claims httpwwwwesterosorgcitadelssmentrythehornwoodinheritanceandthewhents
asoiaf,removed,im actually reading his books and having the unfortunate annoyance of explaining them to you yes he says succession is not ironclad and im sure we are seeing on his latest books the shift but so far the books tells us that succession even if challenged ends up being followed through look im not denying that succession can be challenged anything can what im saying is that so far even when challenged they end up following it and not simply the whims of a king or another thats all
asoiaf,removed,s i subscribe to the theory that the gods of planetos are real coming back and a war is coming the dragons are a valuable weapon in that war the dragons are stirring because theyve just woken up and theyre coming back under rhllor the deep ones will come under the drowned god the children and maybe others under the old gods the seven idk
asoiaf,removed,beepbeep im a bot your comment seems sad to us cheer up have a ps this bot is powered by ai
asoiaf,removed,melisandre glamored but you know the truth mirri maz duur septa unella the shame lady
asoiaf,removed,the original reek yezzan zo qaggaz immensely fat yunkish dude that bought tyrion jbear etc ralf kenning ironborn captain that theon finds rotting alive at moat cailin all shall be at their peak vileness when the selection is made
asoiaf,removed,isil and mexican cartel members are not evil theyre men doing what they believe is right trying to change the world for the better or get ahead in the world and better their own situations or just get by in the environment they live in and were raised in yes they kill people killing ≠ evil remember the good guys i mean opponents of isil theyre not good anymore than their opponents are evil kill too
asoiaf,removed,fuck off you are the dumb one vic is great
asoiaf,removed,euron can be a big obstacle for dany at least in the books not sure if show euron has dragonbinder
asoiaf,removed,being fair herethat water dancer was way better than anyone else present including jorah guy just got unlucky
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,he didnt say he was present he did not a dance with dragons ser barristans pov the kingbreaker but asharas daughter had been stillborn and his fair lady had thrown herself from a tower soon after mad with grief for the child she had lost and perhaps for the man who had dishonored her at harrenhal as well she died never knowing that ser barristan had loved her how could she he was a knight of the kingsguard sworn to celibacy no good could have come from telling her his feelings no good came from silence either if i had unhorsed rhaegar and crowned ashara queen of love and beauty might she have looked to me instead of stark he was relating the same story everyone else heard which if you were to go on a secret exile or into hiding etc would you not want there to be a backstory you dont know a whole lot it would seem
asoiaf,removed,you probably should before the trolls start suggesting you take a long walk off a short balcony its just a story nobody hates bran because hes crippled bran doesnt have feelings that can be hurt bran cant think about anything bran doesnt exist hes a character in a madeup story to take someones thoughts about a fictional characters usefulness in a specific plot element and extrapolate from that those same people considering realworld people as useless to society and bring spending to the government suggests you may need to look up the definition of the word fiction
asoiaf,removed,you should you are taking it way too seriously i havent read once that people hate bran because hes cripple if they hate him its because they find his chaptersscenes boring but never once have i ever seen something along the lines of fuck bran because hes crippled
asoiaf,removed,nobody takes you seriously you still sound like a twat though
asoiaf,removed,i can see that you have missed the fucking point of the series enjoy oblivion you selfconcerned firstworld shit eater
asoiaf,removed,youre correct the people downvoting you are fucking idiots
asoiaf,removed,donald of house trump
asoiaf,removed,do you honestly feel funny when you make stupid comments like this christ
asoiaf,removed,holy shit you are ignorant the kingship of the north was dissolved after robbs death and the north rejoined the seven kingdoms after the boltons defeat by jon there was a second secession with them naming him king in the north your argument is like saying daenerys is the rightful heir not robert jon took back the north by conquest and has the support of the lords if bran comes back they wont give a shit because jon has fought and bled with them get the fuck out of here with your southron notions on succession
asoiaf,removed,thats like your opinion cunt no valid points made yet sorry
asoiaf,removed,an idiot who cant read lol
asoiaf,removed,you wont be missed
asoiaf,removed,planetos is sexist have you read the series at all you realize this is a medieval fantasy right
asoiaf,removed,quick get in your safe space someone holds an opinion different than yours
asoiaf,removed,what is rude about it
asoiaf,removed,i dont believe at any point i made that excuse i only pointed out the inconsistencies in the modding which were ratified after i pointed it out just so we are crystal clear rule violation dont be condescending
asoiaf,removed,i didnt realize linda and elio had new usernames
asoiaf,removed,her first intercourse with khal drogo is consensual stopped reading there this is a garbage opinion and it needs to be stopped she says no repeatedly and drogo just keeps going until she stops saying no shes been fucking sold to a terrifying warlord its not an indictment of drogos character or grrms writingit makes sense given the time period and the situation but going out of your way to act like the show changed it to a rape is fucking awful
asoiaf,removed,well danny is raped repeatedly after the first time by kahl drogo the jaime and cercei scene was not intended to be a rape george is not that good of an historian because the age thing is more of a common myth but it is his universe so he can make up his own rules and customs and the books are way more sexual than the show is what is happening in the books would make got a proper porn
asoiaf,removed,bullshit they are not that sexually explicit i had to watch asha be into rapeplay and talk about her cunt becoming the world
asoiaf,removed,youre not done yet
asoiaf,removed,we really need twow to come out
asoiaf,removed,did preston jacobs write this
asoiaf,removed,youre the kind of person i would gladly sell to slavers
asoiaf,removed,you know who didnt underestimate him varys
asoiaf,removed,wow not even shireen was burned that bad
asoiaf,removed,thats got nothing to do with the irrefutable facts i just posted coward asoiaf might be a bit too much for your mind to handle
asoiaf,removed,the one creepy fucking constant from the books and show both is littlefingers obsession with sansa in the books its utterly horrifying for me hes projecting the love he had for cat onto her daughter as sort of a consolation prize and in the show even though aiden gillen is a fantastic actor it still creeps me the fuck out the way he is around her
asoiaf,removed,i hear there is going to be a wall built soon by king trump
asoiaf,removed,thats kinda the point
asoiaf,removed,got nothing to do today
asoiaf,removed,who dares to question our ancient ways we take what is ours with torrent and stream
asoiaf,removed,i agree hes an asshole honestly hes like why are you guys bugging me about this book who cares when it comes out leave me alone well if you didnt hype everyone up on multiple occasions about the book coming out it wouldnt be so bad mr martin he did the same thing with adwd youd think hed know better by winds of winter but he hyped everyone up and said it will be out withina few months now we are going to be going on two years after that him bitching about people bitching at him well he deserves it because he got everyone on the edge of their seats everyone rereading the series just so they can be caught up with the new book then nothing at all not a word except for itll be done when its done stop all your bitching im not your bitch hheeeeheehehehehe very very annoying
asoiaf,removed,i believe specterace just got served
asoiaf,removed,seems like youre the crazy one here
asoiaf,removed,demanding little cant arent we
asoiaf,removed,uh no the very fact that it never says it says it never happened in the show
asoiaf,removed,rip george
asoiaf,removed,expecting george to hold up his end of the bargain isnt being entitled were the ones who spend our money on the books when he wrote released the first book twenty one years ago he asked us to stay invested in his story he has a responsibility to finish the series if he doesnt we spent our money on a lie i wouldnt have bothered to buy the books and the world of ice and fire if i knew it wasnt going to be completed us book fans are extremely loyal weve stayed invested even though the books will be spoiled by the tv show even though he is either one of the slowest or the laziest writers in history and offers zero updates or blatant lies meanwhile back at the wall he averages less words per day than this paragraph which took me a few minuets write
asoiaf,removed,yeah its spoiled a lot since aegon isnt in it i assume hes a pretender and isnt important it spoiled johns resurrection even though we knew it was coming same for rlj spoiled how dany gets to westeros spoiled tyrions arc spoiled hodor spoiled cold hands spoiled tommen margery high sparrow storylines to be honest im done with the books grrm isnt a particularly good writer so the joy of the books was the plot and world building the show has passed him in both im disappointed in grrm and honestly think he knows his masterpiece has been spoiled by his own poor planning and he doesnt expect to finish the series i doubt we ever see book seven and barely have hope for twow
asoiaf,removed,boo hoo
asoiaf,removed,for someone with your attitude id say its a foregone conclusion
asoiaf,removed,just beause its not fast enough for the entitled pricks its not fast enough for his publishers editors or himself either
asoiaf,removed,i am sick and fucking tired of attitudes like yours op in fact i would bet half the reason grrm is taking so long to write the last books is because millions of people are only seeing the worst in him and his writing habits that weighs on a person being disciplined doesnt require other people believing in you but by fucking god it helps i choose to believe in him because for one thing he owes me nothing and he certainly doesnt own it to me in an kind of time frame but also because believing in him may help but its a hell of a lot better than what youre doing
asoiaf,removed,just hoping old george survives
asoiaf,removed,because hes old and looks like hes about to die if he dies it will never get finished grrm doesnt believe in letting other people touch his stuff and has worked with a lawyer to ensure it we may never even get a summary of the final stoeylines jon for instance hes theorized to be stark in winterfell stark on the it targ on the it lc of nights watch again the wall stands the wall falls ww defeated forever sealed away reached truce or kill all humans jon married to sansa arya dany val no one theres so many possible endings for each character
asoiaf,removed,it takes longer because he has difficulties wrapping the whole thing up martin himself confessed this years ago when he pitched the story to the publisher please do your research before wildly speculating into the sunset
asoiaf,removed,because we crows of the pessimist order know that grrms time draws shorter on this realm
asoiaf,removed,so what hes taken increasingly long for subpar books screw him
asoiaf,removed,yes but lindas straightup crazy so he needs new people shes verbally abusive to fans wont read or watch anything to do with s the red wedding and refuses to admit when shes wrong
asoiaf,removed,i wonder if he will be able to live long enough to finish the series maybe if he cut back on eating and started working out and stopped putting such mouthwatering descriptions of food in his books it would prolong his life it would make sense because the next books are supposed to take place in winter when the realm will be in a mass famine
asoiaf,removed,final fuck you to the planet with be georges death in the next few days
asoiaf,removed,idk how anybody can make excuses for grrm hes just plain ol lazy
asoiaf,removed,he will die before dec watch
asoiaf,removed,try httplibgenio
asoiaf,removed,dae fuck xd
asoiaf,removed,rip
asoiaf,removed,ask the people speculating hes just not writing it because he doesnt have to youre just one of those people who are scared of discussion against your view so you use this bullshit approach
asoiaf,removed,piece together the last years of nab entries and compare them to the bloggings of writers like abercrombie or erikson it´s quite a revelation if you are not in abject denial
asoiaf,removed,benjen would be amazing get to see everything that happens to him on his last ranging but i would love robb chapters especially if set during acok and asos
asoiaf,removed,but havent we seen that cersei is an awful awful human being and she didnt develop into evil she was born that way from being a kid and torturing tyrion and probably killing her friend cersei is one of the few true monsters in the book
asoiaf,removed,they ride horses like a man would arya has needle and lyanna would have carried a sword if she was allowed to do so despite aryas turn into a serial killer she likes flowers like other girls and who knows maybe if arya had the opportunity to hear rhaegar singing she might have liked it i believe george is writing lyanna trough arya no secret there
asoiaf,removed,the prevalent painkiller i dont get how this is meaningful what else is a woman dying of childbirth and a man dying of getting gored going to ask for
asoiaf,removed,just because it isnt in the books doesnt mean its not necessarily true the picture that is drawn of robert from that scene where he says he cant remember her is still in line with robert in the books in the books not the show ned recalls lyanna saying she doesnt want to marry robert because hell never keep to one bed she knew that robert was a womanizer robert thinks of her as the love of his life who loved him would have had babies with him and been everything he wanted out of life but she didnt love him she didnt want to be with him and when rhaegar came into the picture she fell in love with him instead and robert never knew lyanna was a fantasy and even if he could remember her face the point here is that he never spent real quality time with her they never knew each other not really maester aemon talks about remembering his lovers face at the ripe old age of or whatever but robert cant remember lyanna its because they were never really together and robert never really knew her thats the point being made
asoiaf,removed,but we wouldnt have hispanics if it werent for the moorsand who but trump and his followers really hate mexicans and that type
asoiaf,removed,go back to fanfictionnet or rgameofthrones
asoiaf,removed,is the part about euron capturing someone a set leak if yes then the spoiler scope for this thread should be spoilers production
asoiaf,removed,make westeros great again brandon stark
asoiaf,removed,so they are palantirs
asoiaf,removed,he took a bunch of useless mouths into a castle with a threat of a siege looming thus ensuring that theyd all starve faster if tywin invested the castle stupid move the fearful smallfolk were safer in the field he also lost the war of the kings for robb so theres that bugger edmure with a spear
asoiaf,removed,the wife of the original lord has no claim on the title she can act as the lady but only until their child comes of age their only power comes from their children without it they are nothing this is why cersei has to forcibly take power in she can no longer be considered the queen regent so even if they remarry the first child is still the rightful heir if the new husband tries to kill the son all that would happen is that the succession would go back a step so if the original lord has a brother then he would become the lord if the brother is dead it goes to his children ect in no situation does the new child become the heir because they have no claim to the title
asoiaf,removed,yeah i always thought that the retard cake goes to robb
asoiaf,removed,theres a theory that says bran will rape meera via summer could still happen in the books
asoiaf,removed,im happy trump will be our president stophitlery
asoiaf,removed,tbf most of the people that come here posting theories either dont seem to be actually reading the bookswatching the show or have extremely poor reasoning skills
asoiaf,removed,theyre both jokes tbh and so are you apparently
asoiaf,removed,its easier if you dislike sansa
asoiaf,removed,i am not surprised at all about this or the other announcement grrm is a shit person who somehow managed to start a really good story out of the several dozen that suck rotten zombie ball
asoiaf,removed,george gives a whopping shit about finishing these books it seems i mean we had tomes of world building with relatively little movement in terms of plot youd think years is enough time to get your shit together and start converging these storylines even if you took months off at a time to do tours and cherish your new found success but fuck everyone who expects an ending i mean thats what i do when i pick up a book i diddle fuck through it and dont expect closure to the story fuck my aching ass
asoiaf,removed,the ultimate whatever edition is going for a measly what the actual fuck wasnt that long ago you could buy george for that money

asoiaf,removed,many have already pointed out that the first son would remain the heir which is correct more generally the line of succession under agnaticcognatic primogeniture the most prevalent form of succession practice during the middle ages originates from the last legal ruler agnaticcognatic basically means that male heirs are preferred over female ones and primogeniture that the eldest heir is first in line so if a lord has two sons and a daughter the eldest son is the primary heir the younger son is the secondary heir and the daughter is third in line even if the daughter is older than either of the sons this is illustrated by the royal baratheonlannister house in asoiaf joffrey is the eldest and thus first in line tommen is the youngest yet he has preference over myrcella as he is a boy the dornish laws are purely cognatic meaning that eldest heir inherits regardless of gender if a lord has no direct descendants the line of succession is still derived from him in that case his eldest brother would inherit if the eldest brother is also dead the eldest of his sons the original lords eldest nephew by his eldest son would inherit inherits followed by his younger sons heres where it gets a bit messy because at least in practice the pattern wasnt quite followed if the lords eldest brother had a daughter and the lord also had younger brothers legally you might expect the daughter to take precedent but in most cases the younger brother did as far as i am aware and it gets really messy if the original lord had no kids and two younger sisters in such a case the younger of the sisters could sometimes take precedent if she had a son and the elder sister didnt there is no logic explanation for that at all of course in reality all this didnt necessarily mean much if a younger son asoiaf illustration renly had more swords at his disposal for example through a more favourable marriage than his older brother andor had influence at the court or with the church he could simply overthrow his brother and justify it by having his brother declared insane a traitor or have him excommunicated i think this is one of grrms key points in asoiaf there may be laws but if youre strong enough they dont really apply power resides where men believe it resides if more men believe that it resides with an illegitimate ruler he is not illegimate at all

asoiaf,removed,you never know meera might decide she wants to ride bran anyway if grrm gets horny when hes writing one day he could throw it in there similar to how he writes ridiculous fucking feasts universally involving nominal quantities of motherfucking pease when hes hungry
asoiaf,removed,quaithe is pretty much correct except the first son is not the heir he is the lord his mother may be ruling but the power is vested in her temporarily she can become regent but she never rules in her own right she rules only while her child is too young to make decisions for himself say a leader of a house marries a lady and they have an heir the lord of the house then dies so the lady presumes to rule before the heir comes of age now a new lord comes and marries that lady and they have a son is their son the new heir or is the first son still the heir for example joffrey was king he was crowned immediately after robert died he was the king he didnt have an extended period where he was heir he was crowned quickly thereafter even though he was too young to rule cersei became queen regent but not queen regnant which is why she has pretty much zero legitimate claim to the throne and why in the show her position is beyond shaky
asoiaf,removed,because tommen is not old enough to get her pregnant
asoiaf,removed,with all due respect its none of your business what i do i wanted to see who gets triggered first anyone would come to the same conclusion once they analyze the show i said the writing doesnt make sense not that i hate the show could it be that youve become a fanboy who gets triggered by criticism
asoiaf,removed,sorry i didnt mean to offend you in your safe space
asoiaf,removed,this is one of those threads that immediately makes me say we need a new book people
asoiaf,removed,hes probably still reeling after the trump victory all these liberals in shambles im sure hes one of them
asoiaf,removed,no one gives a shit about your spawn
asoiaf,removed,benjen rescues meera and bran his hands are warm bran watches ned and bobby b growing up in the vale dany filler episode walking and talking about her great plans while drogon flies overhead blood fire death to all sams dad is the generic ass hes been portrayed as but his moms nice dinner goes as expected tommen convinces the hs to release margery without a walk of shame we dont find out what he gave up but its implied hes being played loras joins the faith so with margery released and loras at least out of a dungeon the tyrells arent looking to fight anymore ayra overhears the next stop for the acting group is the twins and tries to join them but its part of the fm test and has to run for her life manages to sneak on a ship leaving for parts unknown as cersei is ranting about how she had to do the walk of shame while margery doesnt qyburn informs her the faith has picked their champion cut to shot of shadowy figure digging graves with somebody off screen telling him he must leave for kings landing

asoiaf,removed,this the hillary oig report and a bernie vs trump debate areaking this like the best week ever

asoiaf,removed,please err on the side of courtesy people you can really hurt someone if you dont i just want to say that im new here and in response to a video link i posted i got comments calling me a karma gold or obsidian whore and a classhole and claiming that my link was a repost and my title clickbait i searched asoiaf before posting and found nothing like this video i think the person who said that mine was a repost may have been referring to a text interview after he wrote that though others took his word for it that my link was a repost in any case i did my best to search asoiaf before posting so that i would not be submitting anything redundant also my title which was about kristian nairn discussing hodors death was utterly sincere i found that interview deeply moving i have been doing my best to fit in here and to contribute in meaningful ways to discussions about a fictional world which i am passionately exploring i was so thrilled to discover this community this experience however makes me want to leave reddit altogether forever i have never been called any kind of whore before and i do not deserve the treatment ive gotten here i feel like ive been kicked or spat upon i have deleted the post in question and doubt very much that i will ever have the courage to post again
asoiaf,removed,is the wolf super pack mentioned in the show its mentioned a lot in feast for crows but i dont think ive heard anything about it show wise
asoiaf,removed,is your brain as smallas your dick

asoiaf,removed,damphair oh i loved learning about the iron islands and seeing the kingsmoot but i just disliked this drowned aeron greyjoy
asoiaf,removed,wow somebody pissed in your wheaties it was a cool scene in a tv show chill
asoiaf,removed,are you implying that all nonfeminists are misogynists thats quite childish
asoiaf,removed,as opposed to the antishow jerk when and were airing u mad
asoiaf,removed,httpsgfycatcominbornsmallfly
asoiaf,removed,its a stupid theory as in it literally requires you to think howland reed is mentally unstable or mentally retarded
asoiaf,removed,where were you when stupid feminists took over rasoiaf
asoiaf,removed,weve already got pycelle for that
asoiaf,removed,so was trump
asoiaf,removed,from my perspective the starks are evil
asoiaf,removed,ah yes circlejerk mondays
asoiaf,removed,not the queen the khaleesi
asoiaf,removed,i should stay put i should stay put i should stay put what leaks do you mean
asoiaf,removed,why are you even watching the show it has clearly started to go a separate way to the books if this isnt what you like stop watching quit notching and wait for twow to come out otherwise just enjoy the show for what it is it isnt and never has been a direct adaption of the novels
asoiaf,removed,wait who is the troll here
asoiaf,removed,if drogon flies in to save the day youd all bitch about that too uhhh dany never does anything herself always relying on the dragon ex machina to get her out of trouble blah blah plot armour blah blah mary sue blah blah blah
asoiaf,removed,no it wasnt dont be an idiot
asoiaf,removed,am i the only one picking up on some seriously sexist overtones from everything the op says youre not the only idiot here so probably not the last significant thing she did was have sex with drogon he said it because its the last thing that she alone accomplished without the help of anyone else she took the initiative and took control during sex on a man three times her size that could snap her like a twig or just rape her to death his name was also drogo drogons the dragon cersei is a high octane cunt explain how saying cersei is a massive cunt mysoginist are you fucking real now after all the shit cersei pulled on other people calling her an high octane cunt makes op a mysoginist normally i hate doing this because it makes other people feel like i am invalidating their argument ask yourself if you would have these same criticisms if dany was a male ramsay is hated because reality doesnt apply to him and everything goes right and there are no negative consequences so yes what about taking meereen and yunkai those actions were accomplished by her soldiers but they were commanded by her wow how impressive so what makes her strong is saying go conquer x city huh powerful how she conquered meereen by being lucky that one of the captains of the second sons fell in love with her and betrayed his companions thats luck the military tactics to infiltrate meereen not done or thought by her she is surrounded by people who do her work for her and she reaps the benefits this post just screams intimidated by powerful women and your post screams brain damage
asoiaf,removed,what he seems to be pointed out is that if dany were a man and won it via swordfightpowerstrength would it have been different than her killing them with wit depends jaime or jon putting up a good believable fight and winning honestly i doubt either could win such fight i might believe it from ser barristan if he hadnt been trashed by dd shirtless ramsay grinning with a pair of knives unearned cmon
asoiaf,removed,it helps a lot that she is portrayed by a shitty actress
asoiaf,removed,careful youre going to trigger some people with that level of thinking
asoiaf,removed,what happened then did benjen warg into a snapping turtle and kill him
asoiaf,removed,get out of here with that bullshit just because doesnt like someone that happens to be a woman doesnt mean its because theyre a woman claiming sexism is cheap and pathetic
asoiaf,removed,thats the reason why i hate arguing this type of shit on reddit nowhere did i ever say that slavery was okay i hate this mandatory shitshow of people needing to justify and clarify themselves because some douchebag goes the loweffort route of just accusing someone of supporting slavery if youre not capable of putting their actions into the perspective of their world and instead argue from the perspective of century morals then youre going to have a really bad time reading historicaldark fantasy in years vegetarianism might be standard our descendants might think that we were an extremely barbaric society that we massbred animals for consumption if one of those people would time travel into the past and talk to a vegetarian that lives today he would accuse him of not standing up for all those animals not doing more not preventing the murder of all those innocent creatures and even accuse a person who actively opposed the consumption of meat of being as guilty as anyone who consumes meat what that person doesnt realize is that its easy for him to say that shit he lives in a society where being vegetarian is completely normal change takes time socioplotical shifts can take centuries almost all of recorded human history includes slavery most of the greatest empires were built on the back of slaves it took thousands of years for slavery to be considered a serious societal problem before the concept of universal human rights was even considered slavery isnt even abolished now it still exists up to this day in several different countries hurp durp just kill the slave owners is a knee jerk reaction that can only be considered just by people who like to take the moral highground introduce an antislave law and only punish those that continue to break the law after it was instated dont retroactively punish an entire class of citizens of year new empire who were born into their lives in a society where slavery is normalized because you consider their actions barbaric if they refuse to change you can punish them but punishing them without at least giving them a chance to progress as a society shows that you believe the reason they did was they did wasnt out of ignorance but because they are inherently evil
asoiaf,removed,tldr im a whiner
asoiaf,removed,are you telling me that the bloodriders of those khals arent about to murder daenerys you know the men sworn to live and die by their khal blood of his blood no one is going to murder the defenseless girl in retribution from a culture that is notorious for murder and rape sure yeah great writing you can look at the upvotes on this post and tell that critical thought is dying and the lowest common denominator is taking hold of the got demographic
asoiaf,removed,upvote for high octane cunt
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,people who hate on dany have always been and will be cunts no valid excuses dont like her cuz hes annoying fine dont like her because she is a bad ruler like you know shit
asoiaf,removed,no the orcs went on to become black people in africa
asoiaf,removed,but the argument is whether we observers with century morals view them as evil which we most certainly should no we dont for someone or something to be considered evil there needs to be intent we dont think that cats are evil for playing with their food for that exact reason the action itself is cruel and horrific but anyone who grows up in a society where those things are normalized wont just question it because we in the century think its evil you have to understand how cultural relativism works we can condemn someones actions while still understanding why they did what they did there is a reason why someone that grew up in a muslim culture wont randomly turn into a christian or why a christian doesnt randomly turn into a muslim some do but most dont because children are impressionable and learn from their parents who got taught the exact same thing by theirs as a westerosi ruler in her culture it is her right to kill anyone she believed to have done wrong what a load of crooked horseshit some of her advisors gave her a perspective on that subject that none of the slave owners have ever gotten barristan specifically advises her against public executions of slave owners and urges her to give anyone who broke the law a fair trial your understanding of westerosi culture is as terrible as your understanding of human history the fact that in a previous post you pretended as if the slave owners in the century just figured out by themselves to eventually abolish slavery is a pretty clear indication of that hundreds of thousands died families were torn apart innocents had to suffer no one fucking figured it out on their own thats not how any sociopolitical change ever worked and ever will work were not the fucking singularity one mind collectively working towards a better future
asoiaf,removed,except she did drogo asked her for consent and she gave it it was actually a pretty nice parallel to his rough side actually if you remember dany actually ended up initiating proceedings it might be statuary rape sure but she did give consent and theres nothing to suggest drogo wouldve raped her
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,no one said she didnt
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,how about when armed and armourclad iron islanders were scared away by a small number of angry dogs you mean when yeah no qualms with that im not going to spend all night trying to talk you out of your boring tired opinions if you dont like the show dont fucking watch it and if you only want to watch so you can get on the internet and complain that it isnt exactly how you want it to be get a hobby
asoiaf,removed,don flurry the bastard son of eddy snark
asoiaf,removed,its almost like you shared that opinion just so you could be a smartass to the first person who commented on it
asoiaf,removed,my favorite editor his was a picture of it and it went like this i fooked a bear once yeah and a million twinks
asoiaf,removed,read the thread do you really not see a pattern youre focusing on this one thread to make it seem like youre right and im exaggerating but you have to see the context i mean you cant be thatblindcan you
asoiaf,removed,youre not critiquing youre just saying this is shit so shut the fuck up about interns being hired just because people dont fucking agree with you
asoiaf,removed,rretiredgif
asoiaf,removed,nah man you probably just came off just as whiny in your other comments as you do here you see female characters with larger roles and immediately freak out and assume it just has to be because of some agenda and theres no way dd just thought it was the most interesting way to adapt the story we dont get any of lady stoneheart in the show sure seems like shed be used if there was some huge badass female agenda in the show dacey mormont is a member of robb starks personal guard in the books doesnt even appear in the show maybe try to make a wellreasoned post instead of casting yourself as a crusader for truth against the evil feminism card
asoiaf,removed,you need to change the affc spoiler to adwd just fyi but its been approved
asoiaf,removed,tywin was a tactician and a politician dany just has a vagina and deus ex machina dragons this is why she was only enjoyable in the first book after that she is a cocky little piece of shit for undeserved reasons
asoiaf,removed,there is someone who has leaked some details about season and turned out true he says children of the forest created the others to protect something this is revealed after bran confronts leaf if you want to know more pm me all this will be shown episode
asoiaf,removed,thats why i cant take half of these apologists seriouslythey come up with the most retardedunfitting reasons for why scenario a happens it gets so wearing and boring to hear these excuses over and over again
asoiaf,removed,yeah exactly that sounds horrible the whole thing of being made of the heart of a fallen star is just cheesy as fuck glad it was left out
asoiaf,removed,rpolitics is starting to rally behind donald trump now that its looking more and more like bernies going to be eliminated this is sort of similar
asoiaf,removed,almost none of these points make any fucking sense oh fucking lord you danyshits will do the most absurd mental gymnastics like dear lord how the fuck do you have such a poor understanding since she announced what she was about to do ahead of time her entire plan falls apart if someone happens to be near her not near her to stop her just happens to be near her but she knows this will not happen because plot as opposed to giant torches made of water full of fire that does nothing to dry wood have you ever even tried to light wood on fire with a liquid fuel she fucking tipped the torches onto dirt floors and they practically exploded and she knew they would react like that how since she had never been in the room before and does not have eyes to observe things uh huh so shed experimented to find out that these fucking absurdly deadly torches could be knocked over by gently pushing on them get fucking real a brilliant solution when locked in a room that is on fire is to attack the person who started the fire which remains burning in the room you are in she had no way of ensuring that wouldnt happen zero way to know that once trapped these violent fucking killers wouldnt do everything in their power to take her out with them and instead acted like frightened fucking horses what does this even mean the khals were surrounded by firein what scenario does the building collapse and everything turns out okay for them is it unbelievable that fire burns wood as you mentioned earlier or unbelievable that fire doesnt burn wood to ash instantly hint neither of those things is unusual it is fucking unusual that a nomadic fucking society builds a structure in the heat that is so uniformly thick and sturdy that a burly fucking warlord cant break through it anywhere
asoiaf,removed,when she walked out of drogos pyre with live fucking dragons after not murdering their most prominent leaders the majority of the dothraki still had split away from her the majority would still kill her on fucking site with several prominent ones swearing by it so no mother fucker you are wrong

asoiaf,removed,absolutely there are unfortunately a handful of filthy neckos who will complain about every and all departure from the books yet most of us can see the benefit in doing so grrm has numerous idiot plots and what i mean by idiot plot is this situations in which misunderstandings mistaken identities andor unlikely coincidences drive the plot for grrm its mistaken identities he pathologically abuses this device im so glad the show cut all that shit out arya and jayne pool mance the baby whitebeard even aegon its just frustrating when the audience knows more than the character theyre supposed to be rooting for its hard to get behind an ignorant character the neckos have called ramseys capture of rickon cheap maybe it is but its necessary at least the stakes have been raised as opposed to the books where its just some girl who has no importance whatsoever
asoiaf,removed,im having chicken for lunch and planning to eyefuck every tall blonde in the vicinity what are your lunch plans reddit

asoiaf,removed,you aint lyin this fanbase is all about get hype for every other character arc if this post was made last season it would be about how jon is a badass action hero and daenerys is hanging around doing fuck all i mean like whoever you like but please all you reddity mouthbreathers spare us the pseudo intellectual essays
asoiaf,removed,why people like jon more than daenerys jon isnt a caricature of manhood like daenerys is of a strong woman jon and his storyline is wellwritten and highly compelling daenerys is mediocre dothraki are cool but campy meereen her fucking retarded slavery storyline theyre all fucking awful shes poorly written and an unconvincing unrealistic character hes wellwritten and believable wellbred and trained boy in the north who never fit in joins a supposedly honorable institution where bastards are welcome its an inglorious shitshow and through a very long story he ends up infiltrating an army of wildlings eventually sympathizing with and even befriending them and ascends to lord commander of the nights watch gets capped for doing the right thing revived tormented by his decisions child of a mad king with a corny as fuck brother is a weak little flower gets sold to and raped by a horseriding barbarian falls in love with him he dies she gives birth to dragons she finds qarth she basically destroys qarth she goes to astapor she destroys astapor with their own slaves probably the only cool thing shes ever done she goes to yunkai she takes a mercenary army and the whole city without a single battle she goes to meereen she has another corny as fuck civil war there and then is plagued by civil war against her all the while shes a military genius she finds out the only friend she had spied on her in show time years ago and cant forgive him then she flies away in the middle of an assassination attempt on the back of her dragon then burns down a hut full of grown men in minutes and takes command of all dothraki daenerys has a fucking ridiculously retarded storyline thats why people dont like her if emilia clarke werent beautiful and if there were no tyrion varys jorah or dragons shed be as bad as dorne another hamfistedly profeminist storyline

asoiaf,removed,youre ignorant i hope you die
asoiaf,removed,yeah i just searched for the quote you are correct mormont scarcely seemed to hear him the old man warmed his hands before the fire i sent benjen stark to search after yohn royces son lost on his first ranging the royce boy was green as summer grass yet he insisted on the honor of his own command saying it was his due as a knight i did not wish to offend his lord father so i yielded i sent him out with two men i deemed as good as any in the watch more fool i i still stand by what i said about nobility being better groomed for high positions but this does change my opinion in that theyve got a bit more pull than i originally assumed relative to the average joe at the wall

asoiaf,removed,oh right sorry you have him his overall story and his reasons for writing all figured out get the fuck outta here if you dont want to admit that youre just complaining thats fine but dont do this jesus
asoiaf,removed,jon snow gets killed in a mutiny and is resurcted by melisendra
asoiaf,removed,waah someones making a joke waah mods pls
asoiaf,removed,are you guys seriously going to criticize a fantasy series for not having more than one female character together despite it being written in the if it was written around the time asoiaf was than fair enough but they were very different time nice try though
asoiaf,removed,i have a theory about the night king in the books compared to his presence in the show but given im on my phone and am not entirely sure how to spoiler tag for something more involved than main ill just say that i think the shows nk may have more relevance to the books than we think
asoiaf,removed,numerical had husbands the third was davis dayne sword of the morning dont go refuting claims without research this subreddit is strong because people who post in it care about facts and if darkstar steals dawn that doesnt make him the sword of the morning it just means he has the sword swords dont bestow titles not even in this story hell the entire blackfyre rebellion was fought in this premise
asoiaf,removed,stockholme syndrome the reddit post
asoiaf,removed,tywin lannisters first born and only normal son was put onto the kingsguard where he would serve the targaryens never have children and never inherit anything from his family have you even read the books or seen the show
asoiaf,removed,how is it rude to ask how someone overlooked jaime lannister
asoiaf,removed,your a funny guy what do you actually do you like that scene so you wanna do the same the character was doing yeah i agree that is childlike reasoning look man theres one too many strawmen for me to keep going so im just gonna stop after this you started off by contradicting self saying you didnt enjoy the snow crash sex scenes and then saying you can enjoy any sex scene as long as its well written then you brought to the table some delicious logical fallacies which is kinda bad for your credibility mr psychologist just admit bro you wanna bang yours truly not me of course the year old
asoiaf,removed,this is a shitpost tbh and belongs over at game of thrones theres more karma there anyway
asoiaf,removed,youre an idiot
asoiaf,removed,im just trying to keep this sub free of bad content
asoiaf,removed,id like to read this but the mods have removed it
asoiaf,removed,bc pronounce someone put me out of my misery
asoiaf,removed,i feel like it already started with her murder of the late walder frey
asoiaf,removed,you have eto ask her dragons for their preferred pronoun
asoiaf,removed,bad boys ii was awesome you shut your dirty whore mouth
asoiaf,removed,hi sorry ive removed this post because you have info in this post this is how to format those spoilers s spoiler comment will look like this s spoiler comment let me know when youve added them and ill restore your comment
asoiaf,removed,you can listen to them on youtube
asoiaf,removed,oh honey thats sweet that you think people who call the mods on spoilers make use of logic at all im pretty sure making a thread saying the last character in the narrative of adwd is a period you know the punctuation and youd get banned straight to timbuktu
asoiaf,removed,its elia and aegon learn when to give up
asoiaf,removed,a lot of that is guesswork as there are plenty of characters we never see fight i mean who can say how good salladhor san is some of these matchups were also patently ridiculous eg robb vs shireen i decided that its twohands jaime as thats more interesting im also going to assume that these are duels between prepared people which means that individuals like bran and arya dont really get much credit because their potential deadliness wouldnt be very applicable in such a setting wun wun posed some difficulty because most humans wouldnt even really be able to fight him on the other hand his actual fighting prowess isnt really illustrated much do we ever even see him armed as such i decided that he beats most opponents by default simply because hes too large to defeat in combat except by a human of truly unusual size who has training armor and weapons in their favour that ends up being gregor clegane greg isnt the greatest fighter of the lot but it just happens that two of the people who might beat him are ruled out by being pitted against wun wun early on as weve already seen greg would get beaten by oberyn and probably the notably absent arthur dayne and i think he could lose to sandor and jaime as well khal drogo was a bit of a question mark but i think the fact that drogo fights without armor and presumably without any tricks up his nonexistent sleeves means gregor clegane would narrowly beat him it could probably go either way at least half of those names could be crossed off before it even begins though theres children noble ladies and maesters on there that literally any armed person could effortlessly defeat sort of pointless to even have the likes of cersei maester aemon and lyanna mormont on there this is serious business
asoiaf,removed,how does it not make sense how is what you just said the honest truth in any way shape or form
asoiaf,removed,spent way too much time on i picked based on lots of different criteria my personal favorite actors portrayal of the character writers portrayal of the character whos more relevant to main plot points things like that basically how much i enjoy the character i feel so cliche that i ended with a jontyrion final but my subscribing to jon being azor ahai was actually a significant factor in choosing him time and time again i had no idea how much i liked jorah until i did this i really like iain glens silky smooth voice and i guess that was enough to get him to the final four glen does do a good job at portraying jorah though some interesting matchups i ended up with jon snow vs littlefinger sweet possible season conflict tyrion vs varys final best buds squared off and the dwarf got the best of the eunuch big upsets ones i think majority of the subreddit wouldnt agree with davos over dany sweet i love dragons and all that but liam cunningham is one of the more brilliant actors on the show jorah over jaime sweet jaimes character seemed to have real progression in season but he really reverted into his whole i fucklove my sister deal with it role in seasons hopefully hell change in also iain glen
asoiaf,removed,the show imo did an awful job of establishing jamie lannisters ability as a swordsman he is renowned and a prodigy in the books however i remember watching the show and picturing him someone on the softer side ned saying to him his armor has no scratches implying he talks a big game but doesnt see much combat at least that was my first opinion besides that you really only see him fight evenly with ned and get captured by robb
asoiaf,removed,deltree y cbarratheonline echo odoyle rules
asoiaf,removed,and i laughed about it there really is something for everyone in these books
asoiaf,removed,pretty pia that was done to her because she was about as slutty as slutty gets something about her sleeping with the guards of the castle so when the boltons claimed it they considered her a traitor and that was her punishment or whatever
asoiaf,removed,moving forward i got arya vs cersei do i choose arya who is a badass assassin or do i choose cersei who is one of the most powerfull women in westeros
asoiaf,removed,gotta respect the queen of wildfire currently while doing this im more torn apart between cersei and tyrion than i would like to admit
asoiaf,removed,oh you sweet sunmer child
asoiaf,removed,and sarah jessica parker as thunder dunks handsome steed runs hides
asoiaf,removed,sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,the people who he gives the declaration to still havent returned to the north so we dont know
asoiaf,removed,im not sure you even read my posts
asoiaf,removed,i made peace a long time ago with the fact that grm is going to die before his series is done the time to get upset will be when whoever gets creative control after he dies decides to stretch the series out another books before ending it to made more money
asoiaf,removed,no he is not legitimized because tommen baratheon is the one true king but maybe blackfish is leading the party down south to kings landing to slip jons legitimacy into the hundreds of other royal decrees that he blindly stamps really it depends on who you ask and whos sitting on the iron throne in end say hypothetically stannis wins the throne he wouldnt be too keen on honoring a false kings decree even though he made him the same offer the people of the north may accept it but unless theres a willing party in kings landing it will always be contested
asoiaf,removed,that somehow the show will ruin his experience he could fuck right off
asoiaf,removed,i dont believe in climate change to hell with the evidence
asoiaf,removed,not everyone wants to live a life of peace and drudgery and people enjoy different things you dont see the shades of gray because you think everyone has one set of morals and beliefs so are casting them as black or white personally there is not much i have a problem with that randyll tywin roose littlefinger walder cersei the ironborn or theon have done or would do much differently if i was in their shoes
asoiaf,removed,it also requires that you dont die before its ready and he isnt immortal
asoiaf,removed,what dude justwhat
asoiaf,removed,sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,the app is a world of ice and fire awoiaf while the history book is the world of ice and fire twoiaf robbs entry in awoiaf does state along the way he concludes that he must make sure winterfell has an heir should anything happen to him and over catelyns objections legitimizes jon snow and names him his heir
asoiaf,removed,i will just paste an answer that i gave in another alternative jons parentage theory im sorry if i will sound arrogant but can we just accept that jon is the princes son the show confirmed the clues go in this direction the foreshadow is in all five books and we still insist in alternative theories just because rlj is too obvious because its not im tired of saying that but thats not too obvious i only get the knowledge after a friend told me about a lot of readers only knew when they read the theory on asoiaf forums thats obvious now because oh gosh it has been twenty years since agot was released and the theory is the most popular of this universe why would the kingsguard be there if lyannas son is arthurs arthur is not king they stated it pretty clear that they were still honouring their vows to the targaryen family still almost everyday i come to this sub and see this kind of thing just because people cant accept that george also writes fantasy tropes thats ok not everything has to be subverted the story has dragons fucking dragons and elves and giants and people made of ice and people dreaming about the future and the past seriously people just accept it george revealing a different thing in the books would be such an awful thing after all the clues we got since arthur dayne is not jons father ashara dayne is not jons mother brandon stark is not jons father rhaegar and lyanna are jons parents lets move on
asoiaf,removed,youre delusional even if we see both books theyre gonig to be terrible he hasnt produced a book worth reading in over a decade you people run on pure fumes and delusion when it comes to the tv show the show runners are working wtihin martins story martins story is going to end up with john resurrected clearly
asoiaf,removed,downvoted this post but i had a reason do you realize how many of these posts have been made even recently do a search please and find the huge huge huge list of this post being repeatedly brought forth its so aggravating why do people up vote this post every time it comes up
asoiaf,removed,what passage you nutcase
asoiaf,removed,ned is imagining a hypothetical which is what i am doing as well his hypothetical uses completely different criteria than mine it would have been better for everyone if he had lied to cat about who jons father was rather than about who jons mother was that is all bye bitch
asoiaf,removed,i repeat that is all bye bitch
asoiaf,removed,dude the chances of a heart attack or stroke increase every year same with cancer or renal disease those may be rare occurrences but they can hit anyone at anytime in their lives and given that hes almost thats very possible regardless if hes ever diagnosed with any of those or he just shuts down in his sleep what happens im not knocking his health or anything im really not but he seems to not care about his magnum opus and he isnt getting any younger my question was is what happens when the worst inevitably does and his work is unfinished
asoiaf,removed,if this story is what everyone thinks it is then he wrote it years ago feel free to carry on being a jackass though
asoiaf,removed,lol at unbloodied westerlands stop trying to make them look powerful im not sure you understand the term unbloodied uevloret is referring to the fact that the westerlands were the only kingdom to not have been touched by the war and faced zero bloodshed the north riverlands the vale and the stormlands were distinctly at war with the crownlands the reach and dorne both sides faced losses but the westerlands with one of the largest wealthiest and strongest armies had not partaken so yeah they were at the paragon of their power while every other kingdom was reeling from the rebellion you would be really really foolish to think that the only army to remain untouched by the bloodshed so yes the strongest would lose easily if you killed tywin lannister despite the fact that youre delivering justice youd only be plunging the kingdom into another war because there would be a huge fucking uproar in the westerlands when you put their lord who saved your rebellious ass to death im not even talking about how youd kill jaime for killing the king you were going to kill anyway and the man who since you seem so hellbent on justice anyway regularly raped his wife burned courtiers high lords and was absofuckinglutely retarded and intent on burning the city down to ashes and expected them all to stand by youd be a holierthanthou morally ambitious baelor the blessedesque and really fucking dumb ruler
asoiaf,removed,i know reddit is a hotbed of lannister apologists and stark haters
asoiaf,removed,you can try to repackage it hilarious especially when you were just repacking lyannas story a sentence above with weak excuses nice double standards bro
asoiaf,removed,george pls
asoiaf,removed,t cuck
asoiaf,removed,no spoiler so brave
asoiaf,removed,it is possible if they had an outpost at the coast north of bear island the dragon could rest and eat there at night and explore at day dont know how much ground hed be able to cover before needing to rest it would be a cool reason for the others so have an ice dragon
asoiaf,removed,you do realize this wasnt a question right its an explanation of different horse breeds and terms
asoiaf,removed,i think the furthest north weve seen would be in the tv shows when the white walkers took crasters son far north to what looked like an entirely ice world
asoiaf,removed,i still think that pj understands the basic message of asoiaf better than most of the fandom most of the fandom which one the one in youtube comments the casuals my aunt watching with one eye open the one on rgot the rasoiaf hype trains that are here for fun or the heavyweights of rasoiaf or for example sites such as tower of the hand keep in mind that the people who are very active in the fandom arent the same as the people who are following for the cool explosions alone hes right that they condemn feudalism and aristocracy funnily enough i feel that if grrm wrote in the century western setting hed condemn modern oligarchy just the same and anyways it takes very few brain cells to notice that grrm has issues with great power being given to raging assholes exhibit a joffrey th egreater meta theme isnt feudalismaristocracy in particular but what is power asked varys and how it works hes right that grrm is skeptical of organized religions charlatans and prophecy many people seem to miss that point when they argue over which character is azor ahai and which character is going to win the iron throne seven hells ned even the most casual kelly c casuals got the memo once hardhome finished ive seen it happen and yes its easy to forget the icefire plots when of the narrative focuses on politics finally of course it matters wholl sit the iron throne or whatever political system may replace it at the end if the story goes that way precisely because this isnt your usual fantasy where some intrepid hero destroys the ring of power mormont was wrong itll take way more than a few ragged nights watch brothers to deal with winter alone nevermind the greater social issues happening in asoiaf grrm outright tells you to be skeptical of prophecy but many fans are convinced that there is one and only one azor ahai except ive seen around a million variations on how it either doesnt matter or it only matters in what peoplefollowers believe to give them focus one army with one purpose and power resides where men believe it resides also many ideas on how azorlightbringer are metaphorical they are nw or dragons or dragonglass or knowledge or specific magic or simply belief grrm shows you how war makes men kill each other for no good reason at least for a reason that doesnt benefit them directly lets see what the man himself says about war i didnt expect to get it because i wasnt a pacifist i felt then and i feel now that sometimes war is necessary war brings out the best and the worst in people literature of the past used to celebrate the glory of war then the hippie generation in the wrote about the ugliness of it i think theres truth in both related he said he wouldnt have fought in vietnam but he would have against nazis but some fans are convinced that the book ends with humanity defeating the evil others what does evil have to do with it are lannisters and starks evil i do think however that others being incompatible with of the biosphere and antagonistic towards anything with a pulse every time we see them might be a hint them being more complex than evil for lulz doesnt mean it wont be a war or that negotiationceasefire is even something they want and finally even if theyre icy vegan hippies it doesnt follow that realistically the humanity will be tolerant dany ruling the seven kingdoms after she marries jon snow assuming that both of them survive in mostly one piece its a good political alliance you know like most of the marriages we see in asoiaf and at least half of them are unhappy also most of the fandom i see barfs at the idea as too disney anyways so i dont see how preston is radical here grrm shows you that dragons are terrible and destructive weapons used to subdue the populace and maintain an unjust power structure a thinly veiled reference to nuclear warfare but some fans gush about whether or not tyrion is a dragon rider as opposed to the good rule of good king joffrey or the peaceful westeros of current canon that certainly didnt need dragons to make war incidentally the best golden age westeros ever had was under the rule of king jaehaerys i who happened to be a benevolent tyrant that had a crapton of dragons to help him along in negotiating with the tywin lannisters of his time i think its ironic that a lot of people who criticize preston jacobs for making factual errors have in fact failed to grasp the major themes of asoiaf themselves or themes are just like your opinion man ps one of the most popular posts of all time an alternate view on others by ucforresterthorne also one of the most popular blogs that deals a lot with the interesting othering theme httpsweirwoodleviathanwordpresscom by uyezenirl rant
asoiaf,removed,im triggered
asoiaf,removed,uasongofliceandfire is a bigot
asoiaf,removed,george rr martin is a year old white american male id be stunned if he wasnt a racist pos thats what the usa was built on and george came of age in the a radical time for civil rights i wouldnt expect him to have nuanced takes on any nonwhite culture and thats cool it doesnt diminish this series for me at all i still love and enjoy the work
asoiaf,removed,it wasnt meant to be a racial slur or discriminatory and it was in rerefence to how cultures that polygamy breed a lot faster than ones
asoiaf,removed,i think theyre really a merged character on the show sassy northern lady the show might have given lyanna a bit more of that feral mormont edge but they clearly were inspired by wylla
asoiaf,removed,completely agree loved all of lyannas scenes but she was speaking as the head of her house and with complete authority wylla was openly defying her lord grandfather and as you say believes house manderly should be completely loyal to the starks it was awesome to see lyannas sass but she didnt pledge her loyalty immediately
asoiaf,removed,in the books ramsay is just as psychotic if not more so i would argue more so i really dislike what they did with sansa in season especially but i think it can make sense from a streamlining perspective depending on how her storyline is resolved by the end of the series i am not confident that it her character will be handled correctly though if some of the leaks are true though
asoiaf,removed,the assassination was a hare brained simple thing that is more in robert than any dastardly gunning by cersei oh look a drunk who loves to hunt got drunk while hunting men are willfully blind it took ned forever to see it as well and he hated cersei you underestimate the lengths people go to fool themselves and overestimate everything about cersei shes absolutely an idiot
asoiaf,removed,go back to pornhub
asoiaf,removed,this makes me wonderstarfall was named after the star that actually fell therewhich they used to make dawn right could it be that winterfell was named like sobecause theres where the children created the first otheri know thats only a show thingbut who knows
asoiaf,removed,theon reek confirmed
asoiaf,removed,when qyburn said he had found something that might help after the trial by combat plan was screwed i thought it was a good guess it would be something crazy the tyrells plans and high sparrows monologues not having any effect isnt a cheap fuck up or anything its realistic it shows that everyone can be planning and still screw up robb ned oberyn stannis all had huge plans and monologues and yet they were all killed during their plans your asking of what effect did marges plans have is like asking what effect did robbs plans have
asoiaf,removed,this guy is a stalker and whiny
asoiaf,removed,while i wasnt thrilled by eurons portrayal in season the exception of his scene on the bridge that was very euron i do think his public persona ironborn donald trump will wind up being much different when hes speaking to important characters without legions of onlookers im hoping that hell reveal himself to be much more cunning than he lets on during his scenes with the kings landing crew also showing him to be a magic user would help things
asoiaf,removed,no comments faiiiiiiiiiiil
asoiaf,removed,agreed she could just make him the westerosi version of melania trump just stand there and look pretty sweetheart if you need to talk dont worry i will have missandei spell everything out for you phonetically fonetikalee now kiss mother of dragons thats a good little murdering slimeball does anybody have a problem with my husband or the dragons i have that will cook you if you do no i thought not
asoiaf,removed,shut up
asoiaf,removed,are you fucking kidding me no damphair is not anywhere close to being a tomaytotomahto type scenario
asoiaf,removed,were going to build a wall and the white walkers are going to pay for it
asoiaf,removed,this comment was removed for violating our httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikicivilitypolicy if you edit or remove the last sentence we can reapprove
asoiaf,removed,that im sorry sure felt condescending to me please dont violate rule
asoiaf,removed,worst case grrm kicks it tomorrow the next books dont come out and mylod is left to his own devices for the last two short seasons
asoiaf,removed,and emilia clarke is a better alternative a chubby midget woman with awful tits whatever floats your boat i guess
asoiaf,removed,i reckon trump winning probably set him back at least weeks while he cries in his beard and watches old daily show reruns
asoiaf,removed,itt mods will white knight him if we call grrm bad names or reference his rotundness as a sign of gluttony and sloth brb gotta read page description of one meal we musnt forget the lampreys
asoiaf,removed,the other series i read of books that take forever to come out is robert caros the years of lyndon johnson caro has an office and goes in every day wearing a tie specifically so he views it as a job not something he can get around to whenever he also tries to hit a certain page target every day too
asoiaf,removed,why the wow will never be published fuck you man some of us are hanging to hope by the skin of their teeth we dont need pessimism for each other
asoiaf,removed,but just because shes evil doesnt mean that he gets to abuse her or taking her word for it rape her doesnt she deserve it since shes evil
asoiaf,removed,is there any chance someone more skilled than me at photoshop could get rid of the text those would make some great backgrounds
asoiaf,removed,anyone know what the picture is of im thinking dany escaping the house of the undying but it looks a little more lovecraftian than i would think pretty bad ass for sure
asoiaf,removed,at the same time from what flashbacks we see of her past she was also an absolute bitch even at a young age from torturing tyrian when he was an infant to threshing death on those who angered her she was a monster from start to finish
asoiaf,removed,myachs body is on the hounds horse also that is an incredibly stupid example because we know why tyrion lied to jaime and tyrion owns thoughts show he is innocent in his povs also we know the real killers seriously stop being so dense
asoiaf,removed,she figured out how to do that after awhile but at first no cersei was subjected to what is called marital rape you know i married you and i want sex so get ready its coming
asoiaf,removed,are there rules against voting for nonreddit related asoiaf things like best podcast best youtuber best blogger best tumblr
asoiaf,removed,im just at the part in feast for crows where shes thinking about how robert use to rape her she would normally try to distract him with oral it whatever but when he was drunk he wouldnt take no for an answer and would hurt her she mentions how when they were first married it would happen once a month or so and after a few years it slowed down to one a year
asoiaf,removed,she swallows though thats a plus and a wtf moment in the book
asoiaf,removed,could someone make this a phone background
asoiaf,removed,silent sisters are not there when someone is killed and they are not trained murders so that comparison makes no sense like the tyrion one made earlier your love for the hound has made you desperate to defend him you would probably defend him even if he murdered your own family and who was this mycah boy im not a boy but mycah was he was a butchers boy and you killed him jory said you cut him near in half and he never even had a sword she could feel them looking at her now the women and the children and the men who called themselves the knights of the hollow hill whos this now someone asked the hound answered seven hells the little sister the brat who tossed joff s pretty sword in the river he gave a bark of laughter dont you know youre dead no youre dead she threw back at him harwin took her arm to draw her back as lord beric said the girl has named you a murderer do you deny killing this butchers boy mycah the big man shrugged i was joffreys sworn shield the butchers boy attacked a prince of the blood
asoiaf,removed,tinfoil arya is the real song of ice and fire which are two sides of the many faced god jon is actually neds bastard by wylla and arya is the rl massive red herring s
asoiaf,removed,i always find it funny how fans will praise rhaegar as being noble when he runs offmaybe kidnaps a teenage girl he then fathers a bastard with while his wife and kids are at home and his wife just had the second kid robert fathering a couple bastards while single and a young man himself a mark of bad character lyanna didnt like that he slept around so lyanna would then run off with a guy whod be cheating on his wife
asoiaf,removed,there are always rules designed to keep people civil literally all the time do you call people names all the time you literally had to delete like messages because you were rude in so many of them and that was before you just started childishly writing prove it to everything i said id stop talking to your very unfriendly self altogether but i like writing about this stuff
asoiaf,removed,seeing how he deals with the burden on his shoulders as the leader of a rebellion and the first kitn for centuries all as just a year old the transitional phase as he takes over at winterfell and news of whats happening down south begins to reach him bit by bit would be interesting to read from his perspective
asoiaf,removed,cersei should remain sweet seductive and attractive at least untill joffreys death was portrayed as bitter cold and far past her good days with simply repulsive demeanor of an old hag lena was still somehow attractive but her features and acting were so unpleasant that it ruined cerseis frame of femme fatale joffrey should be a younger version of jaime aka prince charming was a simple douche with a douchy looks and douchy acting i think youve done a great job of articulating the issues with these specific portrayals in a thread where oddly they have been praised you especially nailed the description of cersei she is just repulsive in many ways in the show from the outset even though shes supposed to have superficial charm on the exterior and at the risk of sounding like a total asshole jack gleeson looks like he has an extra chromosome while joffrey is supposed to be jaime come again some people here have said all of the lannister portrayals were spot on but i actually think that family has the most wide divergence in terms of excellent and terrible portrayals of any in the show
asoiaf,removed,sweetsummerchild
asoiaf,removed,grow up youre just looking for something to post no matter how stupid
asoiaf,removed,no ones said it yet ok ill do it oh sweet summer child honestly i think hell tell us when its ready i think it wont be too much longer but i wont pin my hopes to significant calendar days there will be enough celebrating around here without it needing to be new years
asoiaf,removed,i would ask you when you finished the books versus if you saw the show first many of us starting at the first book if not the first if you showed yo from the show you already have a huge head start and cant be as entitled waiting for the next book others can remember that some people have been in this world for or so years try waiting that long and not being negative sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,whiny bitches just be thankful you enjoyed a part of this grand story there are other books to read other things to fill your time let the man work in peace every single reader should just say thank you to grrm because he doesnt owe you anything
asoiaf,removed,sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,someone correct me if im wrong but the leaked season plot outline had jon being called aegon in it so potentially a good call op
asoiaf,removed,and what about the other guy
asoiaf,removed,i thought that said nigger at first
asoiaf,removed,just google it for free and get the pdf bro
asoiaf,removed,he says how he knows in the scene for all the the talk about how stupid show watchers are on this subreddit there are a quite a few dumb questions that could be answered if you actually paid attention to the show posed by the alleged superfan i read some fantasy book people around here
asoiaf,removed,the power users abandoned this subreddit over time this was partly due to abusive behavior by some of the mods favoring some yt accounts over others some podcasts over others etc some of them have their own special interests and it got political it wasnt a coincidence that was removed as a mod when he starting complaining plus there was the whole banning people willynilly and starting grudge matches with long time users at the start of then they started banning any mention of rival subreddits which you cant even mention on this subreddit because they have automoderator set to remove mention of it im talking about r f r e e f o l k just by itself thats a subreddit of almost based solely on frustration over how moderation is handled here and in rgameofthrones i think a lot of the power users got tired of waiting for a new book and tired of having to argue with new fans when theyd already spent years theorizing i was a long time user usually critical of the mods and always advocated for making this subreddit very limited in terms of the show like one thread per show thats it now the subreddit is barely better than rgameofthrones which has already reached rbreakingbad level of awful
asoiaf,removed,u dumb whore
asoiaf,removed,beautiful book but the people who helped write it are utter wankers elio and linda are cancerous to this community and are the definition of book elitists
asoiaf,removed,i think you may have had a stroke and should seek medical attention
asoiaf,removed,sorry mom im only little
asoiaf,removed,try stepping off that high horse buddy
asoiaf,removed,there were blackfyres with black hair and black eyes idiot
asoiaf,removed,it is funny how those sjws jump on the rhaegar raped lyanna train but forget it would have been worse than that tin foil theory if she married robert on a youtube comment section i met one of those idiots and no matter howmuch evidence i used from both the books and the show they still refused to listen to reason then i brought that robert actually did rape cerseiin her povs she laments how other than the night of the wedding she never wanted robert inside her and would have raped lyanna that idiot was dumbfounded and never replied
asoiaf,removed,cape wrath is a very significant portion of the stormlands about a in the newest chapter of twow we have already been told that storms end has been captured the iron throne is in no position to resist these attacks considering mace tyrell is moving his army away from storms end in order to ensure margaerys release from the sparrows
asoiaf,removed,thats good news for trump
asoiaf,removed,hed be the hillary clinton of westeros shy of nothing to gain and keep power
asoiaf,removed,when will rasoiaf be great again
asoiaf,removed,cersei is like hillary clinton she is now too powerful to convict no matter who she kills lies to or says under oath lol can not help but to compare those two to each other
asoiaf,removed,wow that linkriamverysmart much
asoiaf,removed,good point i mean they remove any critcism of the mods and are even doing so in this thread i merely mentioned a rival subreddit and it was removed without warning it depends on what the mods see if they see that the r free folk sub is mentioned it gets deleted automatically
asoiaf,removed,i was inspired by the greatest tv show ever i wrote this song and made this video just in time for summer funi wish i had a dragon to fly on so high through the lush valleys and mountains of our planet i hope this video inspires you too please watch and share this goes out to the raven
asoiaf,removed,no this is an existing theory smart ass this whole tread is stupid its like someone just heard of rlj
asoiaf,removed,this was already discussed after the reveal stupid
asoiaf,removed,fuck off
asoiaf,removed,wildlings you know this is gonna cost a fortune right brandon the bigot the wall just got ten feet higher
asoiaf,removed,only if they measured in trumpsized hands
asoiaf,removed,im removing this because of the unnecessary shade youre throwing at grrm what you gotta know about grrm is that he rarely if ever nibbles dude freakin gobbles if you edit out all the instances of things like that it can be reapproved
asoiaf,removed,its a really good post i was so impressed actually that i was suggesting it to someone via messenger when they told me the post had been removed i still have it
asoiaf,removed,for people like you it seems
asoiaf,removed,note like many of you i consider any speculation on grrms health and lifespan to be in poorer taste than a kardashian family reunion this post is not about that it assumes grrm does what we all want him to do which is live a long giggleriddled life with many prosperous years ahead of him thats the happy part the sad part is that despite the cynicism and pessimism surrounding twows lack of release ive read around here lately many people are still assuming that the series can end in two books thats sweet summer child ish right there folks its unrealistic to expect two more books at this point according to grrm himself early on in the writing of twow he planned for twow and ados to both be gargantuan behemoths of pages each thats maximum book length right there if you wrote books any bigger youd have to literally bind them differently and give them a pair of grrmlabel suspenders just to keep them in tact publishers wont go beyond this because they cant properly bind ponderous tomes of such staggering size but lets back up a second what you gotta know about grrm is that he rarely if ever nibbles dude freakin gobbles grrm always always always writes more than he thinks hell write thats been the history of asoiaf since it began especially when he abandoned the fiveyear gap and decided to write it out and combine it with the story instead he did it with adwd couldnt fit in the two big battles to which hed been building up he did it with twoiaf writing hundreds of thousands of words that went unpublished he did it with affc ultimately turning the follow up to asos into two fulllength novels he did it with the first three novels fleshing out the war of five kings into three fantastic books we know precious little about the writing of twow true but grrms sisyphean struggle with deadlines tell us that its going about as smoothly as a yara greyjoy covert op grrm is a manticore whos going to sting us midstream why because it is his nature which is fine well eat it all up like its fried bread and ask for a second helping of lamprey pie except we forget the limit pushes the physical binding of books like too much sausage in too little casing any deviation from grrms earliest estimates and remember he always writes more not less will necessitate an eighth book in my estimation its already in the works he just hasnt announced it yet he may not even know it yet its worse than you think lets say grrm had finished adwd cleanly that it included all the stuff he wanted in like two arianne chapters arianne i and ii twow were originally intended for adwd but were moved to twow aeron damphair two huge battle sequences winterfell and meereen were moved to twow chili con queso now you have a cleanlywrapped adwd and george r r martin claiming that he needs two sausages stuffed to the casings capacity in order to wrap up the series that would still be an optimistic assumption dont forget these two final acts have been in the future tense since the beginning of the series and we already know that twow has to accomplish the goals of twow and the final act of adwd both at once think on the tv show for a moment the tv show spoilers tv show do any of us realistically expect grrm will be even close to this same point at the end of twow nevermind that grrm has planned the final two acts of the series for about twenty years now nevermind that most of the story has filled in before these acts have even appeared the simple fact is grrm is so far behind his own general structure for the story that even believing he could wrap the story up in two novels beggars belief the show has been able to do it because they have to do it theyve made major sacrifices along the way like cutting out entire plotlines quentyn and aegon vi come to mind grrm has showed himself as unwilling to cut these plotlines out in favor of the ultimate structure and pace of the larger story im fine with that he can write the books as he pleases but pretending there are only two more novels to goits just silly at this point the but pov characters will die in twow fallacy the popular counterargument is that grrm is going to thin the herd of pov characters and hes finally promising that he wont add more great fantastic naturally grrm will stick to this selfimposed limitation oh wait that never happens in the most recent book grrm added the following new povs jon connington victarion greyjoy quentyn martell melisandre barristan selmy thats in one book moreover we know that grrm added barristan selmy not because he planned it but because he needed a way to resolve the meereenese knot it was an invention of necessity since asos grrm shrank the scope of his books only once in two attempts and that was a halfbook that became affc grrm cut nothing from this book he simply didnt publish it all at once to expect grrm to suddenly cut characters trim down his plotlines and bring us back on the hype train at full steam ahead simply flies in the face of his progress since asos you keep thinking that manticore wont sting you heres my point unless you start slaughtering pov characters and wrapping up the story ahead of time twow wont shrink maybe victarion greyjoy dies early does that really bode well for the length of twow will grrm suddenly write smoothly and get the plot moving because victarion is dead grrm doesnt have to stick to this promise he promised adwd would be out a year after affc he promised a trilogy he wanted a five yeargap he wanted many things but when a story moves in ways you dont expect sometimes you have to go back on these promises grrm has lost the pressure of getting to his ending first there is now incentive for grrm to create a rich world separate from the tv show rather than moving the train ahead as quickly as he can grrm is now free to explore every creative impulse he has this does not bode well for the completion of the series i love grrm i love his writing but we have to face facts believing that this series is only two books away from a satisfying ending is just as naive as believing twow was ready in the history of the series and grrms interaction with it suggest or books will ultimately be required tldr like reading asoiaf good because its going to last a long time
asoiaf,removed,i think dany might be the final antagonist of the series jon will have to fight his own aunt as after shes gone kinda nuts
asoiaf,removed,would you let your year old join the army for life hell yeah i fucking hate my daughter id hope she gets hit by an isis ied would sure save me college tuition shes also kind of a slut so it would be good to keep her away from boys
asoiaf,removed,offended lol jackass someone tried to explain your religion to people but made a handful of honest mistakes and that offended you get a life
asoiaf,removed,like most women she has no character intelligence or loyalty i really want to believe that he means most women that grrm writes and not most women
asoiaf,removed,i dont think well see dany ruling again everything seems set for dany and possibly jon to die
asoiaf,removed,prediction grrm croaks before writing the whole saga
asoiaf,removed,this might be the dumbest post title ive ever seen have a downvote and my scorn id respond sincerely if it werent for that title
asoiaf,removed,youre acting like a petulant child get over it
asoiaf,removed,why is speculating about grrms lifespan in poor taste hes old and hes fat as shit people are naturally going to worry that he could get seriously ill or die before he is able to conclude the series especially if as you say he wont be able to do it in the next two books
asoiaf,removed,hasnt given up has he
asoiaf,removed,alright here we go tons of question will make the answers brief feel free to ask for clarification a i believe grrm mentioned somewhere in an interview that it was round perhaps slightly larger than our world b grrm also mentioned that the seasons will be explained could be just weird orbits or magic also could be something with the others and dragons ice and fire i dont believe anyone has sailed the full distance around much of the map is incomplete because of it c dont quote me but im pretty sure the criminals cant leave the wall back in the day it was full of mostly volunteer warriors such as jon so the speech may be an old one anyways the criminals technically have an option but if they chose not to take the vows they are executed sorta unfair but thats the law so they all take the vows d we dont know why jaqen hghar was in the kl prisons good chance he just killed someone faceless man style but was arrested so he pretended to be just a normal killer highly doubt anyone knows he is a fm d its been said by unaughtyrev but jorah fought as one of neds bannermen during the rebellion as lord of bear island or heir not sure on the timelines depends on when the old bear took his vows he fought on the trident with hundreds of thousands of people he also tells dany over in acok that he also fought during the greyjoy rebellion right afterwards he says he stormed the castle right behind thoros of myr and his flaming sword the first to charge dany likely forgives him due to the loyalty he has already showed her sadly the whole spying thing gets leaked and is the straw that breaks the camels back as he is banished d im not sure although i dont think it has been revealed why he takes the black lots of northerners do or at least its not unheard of perhaps he thought it jorahs time to rule e the doom of valyria heres a link discussing the lore behind valyria really good read pretty much a summary is they became the biggest power house in the known world and then they all died except the targ family who hid on dragonstone the targs got visions of the doom so they ran many different theorys exist such as the fm causing the doom or volcanoes most likely it was a massive volcano eruption due to their greed they constantly had slaves mine under volcanoes for more wealth and power eventually the greed got to them and they all died although its not confirmed f im actually not sure my guess would be robert chose some like selmy but littlefinger varys and all the other schemes or idiots on the counsel managed to convince him to add a bunch of cravens that or all the good warriors were killed in the rebellion and there were slim pickings not sure tbh g once again i believe unaughtyrev has it right yes the westerlings planned the betrayal but jeyne wasnt in on it they wanted to get their house back in to the good graces of the lannisters and regain lost wealth and lands i many theories about his whereabouts most popular is that he was arrested and was freed by arya after he changed his face cough jaqen hghar cough but imo he is most likely dead we dont see his death cause arya doesnt j again lots of mystery behind ashara and ned or ashara in general baby between them was almost certainly rumor many like cersie and cat believe jon is that baby but one of the biggest hint for rlj is that ned just wouldnt do that with another women even one he loved like ashara and yeah i think there was a thing going on between them but the ned was married to cat instead of brandon ned traveled to starfall asharas place after toj fightrebellion which only fuels the rumors as he returns with jon but likely jon was lyannas and rhaegars and the went to starfall to give back ser arthur daynes sword dawn k the others are inhuman icelike creatures the wights that serve them are the reanimated dead mindless zombies the others appear to have a language and everything unaughtyrev credit where credits due l as many have said probably the horn jon found and sam currently has it keeps popping up in text often right after chapters than mention joramuns horn of winter sam will likely find a way to mend the cracks and use it m i think drogon is danys the aggression is to show the reader how difficult it is to control the dragons they are like nukes doesnt matter whos side they are on they are violent and destructive and dangerous to wield plus i think its even harder cause they are the first dragons in a long time sorta like training a wolf instead of a dog before it was easier cause it was almost in the dragons nature to obey seeing other dragons do the same just my take on it n i think tywins respect comes from his raw intelligence sorta like how people like tyrion despite the whoring the problem with tywin is how hypocritical he is in the end he is just a better looking tyrion that cant except who he is ñ alchemist has not been named but its likely jaqen hghar again he wanted a book of dragons or something from pate but its likely not jaqen wearing pates face to get the book or to hide loose ends urolypolyboley
asoiaf,removed,well ive subscribed to this sub long ago so thats part of it and i will definitely borrowpirate the books once theyre out its just that i wont give him or his publishers my money anymore
asoiaf,removed,good for him but it doesnt answer my question or my point
asoiaf,removed,actually its been heavily implied by the actors themselves that at least the three stark childrensansa arya and bran reunite this season
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,not including belwas was a critical mistake
asoiaf,removed,thats funny because i feel almost the opposite that and have been among the strongest seasons with the strength being their divergence from the books or progression from where the books left off of course there have been a few aspects that didnt work cough sand snakes but im happy to know that ill get at least a version of the finished story in my life time and a decent one at that even if it lacks the depth and breadth of the books
asoiaf,removed,he might i mean he finally said the next book will release this summer so thats a start
asoiaf,removed,i am motherly and good inside and yet judging by this comment still an idiot she doesnt have to love or care for him cause its not her child that doesnt make her bad anymore than it makes you good get off your high horse
asoiaf,removed,i really dont thing that faithfulness to affc and adwd would be better for the show can you imagine briennes storyline would be just wast of time tyrions storyline without dany wouldnt have any climax just like in the books they cut so many filler from jons cerseis and danys storylines and created much better paced plot they also made jons storyline much better with hardhome sansa in the vale would make for an interesting season more dorne more iron islands
asoiaf,removed,for seasons one and two id agree but then in season we have the issue of robbs wife and one of the great thematic connections in the books how both ned and robb do the honorable thing with similar consequences is ditched for a romance subplot
asoiaf,removed,there are more reasons to like the show other than how closely it matches the books which i adore but might not have gotten into without the show the show is worth watching for the costuming alone in my opinion also im still waiting to find out about the honeycomb and the jackass in the brothel
asoiaf,removed,spoilers alli must admit i feel bewildered by the way the show keeps certain plot elements but transfers them to different characters and kills off certain other characters shireen really
asoiaf,removed,just rely on your best instincts teaminstinct ftw
asoiaf,removed,elio and linda suck id never buy it they are lame hacks cersei should get theoned she should have her vagina sewn shut elio and linda cant ban me here for saying that
asoiaf,removed,you really did it this time man youre getting downvoted hard
asoiaf,removed,sounds like something a literate donald trump would say
asoiaf,removed,tbh i dont think that most women like other women i dont think i could be a lesbian i think i might turn into a wife beater
asoiaf,removed,dude im so fucking pissed ive avoided everything and this fucking idiot with his fucking stupid post
asoiaf,removed,oh well dag i guess i shouldnt have pmd op and reported the post then
asoiaf,removed,asoiaf fanatics are hypocrites and masochists
asoiaf,removed,yeah i get it although in all honesty i dont see whats so bad about that quote a guy comes and says that he has a hard time understanding womans signs i say that he shouldnt feel bad about it because they cant even understand them themselves i mean i was just practically just saying that women were complicated and their signs were hard to understand i mean every day i see or write quotes from the sand snakes you know which one and those get tons of upvotes and jokes as answers
asoiaf,removed,its not an outlandish claim to make in the similar obscure interview he said that the second part of a trilogy will be dany landing in westeros and the final part war aginst the others that would be needed to be sourced but that interview answer is by now well referenced
asoiaf,removed,reminder the user who posted this thread has made it a no spoilers thread spoilers for any of the books or any season of the tv showeven the first book or the first seasonrequire a spoiler tag to create a spoiler tag use this code s things happen to get this s things happen

asoiaf,removed,youre a fool
asoiaf,removed,riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,asos is the better of the two but both are much better than clash and feast and dance are their own entity i dont know im depressed today so who gives a shit if winds ever gets released trump and hilary are going to destroy america and we are headed toward world war or a new cold war im watching too much cnn or alex jones or fox im leaving forever bye maybe grrm feels the same maybe thats why hes doing what hes doing hes probably preparing for nuclear war so hes been building his safe spot with food and music and food
asoiaf,removed,wtf so sad
asoiaf,removed,ser loras surviving that blast is probably the dumbest thing ive read on this subreddit in the last hours
asoiaf,removed,thank you for posting this hopefully now rl haters and people swearing aerys raped lyanna can stfu
asoiaf,removed,retard
asoiaf,removed,not true she is arrested bc of sex without marriage not bc she was raped if her rape is prooved shell get released btw her rapist is arrested to again not charged yet sex without marriage is haram rape is also haram in islam so they are forbidden in sharia law if rape is prooved then woman will get released and rapist get his cock ripped out from him in islam raping is a huge sin not for the raped but for rapist
asoiaf,removed,it is no secret there has been a severe feminist push in the movie business in the western world just look at the recent jennifer lawrence outbursts about pay and lead roles or jada pinkett smith and her oscars statements lol wow one person complaining about inequality and another complaining about racism that was completely shit on by everyone else is your evidence of the feminist conspiracy okie dokie then the complete overhaul in the show serves only to push forward independent women in control of a major region of westeros its not feminist to have independent women in control of something itd be fucking weird if that was completely absent is that what you want or something
asoiaf,removed,lol ok
asoiaf,removed,why the mods dont allow this video yesterday i tried to post it but i didnt allow me
asoiaf,removed,i cant watch these videos his characters he pretends to be are absolutely cringeworthy he sounds like a pedo
asoiaf,removed,yet both jon and raegar are described in detail are you even thinking about what youre writing if i describe a famous persons appearance in detail what chance do you think you have of recognizing them from a mere verbal description seriously now this is just silly list everything described about their appearances and the appearances have no similarities at all tell me how you know they dont have the same nose or the same check bone structure which part of their descriptions rule that out besides youre the one that said that the daynea have the same features as the targaryans which isnt completely true what i said isnt inaccurate if you assume that it pertains to the context rather than being a random statement were specifically discussing heritable traits and the traits you were talking about appear in members of that family line your quibbles on this count are irrelevant to the actual point regarding heritable traits the gene for these traits are present in both rheagar and arthurs lines that jon doesnt have this eye color trait for instance doesnt indicate that rheagar isnt his father and it certainly doesnt indicate that someone else who might have this trait for all we know is more likely to be his father particularly when this other persons own sister has this unusual trait the difference is that while we have a detailed description of raegar we have no such description of arthur dayne describe rheagars nose are his ear lobs attached or unattached what distinguishes his check bones from jons so overall its possible that jon has some of arthurs features but as of yet weve seen that jon shares no notable features with reagar thats not actually entirely accurate in fact its more accurate to say overall its possible that jon has some of rheagars features but as of yet weve not seen that jon shares notable features with arthur im not claiming that dayne is any more likely than raegar to be jons father youre just posting in a thread that sets this theory forth to say you like it and how it better explains things than rljnot that youre claiming its anymore likely or anything just that you like it more because its a better explanation yeah sure if you say so the kingsguard at the toj had access to information about both the trident and the sack of kings landing and raegar was capable of knowing to march north there was clearly some kind of line of communication that assumption is speculative aerys sent someone to physically fetch rheagar that as much suggests there was no lines of communication as that there was i can only assume that if she were there freely by her own will she would be given this information and would likely know as much as those she was with no you have a choice there is no compulsion to make that baseless assumption and it is baseless however if she were there against her will it wouldnt matter whether she had the information or not because she couldnt leave why allow her to access this information if it would make her leave and rheagar doesnt want her to leave or want to hold her as a prisoner whats the basis for that assumption because there was plenty of time for her to hear about the imprisonment of her father and the request for her brother what request she may not have known that war was coming or the execution your argument was thus but whos to say she loved him enough to run away with him and knowingly start a war resulting in the deaths of her father and brother that she knowingly started a war is the entire crux of this dispute your argument is that she did but now youre arguing thats not your argument sure whatever if you say so the same way the kingsguard at the toj knew the details of both the battle at the trident and the sack of kinga landing so youre back to baselessy assuming that lyanna was kept informed of all information rather than merely what rheagar thought it was prudent for her to know sounds very much like unwilling imprisonment to me sounds very much like baseless assumption to me ned kept secrets from cat did their marriage sound like unwilling imprisonment to you theres a vast difference between imprisoning someone and keeping information from someone who is with you willingly but might not keep doing so if they have that information is not telling your spouse about an affair the same as imprisonment im arguing that she wasnt in love with raegar and didnt go with him willingly as a reason for why you prefer arthur is the daddy to rheagar is the daddy whereas whether she went willingly or not doesnt have any bearing on who got her pregnant she could have gone willingly to have an affair with dayne or with rheagar or unwillingly have been kidnapped and then raped by rheagar or by dayne whether she went willingly doesnt tell us anything about who the daddy of her baby is once the war started she may not have been able to stop it but before it did before it did she had no way of knowing it was going to happen so how could she know to even try to stop it at that point the execution of her brother and father is the first indication that things have exploded off the rails and cant be resolved diplomatically and its also when aerys demands neds and roberts heads before that rickard was confident enough of a diplomatic resolution that he rode passively into kl at aerys summons if lyannas father didnt realize the severity of the situation why should lyanna have done so had the relationship been of mutual adoration lyanna would have at least the powerto attempt to convince the targaryans or at least reagar to release her father ijustno the only targaryan she is in contact with that we know of is rheagar and aerys and rheagar dont even get along rheagar couldnt stop aerys holding his own wife and two children hostage there are even indications rheagar might have been planning a coup or to otherwise depose aerys nothing suggests that aerys was liable to heed either lyanna or rheagars pleading in the matter if anything aerys was paranoid of rheagar and hence just as likely to do the opposite of whatever he asked as to comply and in any case your argument was she could have intervened by making it known she went with rheagar willingly now its special pleadings to aerys you keep changing what youre arguing the three possibilities for why that didnt happen that i can think of are heres a the first she was aware that war was likely to break out or that her family members were likely to be killed over this whole debacle was after war had broken out and her two family members had already been killed lyannas age is irrelevant no one said it was and you are still not getting it in westeros its technically no different from the abduction of a year old if the year old is the maiden daughter of an important person like a great lord in which case its like kidnapping a year old in our society do you know what analogy is do you understand that i am not saying lyanna was a year old rhaegar met on the internet i am saying that taking a great lords willing maiden daughter in westeros is perceived by westerosi very similarly to how we would perceive an adult taking a willing year they met on the internet its not up to the old and its not up to the maiden daughter its abduction no matter what the old in our society or the maiden daughter in their society wants real abduction not merely technically but really seriously and actually about the events that are transpiring because of her round and round and round the point we go again you said knowingly regarding lyanna and the war because she didntwell its not clear tell her father something irrelevant i went willingly or make special pleadings to someone she means nothing to through the son he is paranoid of and who might be trying to depose him but this ignores the point that if it was obvious that the war would happen before it was too late then rickard was an idiot for going to kl and if it wasnt obvious until it was too late for rickard to choose otherwise then it wasnt obvious in time for lyanna to do anything about it why should lyanna have realized where this was heading when her more experienced father still thought he could resolve it diplomatically thats what im saying youre saying she knowingly let a war happen because she didnt do something when her much more experienced father didnt see that a war was about to break out rickard went to kl when summoned if he thought he couldnt convince aerys to free his son thats pointless if he thought aerys would execute him his son and call for his other sons head its pointlessly suicidal with a side dressing of infanticide by proxy but if rickard was behaving reasonably in the circumstances then war wasnt reasonably predictable to lyanna either at that point and after that point its too late and as pointed out its far fetched to suggest that she would have the power to stop it if she knew in fact once brandon was arrested it was too early to predict the outcome would be war yet probably already too late for lyanna or anyone at the toj to stop it
asoiaf,removed,grrm is best friends with this guy
asoiaf,removed,dude there is nothing that implies that its roberts baby if she was kidnapped and was pregnant with roberts baby at the time and then died in childbirth as she was rescued by ned then she would not have told him to conceal the baby from robert at risk of death thats completely retarded lol and all the reasons youre giving for why its hard to know who jons dad is are the reasons why they were smart to not name rhaegar as his father just yet its the most widely known fan theory there is and the show runners are aware of that its obvious to the majority of fans that its rhaegar and it leaves just enough mystery to make it easier to give us a proper introduction to rhaegar next season via flashbacks
asoiaf,removed,maybe read and understand the post before replying to it
asoiaf,removed,im not wrong youre needlessly obstinate and obviously dont understand how this universe works
asoiaf,removed,thank you people be retarded up in here
asoiaf,removed,httpimgurcomcvfpfue also looks like this guy deleting his most recent rage filled comment calm down man
asoiaf,removed,there is more rage evident in your reply than in my post which was simply a lot of facts all laid out in a row
asoiaf,removed,true you just speak gibberish in general
asoiaf,removed,how do you get she came out of that passage drop your rude ass tone too or dont reply further
asoiaf,removed,show onlies can suck a lemon
asoiaf,removed,jesus some people never get satisfied
asoiaf,removed,coopting lindas opinion is not a good look
asoiaf,removed,stop with the jetpackteleporter stuff everyone its been explained and just use a little bit of your brain once in a while
asoiaf,removed,welcome to woman ill be your guide
asoiaf,removed,shes retarded and impulsive theres no end this will end well
asoiaf,removed,probably downvote me
asoiaf,removed,yes my bro i dont mean that all women are crazy like cersei but saying that they dont put emotion in front of logic a lot of times is just not realistic i dont want a gift but dont dare you dont give me one
asoiaf,removed,you say that
asoiaf,removed,i dont wanna be that guy but if you dont get rlj from the tower of joy scene and you browse this sub then youre an idiot it really should only confuse show only people who dont sub rasoiaf its obvious more obvious than jons resurrection
asoiaf,removed,woman rational pick one
asoiaf,removed,everyone in this thread has brain problems dd write the script if they include a retarded terminator chase sequence you cant really not include said retarded terminator chase sequence this isnt the directors fault jesus christ
asoiaf,removed,it may not be in the official rules and im no mod but i dont think we should be downvoting a comment to points just because that we disagree with that persons ideas lets use our words people if you disagree with someone comment and say why just my two cents but someone will probably disagree with this comment and downvote it
asoiaf,removed,there we go cant make simple jokes without it being sexism the level of pc and sjw weve reached as a society now is mind boggling
asoiaf,removed,my bad man not meaning to name call anyone in particular
asoiaf,removed,tldr waaaaaghhh
asoiaf,removed,im comforted by the fact that the show is quite different therefore i dont know which events are spoilers except the obvious ones and which are just made up by the show writers i think hodors name and rlj is confirmed but everything else could be drastically different did cersei skip the trial and blow them up did stannis lose to ramsay did arya kill the waif and leave braavos like that did she return and kill walder all of these could be just show events or they could actually happen in the books i wouldnt lose hope for the books at all
asoiaf,removed,idiot
asoiaf,removed,lmao my nigga i was just gonna post this when i saw this thread of course you at the top
asoiaf,removed,no shit sherlock
asoiaf,removed,dont ever fucking speak to me that way again this entire reddit is so full of shit

asoiaf,removed,make the seven kingdoms great again
asoiaf,removed,most of them being unwarranted is just straight up wrong most of them bring up valid issues with some snark added in suprise welcome to the internet meanwhile in your last sentence you imply that only the people who agree with you actually understand your post so anyone who disagrees or has issues with it just doesnt get it heaven forbid your theory might have a hole or two no surely everyone who disagrees is just an idiot
asoiaf,removed,just fucking use leaked tag why the fuck is this even a discussion thing why you gotta make it so complicated and convoluted the only thing youre gonna cause is people leaving the sub and i sure as fuck dont want to do that
asoiaf,removed,how do you figure its being lazy on my part i want to be able to talk about whatever within the post i created if you dont like it then dont click on the post i made and make your ownyour being lazy go make your own post and start some discussion stop trying to tell other people that they are lazy because you dont like what they are talking about why cant the people who dont like spoilers everyhing posts create their own content wouldnt that solve all the rpoblems according to the mods and their surveys there are tons of people who want to avoid the everything threadsso why dont those peopel make their own threads there shouldnt be a shortage of threads since according to the mods they make up the largest percentage of users on this sub so stop being lazy and make your own threads with a scope you want
asoiaf,removed,i once banged this little nympho out of rhode island girls nips were responsive as fuuucckk

asoiaf,removed,im sorry but she seems dumb as shit did she ride the short bus to school dropped on her head as an infant
asoiaf,removed,only to him i was being civil he was not and hasnt been all over this thread to multiple people
asoiaf,removed,i agree but its clear now with season and the news about season davos must become loyal to jon and his right hand man in the books they rushed the hell out of it on the show though i have no idea how this will transpire in the books but its too big a change having davos go everywhere with jon snow if grrm didnt tell them something about the future jondavos relationship
asoiaf,removed,wtf kind of shit writing has this story go to that direction
asoiaf,removed,that would be predictable given that she commands an army of over a fleet over ships and three dragons already has the alliance of two regions which one of them is the biggest food supplier of the entire realm as well as some more resources in essos you may claim predictable equal bad but something that is already established and logically should happen given the info will never be considered bad i want you to explain in which fcking universe does dany let jaime command an army of hers and in which fcking universe does whatever this upjumped lannister says convinces his danygiven troops you want to get jon roasted by his aunt this is the way to go
asoiaf,removed,you say it like youre the first man to think it yes the wall is a chrkhovs gun what other brilliant insights have you brought us today
asoiaf,removed,this reads as predictable fanservice fanservice because of forced reuniouns and justiceporn same dagger and predictable in a true dd style that maybe tells us that george didnt tell them anything because he himself maybe hadt invent anything yet or because it reads as predictable fanservice it could be just fake leaks by attention whoring fans
asoiaf,removed,me too because its gonna get downvoted really fast by all the people who cant take anybody offending dnd and got
asoiaf,removed,if the part about euron killingtorturing the sand snakes is true i may actually cum in my pants during that episode
asoiaf,removed,what exactly did i spoil i never made any mention about anything from season other than using the words season and is it not clear based on the last scene all of us saw of davos and jon from season where davos is standing with his sword chanting king in the north that he is on his side
asoiaf,removed,when jon toots the horn it will simultaneously raise the wall higher and give control of a dragon though the tooting may secondtrue death jon
asoiaf,removed,this is so stupid
asoiaf,removed,grab them right by the poosey
asoiaf,removed,thank you so much
asoiaf,removed,it isnt and you just misgendered her you fucking shitlord s
asoiaf,removed,til lots of people love seeing the spoilers this fucking blows my mind its a mystery you tards youre intentionally encrappefying the story for yourself
asoiaf,removed,youre an idiot
asoiaf,removed,if davos in the book follows in the show maybe davos and then dany will provide jons story like ifwhen book stannis dies sorry rdragonstone and davos needs a new king but i still think hes gonna spend some time in ghost im wondering if hell be really happy in ghost and then pissed he gets pulled back in his stupid bastard body
asoiaf,removed,of course it was released it was written by a hardworking writer who was immune to the trappings of fame and cared only for the series named elio garcia
asoiaf,removed,it was made by elio garcia i really hope martin doesnt give them another chance id much rather have martin have write and fact check any book related to asoiaf himself along with a ghost writer rather than hand it over to some fanboy wannabies
asoiaf,removed,there were signs but there is always room for hope and it took until after stannis burning shireen for me to realize that the got i started watching and the got i am going to end up watching are going to fall victim to the hbo take the risk for a couple of seasons make sure it gains an audience then poop out dialogue and plot sequences until its over formula which is fine i dont mind it its still a neat story but man if they stuck with the writing quality and detail of the first few seasons wed be here foreverwouldnt that be great
asoiaf,removed,yeah asshair was going to be in the books now it wont be great theory
asoiaf,removed,egyptian arabic i think you meant terroristy jk but seriously
asoiaf,removed,someone already mentioned jon coming back
asoiaf,removed,triggered
asoiaf,removed,if you are going to stare down the evidence and deny it thats fine but i got no time for people who cant see what is plain in front of them
asoiaf,removed,nopeople at dancing with the dragons not of the dragons in twow we will see the second dance of dragons tyrion quentyn arianne whole esssos looks at dany greykoysmartells and aegon as well
asoiaf,removed,a trump always pays himself first nah not catchy enough
asoiaf,removed,im not imparting or imposing a modern morality on any figure in the show youll notice i am not condemning the characters what i am saying is that there were certain intentions in displaying these scenes that didnt work out and i think it is due to acting i didnt make up what these scenes were supposed to make us feel i am saying that the directorswriters intended reactions that they largely failed to get find me the person horrified by danys speech for example the director said himself that horror was what he was trying to make the audience feel if you dont like the acting thats on you but i dont need anyone telling me i should be horrified arya is finally getting justice for her families murder or dany preparing to take back what is rightfully hers or sansa getting justice for ramsay raping her killing her little brother and burning her home chill the fuck out youre not the center of the rasoiaf universe no one is fucking telling you what to do im talking about the intention of the scenes versus the effect of the scenes
asoiaf,removed,could be her acok arc wasnt as strong as agot or asos dance though if i were to make a novella out of a pov in that book itd probably be jons wow acronym city on this post
asoiaf,removed,first book of trilogy originally ended with rw
asoiaf,removed,i sniff my fingers after i drop a shit dont wipe neither
asoiaf,removed,glad somebody was surprised
asoiaf,removed,im just a stinky little asshole
asoiaf,removed,already been posted still stupid
asoiaf,removed,oh god
asoiaf,removed,if you believed this would happen you truly are an idiot
asoiaf,removed,i would ask for proof that you have brains but given that you think this is subtle i think you already provided all the proof i need
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,its not wow ramsey doesnt marry sansa in the book he marries her friend who she was sitting with in ep at the feast for robert in winterfell they pass her off as arya but shes just a close family friend whose age and looks match
asoiaf,removed,you werent the only one who read neds beheading the red wedding red vipers death etc plus we all know grrm said the ending was bittersweet
asoiaf,removed,cant you shitpost in rgameofthrones
asoiaf,removed,sure loras was a perjure arrogant sodomite oathbreaker and also violater of his sacred vows taken in his religious office as a knight i support the same harshness to be used against clergy who dishonor their office to face physical punishment harshly in accord with their crimes
asoiaf,removed,aw its retarded
asoiaf,removed,cool dont give a fuck about your shitty wifes opinions
asoiaf,removed,who cares what she thinks do you have nothing better to do than write a fucking essay onto a forum about a fantasy show
asoiaf,removed,drogo never raped dany and he never hit her either wtf are you talking about
asoiaf,removed,without having seen a preston video in a really long time because hes a maniac
asoiaf,removed,because hes a loony
asoiaf,removed,that made you dislike lf i fucking love that guy i hope he wins i want lf on the iron throne while dany sansa arya missendei asha and melisandre are chained up in his bedchamber as his harem
asoiaf,removed,there are plenty of swords on the throne stanniss head could be on one of them and shireen can be in littlefingers harem too
asoiaf,removed,i believe that season spoiled almost nothing from the books totally agree but for a different reason by now books coming out at all are about as likely as trump presidency
asoiaf,removed,well written the novels are all about gratuitous shocks entire characters are created and killed off just to provide gratuitous shocks now that all of the main characters have invulnerable plot armor
asoiaf,removed,fruit already ripen year ago you need to do is get off you ass and make jam out of it
asoiaf,removed,heath ledger as rhaegar because theyre both dead
asoiaf,removed,something about this comment feels strange
asoiaf,removed,eh i reject that notion look at tyrion and daenerys to see what direction jon is going theyre turning into ruthless and somewhat villainous people they have a character arc where that makes sense jon is a brooding outsider with a magic sword an albino wolf pet and every other character turns into an idiot in his presence to facilitate his storyline the idea that mance would have played along as happens in the plot is immersion breaking and idiotic thats one example all of his interactions are equally stupid also you should take an english class i have a phd from princeton soim going to go out on a wild limb and say that my understand of literary analysis exceeds yours there are a lot of methods people use to analyze literature and higher meanings dont have to be intentional by the author for them to be there although i dont do analysis that way i see you also gave a big fuck you to basic sentence structure you are a rebel my friend
asoiaf,removed,riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,is content like this allowed by the mods op is clearly giving the middlefinger to the entirety of the subreddit
asoiaf,removed,pods sworn to brienne ya dingus
asoiaf,removed,sorry ya respected mod no offense was meant to any dinguses
asoiaf,removed,i dont mind first wave femmism but i cant stand second and third wave femmism
asoiaf,removed,england was included and so was a lot of irrelevant bullshit the crusades was english manpower not involved in the crusades not significantly at all aside from richard i no theres a reason crusaders got dubbed franks african monks at ipswich not monks but as far as im aware monk one possibly african monk does not in any way indicate that english society was anything but absolutely white not to mention that the scandinavian world the one trading with persia and the arab world included large parts of england for some time and commerce does not demonstrate migrant penetration no more than roman coins in china establish a roman presence in the far east for all your selfaggrandising attitude you seem to have a tenuous grasp on proper methodology no understanding of logical processes and a taste for the salacious and the diverse
asoiaf,removed,its called listening to what they are saying and frankly it is horrifying second and third wace femmism want the complete destruction of the nuclear family want abortion on demand even if the baby is perefectly viable third wave femmist for this part men to be imprisoned in conentration camps want masculinity to be abolished and belive all men are rapists
asoiaf,removed,while were on the topic of derivations of names heres something i found in the massive and endlessly interesting winterfell huis clos we all know that abel mances minstrel alterego is an anagram of bael as in bael the bard but it never occurred to me that bael has the characteristic ae found in so many targaryen names heres the passage hence it seems that at least one targaryen has been sent to the wall moreover this happened at least a hundred years ago since the shieldhall has been abandoned since then it happened before brynden rivers came to the wall with aemon so neither of them is a viable candidate for the targaryen exiled to the watch the targaryens arrived in westeros a three hundred years ago which completes the delimitation of the timeframe of the mysterious dragonknight the characteristic diphthong of the targaryens tempts me to relate bael the bard to this mysterious exile bael seems to have lived during the timeframe we defined
asoiaf,removed,i always assumed khal was picked up from the khan of mongols it is op is a tard
asoiaf,removed,i didnt realise you were a peasant maester or generic noble in the seven kingdoms postthe war of five kings but if you felt that applied to you ok eryeah run with that
asoiaf,removed,ah yes i see
asoiaf,removed,yup hes a an imbred mongoloid was always destined to be fucked up of course not all inbred targs are but quite a few are given he was genetically fucked up imo he had no chance of ever being a reasonable person
asoiaf,removed,sounds like a thread on stormfront explaining why white people are persecuted in america and jews control the world lol
asoiaf,removed,jon snow hopefully will stay away from the iron throne he doesnt belong there the show is bothering me a lot making jon the main character stannis should be the one on the throne if he dies daenerys should be crowned queen i love catelyns povs i love cerseis povs
asoiaf,removed,whenever i see one of these terms in a post or a comment i almost always decide that the poster is a turd and has smelly turd ideas posts like yours are certainly exceptions this is wrong so before i do this i try to remember that i didnt spend bookoo bucks on a degree that forced me to talk like that and that there are people that probably think that my ideas are like a big wet bucket full of liquid turds that splashes on their shoes so maybe i should get off of my high automaton horse trope
asoiaf,removed,ah preston jacobs the alex jones of the asoiaf fandom not in the racist way just in the giant leaps to fulfill his own delusions way
asoiaf,removed,it seems that jon will marry dany and after kill her to be azor ahai the leaks are already confirming the first part
asoiaf,removed,i started reading them after series and finished them halfway through series i have to say the casting in the show is fantastic theres very few characters that i felt didnt match their book descriptions the main one being tyrion as i think hes meant to be a lot ugliermore repulsive in the books especially after losing his nose but for the most part when new cast members are introduced preseason im always pleasantly surprised
asoiaf,removed,yeah no preston goes into incredible detail about everything and he has such faith in grrm as a writer that he is blinded to the fact that no book could be as ever connected as he wants it to be sure it might be fun and it was until this last season of got to watch his videos until you realize that you are participating in a lone individual obsessive compulsive behavior that has no real end point
asoiaf,removed,imagine the savagery that would arise if they just threw a fake dead daenerys screenshot around the internet wouldnt even be hard just throw a bit of fake blood on her face and make her lay down simple but the collective butthurt would be glorious
asoiaf,removed,the episode by episode break down is pretty damn huge after youve read it you might not think so most of the events arent major as such but prespoilers none of us knew how the season would play out some people might have predicted it but once youve read the spoilers the surprise is gone my favourite episodes have been those ive gone into blind i only wish i had the willpower to turn away spoilers
asoiaf,removed,if you cant recognise thatthis is moronic lol
asoiaf,removed,sure if you ignore the fact that it had no elements of a song of ice and fire in it all action and no substance no plotting or intrigue made me feel like i was watching an action movie i dont watch got for market town chases dragons battles and explosions although botb was amazing cinematography half of the season didnt even make sense of course these are my opinions which people here like to forget hence downvotes so take them how you will
asoiaf,removed,you sound exactly like donald trump in the debate except youre telling the truth wrong i didnt say that i did not
asoiaf,removed,ill take out chases and you can approve it or not but im not changing anything else out of principle this just in there are dragons battles and explosions in season and and and and and
asoiaf,removed,man im trembling and almost crying guys im excited too but come on its a tv show
asoiaf,removed,so james is on the inside he knows whats going on i think since we know he reads this sub and has done an ama here he read those plot leaks uawayforthelads made up and my take was him confirming they were fake
asoiaf,removed,theres literally a dragon a battle and an explosion in the banner at the top of the subreddit
asoiaf,removed,im trembling and almost crying are you okay
asoiaf,removed,i spelt everything correctly im assuming youre referring to recognise in which case you should revise the english language as in english this is spelt with an s
asoiaf,removed,youre being incredibly picky
asoiaf,removed,im most confident about bronn at least in the show
asoiaf,removed,considering the leaker has predicted every single thing we have seen so far correctly weeks in advance id say so
asoiaf,removed,pfft up votes and some comments fucking confirmed
asoiaf,removed,welp been doing real good avoiding spoilers and accidentally clicked this so fuck you guys and fuck me fuck
asoiaf,removed,uawayforthelads died for our sins
asoiaf,removed,oh no youre being bullied with downvotes for talking out your ass and presenting it as fact that sounds hard
asoiaf,removed,my fat fucking cock
asoiaf,removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
asoiaf,removed,they are gooks like us httpiimgurcomwpplfgcjpg
asoiaf,removed,no the boat info was very specific and included a character who normally doesnt travel with those folks
asoiaf,removed,holy shit you sound like such a faggot fallen on sad days the author literally tells us on multiple occasions that jamie is one of if not best living swordsman in the seven kingdoms
asoiaf,removed,rhaegar is a cuck rhaegar confirmed as ctr shill
asoiaf,removed,ban the guy fagging up the joint
asoiaf,removed,the nights king
asoiaf,removed,grab em by the myrish swamp you can do anything
asoiaf,removed,hillary unlike cersei without a doubt knows history policy and reality and shes not a drunk bill might be not hillary also cersei isnt coke head
asoiaf,removed,cersei didnt care much about her husband committing adultery neither did hillary however i dont think cersei would be as evil as to defend her husbands rape victims if robert were to rape somebody
asoiaf,removed,yeah first hand knowledge
asoiaf,removed,the red god obviously hes the only one who delivers okay besides the god of tits and wine as pointed out
asoiaf,removed,trump is more like joffrey i feel
asoiaf,removed,hillary clinton fixed it for you
asoiaf,removed,if you actually bothered to watch the entire video trump says that he has their consent
asoiaf,removed,add hillary clinton
asoiaf,removed,theres a pdf compilation of them somewhere
asoiaf,removed,hillary clinton she a big fat liar does anything to keep her family in power hates logic and honorable northmen eddard sanders
asoiaf,removed,hillary easily only cares about themselves and power
asoiaf,removed,robbs honor ned would have never cancelled his marriage to a frey
asoiaf,removed,you can read the whole series online heres a link to affc httpwwwreadbooksvampirecomgeorgerrmartinafeastforcrowshtml
asoiaf,removed,what does anything on this sub have to do with tinfoil
asoiaf,removed,as i suspected a great number of asoiaf readers are white supremacists this thread is evidence
asoiaf,removed,this is the worst hillary clinton add ive ever seen﻿ lol
asoiaf,removed,this sounds so lame that i would literally vomit if this shit happened well fuck you too i mean i appreciate the effort you just put in to typing that but almost all the shitnyou wrote is just complete garbage again fuck you too also lyanna is years old and i dont think evn in westeros they get berothed this early youre confusing betrothed with married if you ever read asoiaf it happens engagements were not to be consummated until both parties were of age plus why would an heir to a minor house like the mormonts get to marry a stark bastard not just any stark bastard the king in the north lyanna was the first to support jon and sansas cause remained so throughout the battle we dont know if the umbers or karstarks are attained through like they still might get to keep their lands as jon doesnt seem like a mass murderer of innocents the umbers gave rickon to ramsay and the karstarks openly followed the boltons after rickard karstark lost his head to robb sansa will shout for their heads and i do not believe jon will disagree what better way for the new king of winter to reward faithful followers than with the lands of his traitorous bannermen btw they are not innocent i am a huge fan of the show and i would legit stop watching if they tried to pull this nonsense one less shitposter i wont weep
asoiaf,removed,alright man sorry you speak english well i wouldnt have expected you to live in poor country without access to basic sites they are probably checked out at the library but a lot of libraries now offer audio books online you could torrent them as well if your set on pirating or what not
asoiaf,removed,i just searched for a free download and it was one of the first few links
asoiaf,removed,edd lord commander of the nights watch
asoiaf,removed,king robb the young wolf king in the north and king of the trident actually now i need to get this tag for robb
asoiaf,removed,i know this wont be taken very well here but i will probably torrent it cause im fucking sick of being strung along even if it takes a month to find a pdf
asoiaf,removed,dont do that one day you may find your dog beheaded by some psycho
asoiaf,removed,cause he hasnt been well paid cut the shit its not done because he is lazy yeah yeah hes a gardener and all that i have bought all the books at least twice even more i have bought all the digital books and the soft copies even bought them for friends so they could get into the series plus the hbo subscriptions for the last five years im not gonna torrent it cause he doesnt deserve it im going to yet rent it cause im tired of the bullshit
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,how is this shit upvoted
asoiaf,removed,this thread has been removed because its title contains spoilers for more information on how to title threads please see you may repost your thread with nonspoilery title
asoiaf,removed,the sidebar says we have an emphasis on the books a showonly theory has no place
asoiaf,removed,i hate these stupid questions about romance this is a story of power violence war and extinction what the shit is jonsa i hate it when a bunch of frustrated nimwits come on here asking questions about shipping dipping and snipping
asoiaf,removed,not to my knowledge
asoiaf,removed,i could care less about where this came from just want it to be over
asoiaf,removed,just remember that daario and euron are the same person i know the show doesnt make it clear and it may be hard to pick up on in the books but if you know this then you get a lot more insight into the story
asoiaf,removed,lol fag s
asoiaf,removed,where would you like me these little fuckers follow me around everywhere looking for some shit idk
asoiaf,removed,no he never fit in with the starks because hes an asshole considering what an asshole he obviously is its amazing they treated him so well as they did robb had him as his main lieutenant as he campaigned and youre right jon and theon had incredibly different lives jons was much worse despite him being a much better person than theon
asoiaf,removed,did i stumble into rasoiafcirclejerk how do you manage to type after jerking grrm off that much
asoiaf,removed,yea he should have a name like shaniqua reyesel nazir then hed be a humble black muslim lesbian eskimo instead of an inherently evil educated white man
asoiaf,removed,oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,of course you hate her this is reddit the loser white male stannis is praised and any female character has to be hated otherwise it wont be reddit every character including stannis ned robb commit a more blunder than her but who do you hate cat of course
asoiaf,removed,feel free to go on and are you cat because you are taking this a bit to heart mate
asoiaf,removed,ser was probably poisoned by our enemies or will curl up in a ball and give up on life with tommen gone
asoiaf,removed,no you fascist say the real reason you want me to selfcensor btw ive screenshotted this exchange and can send it to every conservative site and board in the world in a matter of minutes you fascist filth apologize and admit your error in judgment
asoiaf,removed,thanks for bringing that up again for not reason whatsoever after one day of it not being discussed i had nearly forgotten about it
asoiaf,removed,if i was trolling it would be obvious i made a light hearted joke
asoiaf,removed,no answer as expected sometimes the urge to fit in trumps all women have been the biggest enemies of women throughout history for every guy who oppresses there are some women who aid in that just to fit in
asoiaf,removed,theres no argument so theres no hole muslims are worse by a lot would you like links to different recent stories of them committing acts of terrorism rape child rape elderly rape child sex grooming human trafficking slavery sexual slavery genocide spousal abuse female genital mutilation murder of homosexuals punishment of women for having been raped exploitation of western welfare states why are you protecting monsters are you in favor of little french girls being run over by trucks while carrying their dolls and trying to watch the fireworks with their families are you in favor of swedish girls being groped and raped en masse at concerts german women being sexually assaulted and raped during new years celebrations atrisk british children in literally every sizable british town being hooked on drugs and made into sex slaves for pakistani migrants elderly austrian women being anally raped outdoors in broad daylight by yo muslim migrants a somali migrant convicted rapist being released only to be found days later going up and down the street in london trying to lure young girl after girl what about muslims groping so many european children in public pools that many have had to ban them you in favor of all that then dont try to keep people from saying it
asoiaf,removed,my father hates when people laugh at my family so instead of being funny i shall do a flip and fuck a whore seals are petty dope though for sure and not nearly as rapey as dolphins or krakens
asoiaf,removed,whatever that means to the commonfolk right those guys are idiots ps note to the mods i dont meant idiots in an offensive manner unless you are offended by my comment then ser duck you
asoiaf,removed,two separate mods recommended i not argue with you because youre a troll well im not a troll and you have no reason to say this except to make me feel bad i hope that makes you feel better its not convincing to you thats cool to reiterate it is not for your benefit that i comment people liked my initial comments and thats all that matters to me
asoiaf,removed,ive read this entire conversation and i have to say that you are incredibly annoying to even observe having a conversation with someone you hide behind rhetoric instead of voicing any opinion of substance youre just nitpicking this guys word choices and practicing your logical arguments without really discussing the theories he brings up youre arguing for the sake of argument do you enjoy it that much im commenting to give you a reality check you brought whatever hurt youve experienced upon yourself
asoiaf,removed,are people really getting their panties in such a twist over this do we really need a massive explanation on a theory as to why dont you have jobs lives to worry about
asoiaf,removed,somehow bloodraven has something to do with it i bet
asoiaf,removed,grrm we need twow
asoiaf,removed,george pls
asoiaf,removed,yeah i learned reddit is filled with pedantic assholes who cant differentiate between casual conversation and in depth discourse on linguistic history pardon me for not assuming that the average asoiaf reader possesses encyclopedic knowledge of indogermanic linguistics and phrasing my original comment accordingly
asoiaf,removed,go read twilight
asoiaf,removed,does anyone actually think this series will be resolved before his death he might as well just stop now and enjoy the rest of his life because he aint finishing the series
asoiaf,removed,if this comes out in ill suck a homeless mans infected dick and live stream it
asoiaf,removed,oh sorry man with all the grrm apologists around here its hard to tell when someone is joking or being a blind fanboy
asoiaf,removed,get in my boats lets row like gender to santa fe knock down his door and steal his dos computer
asoiaf,removed,id put money on the last book being published posthumously
asoiaf,removed,as soon as martin saw that bill clinton would ascend the throne he knew that hillary would be the one to set off the wildfire cache beneath the capitol building we know its there because of obamas pov chapters
asoiaf,removed,ohu sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,i like elio a lot but lynda she has issues i was amused when it was discovered she uses all of her free time playing that second life game esp all the weird digital sex
asoiaf,removed,when you attend a university and actually earn it
asoiaf,removed,damn we need the new book
asoiaf,removed,you write this wall of text but are too lazy to give it an proper title u serious
asoiaf,removed,can we please go with any other way to pose this question than fixed you fix animals and livestock the comparison you make is disgusting
asoiaf,removed,ok you have to be a troll of some sort a sword by definition is not a finished product it can still be a work in progress what does that even mean i feel like you are some weird asoiaf version of the chinese room you just pick and choose words and put them together to almost form sentences you might fail the turing test
asoiaf,removed,so danys a tranny
asoiaf,removed,well my wife and i do every night im reek and shes farya
asoiaf,removed,because dd are white and white people are racist duh
asoiaf,removed,hey fuck you cunt
asoiaf,removed,i mean if you get pissed over a theory youre a special kind of bitch so i wouldnt worry about it only thing that gets on my nerves when it comes to asoiaf is when people passionately use inbook logic to make ridiculous claims like winterfell is sansasaryasrickons birthright like if that is how they actually feel about it then dam n how easy are you to corrupt in real life no one is inherently entitled to anything and birthright is fucking stupid sorry for the rant
asoiaf,removed,downvoted you because this doesnt contribute to the discussion
asoiaf,removed,tertiary not ternery dumbass
asoiaf,removed,i was trying to think realistically about grrm writing the winds of winter and a dream of spring now call me optimistic but i think once twow is complete ados will be fairly easier for him to write bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
asoiaf,removed,if say delusional fits best
asoiaf,removed,i feel ya mon i amwas a huge asoiaffan but the wait for the next book and the fact that i didnt like adwd that much has made me very underhyped for twow and the fucking show just pissed me off last season the terrible dornearc jaime being a fucking idiot arya ending up at the twins and killing fully grown men without breaking a sweat the next season is probably gonna start off with arya borrowing lfs jetpack and blasting off to kl and all her enemies over there and dany god i hate her such a boring character and emilia clarke is a fucking awful actress keeping my thumbs crossed for her career to be over after got so i dont have to see her stupid face again
asoiaf,removed,okay donald trump
asoiaf,removed,the best spoilers ever a tremendous amount of spoilers believe me im the best at spoilers simply tremendous
asoiaf,removed,when she turned mad maybe it started with joffs dead but had no real power to do any mad things until her father died when she started showing behavior that could be labeled social disorder all of her life
asoiaf,removed,i think she has narcissistic or borderline personality disorder maybe both its hard to say she killed her best friend when she was eleven so its pretty clear shes been not right from the get go id say tyrion threatening your joy shall turn to ashes your mouth joffs death really set here off though thats what convinced her the valonqar prophecy was true and fueled her paranoia
asoiaf,removed,to be honest fuck you and fuck your civility policy theres too many morons that visit this sub spouting out either stupid questions because they were too busy tweeting about how theyre watching the show so their friends will accept them socially instead of actually paying attention to the show or shitty harebrained tinfoil hat theories based on zero observations about the show or story structure but instead the craziest unsupported thing their useless walnut sized brain could put together while i dont agree with anyone being mean to someone even on the internet for their own enjoyment i shouldnt have to be forced to be nice to someone whos clearly an idiot because itll hurt their feelings boo hoo if one is going to publicly vomit shitty show theories because of their childish need for karma points and attention or whatever then im going to let them know i believe theyre an imbecile what you should be doing in my opinion is threatening to ban those people so my front page wont be overflowing with selfcongratulatory posts stating obvious points of foreshadowing or what i can only assume are the mentally ill smashing their face against a keyboard rearranging a few letters and calling it a spoiler theory
asoiaf,removed,all i can tell you is one of them is rickon
asoiaf,removed,thatll officially end the stark line right
asoiaf,removed,neither is being a cunt
asoiaf,removed,wtf dude
asoiaf,removed,op and doucher mods fail bigtime by having spoilers in the title ffs
asoiaf,removed,so give it to him youre like that annoying guy in public chat with camgirls who keeps begging other people to tip the model so shell finally put something in her butt
asoiaf,removed,its happening hes dying fuck
asoiaf,removed,lmao you obviously have no idea how the world works xerox corp is failing and has lost billion in market share since ursula burns took over who do they blame everyone who sells for xerox equipment and all the inner workings or the person at the head of the ship if the cavs fail to win the championship who will get the heat of the blame lebron or everyone else lebron will shed the blame but media and every sports fan out there will blame lebron the people who get all the credit when things go right are also the ones who have to take the heat when things go badly if your a manager and your team is short of proper expectations your boss isnt going to care if it was someone on your team who was lacking heshe is going to go after the person who oversees all those people because its their fault for allowing their people to fail the manager chose to put those people in those people in those positions and if they fail its the managers fault plain and simple that is how the world works dd put those people in those positions so if they fuck up then dd also fuck up for not correcting those mistakes or putting better people in the position youre obviously a fuck tard and have no understanding of how blame is assigned so you are welcome for the life lesson
asoiaf,removed,he owes you nothing twat its not like youve preordered twow
asoiaf,removed,i was upset about how dd tend to fuck a lot of things up someone wanted to call me a year old for blaming the people who should be rightfully blamed i wrote the summary not an essay on how blame works throughout the world since they obviously dont understand how that concept works and then want to refer to someone as a year old for their opinion on the matter but you dont see that do you you think i wrote the summary because of the reuse of an extra open your eyes
asoiaf,removed,whaooooooooooooooooooooo this is sooooooo deepppp bruh
asoiaf,removed,you and melisandre should both take up new professions since youre predictions are shit
asoiaf,removed,he is the most irritating person alive
asoiaf,removed,not only that but in this scene its her firstborn telling her that hes going to put that very reminder as the heir to the family inheritance over her other children thats trying to so hard not to admit are most likely dead or will be within a year also he will hold the office that her late husband and firstborn held its like why jeb bush hated trump so much jeb loved and respected his father brother and the actual office of potus now this undeserving bastard trump is trying to take it and can possibly make the whole thing a mockery a joke
asoiaf,removed,hours ago a mod posted in the title spoiled thread that to discuss their decision to post in here this seems to be the first post made about that i really dont see any discussion about it from the mods besides one post asking how a person avoids spoilers i feel that episode titles should not be in thread titles are we allowed to put chapter titles thread titles if i were to ask about an arya chapter from adwd wouldnt that spoil that she lives till that book the fact that people reported it and it was decided that it should be kept is a huge fuck up its like russian roulette yes many of the titles in a season dont spoil anything but some do wouldnt it be better to put the gun away so no one gets hurt rather than keep playing the game because will be fine
asoiaf,removed,stop complaining and catch up to the rest of us
asoiaf,removed,the fact that their actors dont look very much like the descriptions in the books should also work towards that especially tyrion postblackwater
asoiaf,removed,his sickness escalates to something more serious and he dies
asoiaf,removed,hes being kind of an asshole youve got to admit
asoiaf,removed,faggot
asoiaf,removed,jeez you were subscribing to his emails do yourself a favor dont think about his unpublished got books move on read other stuff if he publishes it then read it if not then oh well
asoiaf,removed,can you fuckin douchers stop including yettobereleased episode names in titles they are spoilers
asoiaf,removed,we wuz kings n shit
asoiaf,removed,fk you guys are salty get a fking life until the book comes this tread is basically retards trying to write the best joke about martin in hope of karma while crying over a fucking book like little spoiled first world bitches and that is what most of you clearly are this is a sad fucking sub reddit so let me see them down votes
asoiaf,removed,first of all how is season close to anyones heart its just people grasping as straws looking for a reason to bitch
asoiaf,removed,i am struggling to find this theory posted on this subweird since its already been posted a times i guess you are incapable of searching arya and jaqen in the searchbox weird here are just a few of the of posts on this subject just from the past days
asoiaf,removed,she started saying you know nothing jon snow well before they ever slept together though
asoiaf,removed,im more than a little concerned about his illness dont die george
asoiaf,removed,removed if you edit out the namecalling of groups of fans we can reapprove
asoiaf,removed,httpiimgurcomvfkwhebgif im dying and have decided to cancel winds of winter
asoiaf,removed,you know nothing is a way of showing hoe little he knows about wildling culture and how many prejudices he has during the course of asos jon is having those prejudices disproved by ygrrite which is where she says the iconic phrase
asoiaf,removed,havent you seen the other hundred threads on this already
asoiaf,removed,dude you need to relax not everyone is going to agree with your theories there are theories with much more impressive evidence than you have shown that i dont believe you havent proven anything you rely on lazy assumptions like she didnt say your valonqar that means it has to be tommen thats so logically wrong i dont even want to get into it then you rely on absurdities to prove why you are right like tommen will be resurrected i mean i guess he could be reanimated as a wight and kill cersei but then again i guess euron could be daario what are you showing me i still dont understand its so clear to me its amazing how you cant see the basic syntax its a very logical progression first the kid dies then she mourns then the valonqar strikes the fact that its split up by she said doesnt mean the logical progression is broken up explain your case clearly because right now all you have done is basically wagged your finger at me angrily because i dont agree with you i mean you didnt even use the original quote when you were making your initial argument you relied on your own interpretation of that quote to prove your point
asoiaf,removed,thanks captain prick i already admitted i was wrong
asoiaf,removed,wtf is the point of using a spoiler tag if you add the spoiler to the fucking titlethumbnail
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,this should be on motley monday come on mods
asoiaf,removed,these niggas need occams razor although i love all the hypeposting
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,i always said these jews ruined stannis in the show because too many people liked him and he is not kind of guy they want goys to like
asoiaf,removed,maragret cho cho motherfuckers get hype
asoiaf,removed,brahs clegane bowl is happening just not the way you think it will sandor will not be in kings landing and there will be no trial by combat cersei is going to destroy the faith in the sept via wildfire or some other coocoo qyburninfluenced plan this will purposefully kill the high sparrow the sparrows ser loras and probably lady margery as well tommen and cersei will watch the sept burn and tommen will be stricken by grief due to margaerys death hell kill himself via toaster in bathtub not srs but he will probably kill himself cersei doesnt know what to do but run her and the mountain qyburn will probably be dead by now will retreat from kings landing into the riverlands where her only allyfriendfamily in the entire world isjaime however shell never make it to riverrunthe twinswherever jaime will be while in the riverlands cersei and the mountain will conviently run into sandor obviously the hound aka the valonqar aka little brother wins and proceeds to choke cersei to death fulfilling maggy the frogs prophecy
asoiaf,removed,hey fucker guess what imdb was right bitch
asoiaf,removed,i try to keep on watchingreading westerosorgs review since elio decided to pass on the show but i just cant for the life of me seem to endure her personality what a horrible bitter conceited smug and spiteful person she is
asoiaf,removed,well shit by whom is there some sort of a guideline like dont be a jerk to linda that would be equivalent to a dont feed the troll policy somehow
asoiaf,removed,in the timeline is is the real hound or rorgehoundhelm hound
asoiaf,removed,this is against our silly content policy and im going to remove it you might think about reposting it to mondays motely thread instead
asoiaf,removed,i agree with most of yours i would add wun wun to the list i think there were reports of him dying at winterfell i think kevan and pycelle are going to get killed by varys birds too otherwise whats the point of having kevan coming back
asoiaf,removed,my problem with this theory at least in episode is that they didnt look for the hound they may have seen him but when it came time to attack the settlement the bortherhood just killed its people and left why didnt they look for the hound its not like he was miles away
asoiaf,removed,madmax ii cant storm the thorn
asoiaf,removed,ramsey bolton beat to death by jon snow or eaten by his own hounds thanks to rickon warging into them small jon umber killed by tormund rickon killed by ramsey either shot with an arrow or burned and flayed edd when the wall falls walder fray someone needs to kill this fool edmure i dont see him getting out of this blackfish yea i dont see him getting out either pycelle kevan and maybe the queen of throns if she isnt already dead killed by little birds lancel killed by ungregor the waif killed by arya somehow
asoiaf,removed,the north ramsay bolton pretty much a given sansa releasing the hounds on him would be a nice twist rickon stark killed before the battle wouldnt be surprised if hes one of the bodies on the flaming xs riverlands house frey thats right everyone dies while celebrating the capture of riverrun and the supposed death of blackfish black walder lothar walder everyone dies lem lemoncloak by the hound with an axe the rest of the brotherhood without banners see above kings landing a whole lot of sparrows frankenmountain smash lancel lannister see above septa unella see above many civilians in kings landing see above kevan lannister taken out by qyburns birds pycelle taken out by qyburns birds braavos the waif arya stabs her and flees the city waif returns to house of black white and is killed by jaqen something crazy is going to happen in kings landing before the season is over part of me wonders if once cersei sets frankenmountain loose will she be able to control him could see qyburn being killed like frankenstein turning on his creator could also see cersei doing something very foolish with the great sept brans vision showed wildfire although that couldve been regarding the mad king or the blackwater and cersei has repeatedly said shed burn cities to the ground to protect her family if she burns down kings landing id add the high sparrow olenna tyrell loras tyrell mace tyrell and margery tyrell to the list margerys death could be the catalyst that drives tommen over the edge as well
asoiaf,removed,i made a post about this and this was what i thought the reasoning behind them killing the folks searching for sandor check it out
asoiaf,removed,chill nigga
asoiaf,removed,a girl is whoever girl needs to be clinton campaign in a nutshell
asoiaf,removed,and what about calling others people posts shitty posts
asoiaf,removed,that is by far the worst thing ive read today i dunno youre dropped quite a few turd nuggets in this thread alone
asoiaf,removed,please shut the fuck up you over moderating piece of human shit
asoiaf,removed,wen bok cum out you said cum
asoiaf,removed,so basically cersei aint dead yet ugh end my suffering please
asoiaf,removed,id be more surprised but those are probably the same masses that questioned whether jon would be brought back to life you cant outforeshadow stupid
asoiaf,removed,this is called delusional
asoiaf,removed,basically everyone at kl is republican and they dont know about the ww
asoiaf,removed,grrm is a dick at this point just finish the book already you hbo dick
asoiaf,removed,and you sound like a cunt and get up votes what strange times these are indeed
asoiaf,removed,are you saying that just because someone doesnt have a dick theyre incapable of love fuck you man grey worm and missandei evar
asoiaf,removed,so youd rather have cersei drawn and quartered publicly than make her walk naked publicly i want her dead more than anything but shed have to do the walk first the latter is complete thank the gods the only good thing shes ever done is ask for ned to be sent to the wall instead of being executed and she halfassed that and i support trump so i wouldnt either i would hillary tho but i wouldnt watch ew
asoiaf,removed,migraines will not be a problem for him now since he doesnt have a head
asoiaf,removed,no it isnt whatre you
asoiaf,removed,what you suggest sounds awful like something from xena warrior princess im glad youre just an armchair director
asoiaf,removed,there are some pretty heavy spoilers regarding tormunds fate if you believe the previous leakers and theyve been right thus far
asoiaf,removed,meera reed and bran stark are still being chased by a group of wights and the wights are catching up meera is exhausted and is about to give up on bran a man on a horseback with a flaming sword kills a couple of wights with it and the rest after dismounting from his horse a close up shows the man to be neds brother benjen stark whod left the wall in season bran is still in his visions and meera doesnt recognize him he says he knows whats happened and they need to take bran to castle black this scene is well shot the crowd at kings landing has gathered at the red keep for margaerys atonement the hs is recalling margaerys sins and margaery confesses to lying to the gods about lorass affairs and says she repents the hs says the gods have accepted her repentance and have taken her to be a servant of the seven a long speech just then the tyrell army arrives but margaery commands them to stay put the king is impressed by the high sparrows justice and agrees to use the pointed star as a part of the sigil later a furious cersei along with the mountain demands a meeting with the hs but a fight breaks out bw the mountain and the sparrow guards cersei orders the mountain to go after septa unella and he crushes her to death a vision about the death of the mad king just as jamie described to brienne young ned is the to arrive after jamie stabs the mad king and questions his honor jamie then sits on the iron throne but says he did it for robert sam and gilly arrive at horn hill his sister and mother are good people but his father is furious that he broke the vows of the nights watch by fathering a child he doesnt believe sam killed a ww and thinks the baby is his he refuses to let gilly stay sam leaves his home with gilly and on the carriage tells her he stole his fathers valyrian sword walder frey is at the twins celebrating the wedding of one of his son a raven arrives which says he can get riverrun if he agrees on one condition no word on whom the letter is from possibly lf or jaime arya arrives at the play and goes backstage shes serving wine with the poison to the actress the actress remarks that arya has the looks of a lady and offers her a position in her cast she says theyll be going to the twins for walder freys daughters wedding arya sees the opportunity to get a name off her list and spills the wine daenerys and daario are on the way to mereen and converse the khalasar see drogon above and dany is relieved that drogon is coming with them varys says dany is arriving with an army and they need to make provisions the new priestesses spread the word of dany returning as the end of darkness
asoiaf,removed,it just felt weird like were the westerosi power couple niiiiggggaaaaaa
asoiaf,removed,did i miss the part of the reagan administration when ronald committed a complete genocide against two branches of his countrymen just to prove a point
asoiaf,removed,he doesnt work on the book chapters in order so he couldve been revising an old cersei chapter
asoiaf,removed,apparently hes reading a new damphair chapter seriously excited for summaries right now
asoiaf,removed,ask him if he touches himself at night to the thought of torturing the poor souls on asoiaf by not releasing winds
asoiaf,removed,dont worry about it man grrm isnt going to live long enough to finish the series silver linings
asoiaf,removed,i am so glad to see grrm in good health lol humor it doesnt mean shit i somehow felt calm knowing that this man is still working hard and committed to giving us the remaining books hes not hes not going anywhere yes he is just not where we want him to go home to finish the books we just have to wait a bit longer by longer you mean forever i hope he stays that way for the next years at least if he stays this way for years we will be extremely lucky
asoiaf,removed,that stupid little whore got ned killed i am still rooting for her death in winds of winter
asoiaf,removed,what a pussy
asoiaf,removed,everything thing you said applies to trump
asoiaf,removed,dude get off this subreddit and keep reading lol
asoiaf,removed,replace walder frey with donald trump and reread this for extra credit they earned their feudal status by building something useful which has to be some sort of first in the history of westeros so the trumps were basically successful entrepreneurs okay but what about donald trump whys he so hated well hes ugly and infirm and really old and that never helps right but mostly its that he comes across as illtempered and kind of a dick not that people dont love those traits in attractive characters but really is donald that bad so one day donald trump was just sitting on his tower thinking about making more babies as usual when all of a sudden he hears that this young barack obama guys going around wrecking stuff with his accomplice hillary clinton so like a shrewd businessman he wrung out a bunch of concessions first most of which benefited the rest of the trumps because you gotta look out for family donald ended up swinging a bunch of sweet jobs for his sons and grandsons and even got rob stark agree to marry one of his granddaughters you could make the argument that donalds the most dedicated father in the whole books
asoiaf,removed,first of all according to grrm that was the other day and he made a post on it in that post he said hes not ready to make an announcement on winds so go occupy your time with something else
asoiaf,removed,mate youre on the first book and havent seen the show leave this sub right the fuck now please mate i dont want you to ruin this experience e for yourself
asoiaf,removed,what the fck is soccer its called football
asoiaf,removed,this sub is becoming just as bad as rgameofthrones with the shitposts
asoiaf,removed,well it breaks the rules so he didnt consider it enough this belongs in the circlejerk subreddit not here who cares what op thinks about how it breaks the rules hes clearly biased its silly hes not being serious just trying to start a circlejerk where people post anything but what actually happens
asoiaf,removed,she must try to get to westeros right
asoiaf,removed,yeah i completely agree season and are hated more by book fans because they are simply not the books their opinions are twisted by so much delusion that their opinions dont count simple as that
asoiaf,removed,i say and define a lot by the fact that as ive said um what exactly are you trying to say there ive seen these people say and admit it so i assume you have seen a lot of people say that what percentage of people would you say hate the show matter what because it isnt the books
asoiaf,removed,im not really talking about you theres another guy whos writing paragraphs in reply
asoiaf,removed,httpsgfycatcomspryfemalebluet
asoiaf,removed,snow has a really stupid expression on his face in the thumbnail looks like a retard trying to think in that particular picture
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,i want this thread to go on forever
asoiaf,removed,grrm is morbidly obese and under near constant stress i do not see him living or at a minimum being well enough to finish the series dementia or failing mental capacity almost worries me more because a subpar final product would almost make this whole ride feelpointless yes ive enjoyed the books individually but ive read reread and overanalyzed thousands of pages because im so invested in the ending ive always been in the be patient for the best product camp but i guess this survey just made me realize that im really losing all faith in the favorite author of my adult life
asoiaf,removed,so you think true varys is a moment that doesnt fit his character and never existed in the books a scene that amounts to little more than fanfiction written by other writers writers who barely seem to understand the world and source material theyve had to work off first time we truly see varys in other news ive got a fan fiction i just wrote about rhaegar totally the first time you get an accurate view at his character he was a flamboyant transsexual who liked to torture small animals in his spare time and raped lyanna what i said is only just slightly more stupid than calling an that scene true varys
asoiaf,removed,because euron is promising to make the iron islands great again and thats a compelling message to a bunch of backwater jingoistic nutjobs im gonna get the best dragons you wont believe how good these dragons are
asoiaf,removed,welcome to the waiting party enjoy your frustration and countless rereads i suggest the dunk and egg stories to sate you as well as the world of ice and fire i also really enjoy listening to the audiobooks i pick up on a lot that i just read over you can even find rips on youtube or use audible and get a free trial and book with that
asoiaf,removed,why did you get downvoted i am new to this forum and reddit i find it hilarious that people take their predictions based on unreliable inferences so seriously
asoiaf,removed,i expect theyll be back they should have just forgotten about them right now im dreading theyll team up with dany for a girl power moment
asoiaf,removed,lyanna would take one look at that thing and have to have it inside her tormund was being sarcastic regarding jons peckerthe thing is massive jon snodor confirm
asoiaf,removed,no he didnt walk out of the entire castle just out of one of the courtyards and weve seen a screenshot from the episode of someone sitting beside edd in stark gear im sure thats jon
asoiaf,removed,there is not a single word from sandor clegane about his state in affc just gushing evangelism from a cult leader in an obscure location you must be oblivious to the stance of these novels towards religion if you are buying into this beautiful ending
asoiaf,removed,ah yes i too joke about raping the sister that i hate all the time its how i show sibling love no one said he loved her im not taking a side on this one but the person youre disagreeing with simply said that he was joking about her wanting to fuck jaime and not him i also have this obsession with my first wife but its not like anyone can blame me isnt it id imagine having your first spouse weigh on your mind often is pretty normal especially if she is taken from you by death or in this case wherever whores go its not like i helped gangrape her or anything thats ridiculous he was a teenager forced presumably while surrounded by lannister guards to do it by a dad who hated him and made him do it out of spite
asoiaf,removed,totally unrelated but once i read the ahh yes in your post my brain automatically switched the rest of the post into tyrions voice it fit really well
asoiaf,removed,i really really really dislike cleganebowl you need to get hype right about now or ill have to eat every fucking chicken in this thread
asoiaf,removed,rfuckrobin
asoiaf,removed,high sparrow bernie sanders
asoiaf,removed,bernie sanders supporters s
asoiaf,removed,great more refugees
asoiaf,removed,look at me im the khal now
asoiaf,removed,if you couldnt pick that out as cgi id like you to watch this new documentary called jurassic park
asoiaf,removed,do you people ever stop bitching
asoiaf,removed,just wait till grrm does the same thing and yall freak out grrm is on record for saying the unburned bit was blood magic and a onetimething but something tells me what the author says and what the books do dont really matter much to you
asoiaf,removed,you know i think hodor is retarded because he got kicked in the head by a horse possibly caused by bran shouting like a ghosttard
asoiaf,removed,ramsay is going to die in episode at the battle of winterfell so itll all be over soon
asoiaf,removed,dd turned into real feminazis dudes are now getting the short end of the stick and women rule
asoiaf,removed,she looked way better her first naked fire scene these years have been hard on her body shes only like too i guess thats the age where women start getting eh
asoiaf,removed,why hodor is retarded like fully retarded
asoiaf,removed,damn bro what a dank observation
asoiaf,removed,unable to find the torrent of the episode please help if someone knows where to get it from
asoiaf,removed,its only a matter of timeno ears this time boob by boob comparisonslol
asoiaf,removed,youre a rather large woman you have any giant in you i dont believe so you want some har
asoiaf,removed,i am way more annoyed with how enamored got seems to be with her white savior complex and images of brown people bowing to her not that the books are a whole lot better in that regard seriously why the fuck does that trope still exist
asoiaf,removed,what the hell is the matter with you why is it a bad thing that shes white
asoiaf,removed,rumor has it that just before the battle hes allowed to run to jon and sansa only to be shot down by bolton archers
asoiaf,removed,lol all the nerds saying it was cgi
asoiaf,removed,tormund is pretty fair for a grizzly adamstype
asoiaf,removed,i will always call a racist a racist
asoiaf,removed,lol at all the people that commented on the clearly bad cgi
asoiaf,removed,i mean theyre barbaric but you wouldnt think theyre straight up fucking retarded
asoiaf,removed,its not plot breaking quite your whining
asoiaf,removed,actually it technically doesnt go against anything grrm has said youre wrong about that so come on down off your high horse
asoiaf,removed,yes random person on the internet knows better than the actual actress who did the scene how could i ever have seen this differently
asoiaf,removed,grrm confirmed pod survived his hanging thanks to brienne so at least theres that
asoiaf,removed,youre being ridiculous
asoiaf,removed,is he like forestry gump or is he like full retard
asoiaf,removed,and yet we have idiots say why isnt sam losing weight smh
asoiaf,removed,seriously whats wrong with you
asoiaf,removed,get a life dude
asoiaf,removed,in other words to convince themselves that their feelings inherently represent the right critical position on something
asoiaf,removed,because bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch moan moan moan moan moan moan moan cant be happy with anything everything isnt the way i would have made it so fuck it all to hell bitch bitch bitch
asoiaf,removed,neckbeardism
asoiaf,removed,tyrion hillary clinton confirmed
asoiaf,removed,dont worry this guys been leaving dumb comments all over the thread
asoiaf,removed,just suck on a bag of dicks
asoiaf,removed,why do u have such disdain for the breaker of chains
asoiaf,removed,i dont think anyone would recognize her or anyone else with all their flesh missing
asoiaf,removed,no stannis survived and lived his days out as a bird
asoiaf,removed,founds the guy whose never seen a naked woman before
asoiaf,removed,similarly she know has about kos for all the khals who want to seize power this means there is a large power vacuum in the ranks where everyone will think they will deserve a promotion then beyond that each dothraki sergeant underneath the kos will be vying for a position to be elevated ko and each soldier under the sergeants up to sergeant there is now a massive leadership problem in the ranks of an entire civilization of people which should lead to total civil war and dany has no real way of interrupting their bloody culture with a diplomatic process to determine who should become the next higher ranked leader and who should not
asoiaf,removed,newsflash the genres called fantasy its meant to be unrealistic you miopic manatee s
asoiaf,removed,i doubt the existant of any sort of critical process on your end
asoiaf,removed,do people actually think stannis is alive they should move on with their lives and do their duty
asoiaf,removed,then who is mcshane bringing back he literally said it is the hound or jon snow
asoiaf,removed,found the angry feminist
asoiaf,removed,he wasnt always but holy fuck yeah this nigga needs to meet the stranger
asoiaf,removed,you want a good experience with one har
asoiaf,removed,excuse you maxime is not part giant she ees just beeg boned
asoiaf,removed,epic how about retarded why do i keep watching this show when it only hurts
asoiaf,removed,told ya so
asoiaf,removed,cause you hope writers make retards script once not always this is just poor easy scripting
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,wait so it wasnt cgi or a body double the nipples that were promised
asoiaf,removed,please i still have so much denial left stannis is the chosen of fire he will be reborn amonst salt and smoke and defeat the others alternatively the show is going full retard and the books have an entirely different story line grrm loves his twists and diverging the books and show completely without telling anyone would surprise me as much as the red wedding or it was mance rayder in disguise i can stay in denial all day baby
asoiaf,removed,if you want the passive moderation let the upvotes decide model you are in the wrong subreddit been here a long time and have never had a problem until recently there is a difference between good and bad moderation and moderation that makes sense and moderation that doesnt i posit yours doesnt make any sense and you tell me the virtues of moderation and that upvotes dont matter whatsoever and threaten to ban me wonderful custodial work
asoiaf,removed,thumbs up for the pepperones
asoiaf,removed,a mod on the issue its what some users want there are plenty of other discussion threads however with good content theyre okay with seriouslabeled threads to be filled with shitposts
asoiaf,removed,am i the only one who sees cersei as hillary clinton and the high sparrow as bernie sanders in this rivalry
asoiaf,removed,great scene
asoiaf,removed,why the fuck are you on this subreddit before watching the episode
asoiaf,removed,i like this and i hope for this i noticed it too and i didnt like the simplicity of tommen speaking with cersei about his conversation that would make the hs really retard
asoiaf,removed,please dont say retarded shit like that it triggers me
asoiaf,removed,ublock origin
asoiaf,removed,are you an idiot this question is abouth the jons not alive in the books your answear is redundant
asoiaf,removed,the bear and the wildling fair
asoiaf,removed,i think that hodor is much as lennie from of mice and men big and retarded in the flashback you can see that he has a head injury
asoiaf,removed,he plays sweetrobins craziness like a balalaika
asoiaf,removed,he will loosen something up on her with that massive cock of his

asoiaf,removed,cheeky
asoiaf,removed,fuuuuuuck the books motherfucker
asoiaf,removed,har
asoiaf,removed,from my logical perspective i would go for the explanation that she processed jon was just close dead and that they are just flippin the story
asoiaf,removed,who exactly appointed you lord of critical analysis to decide what is and isnt garbage get over it the books and shows are two differnet things and should be judged accordingly you know one thing nobody has ever said about any story man the movie was soooo much better than the books you know why books are inherently better medium for conveying a story when in earth did everyone decide to become some self important wannabe critic
asoiaf,removed,rip brokhal
asoiaf,removed,you mean the targaryens who were valyrian you make no sense yes there could have been other valyrians who were flame retardant that doesnt dispute anything ive said it in fact reinforces it being the only survivor of both the doom of valyria and the destruction of the targaryen house and quite possibly the first fireproof person in hundreds of years yes shes the fucking true blood of the dragon shut the fuck up
asoiaf,removed,ah yes and when girls decide to wear revealing clothing theyre asking to be raped too right
asoiaf,removed,from some stuff ive heard be prepared for ramsay to have several other major accomplishments which are total bullshit before he dies
asoiaf,removed,she probably learned about it off screen and reacted then its not super necessary for us to see her freak out about it its not necessary for sansa whose entire story is about how harsh reality is beating her down for believing in fairy tales to react upon learning that sometimes they come true after all jfc this subreddit
asoiaf,removed,hsssssssssssssssssssssssss
asoiaf,removed,thats not unique to this season though read comprehend post
asoiaf,removed,lord tormund thundermember of tarth ftfy
asoiaf,removed,lindas twitter meltdown was fookin epic last year when that episode aired honestly made me lose a lot of respect for grrm that these two are the type of people that he keeps around
asoiaf,removed,not mondays mate its all the clueless people maybe one day youll understand
asoiaf,removed,within the context of tv fantasy good thing this shows genre is tv fantasy and not nerds jerking themselves off about their troo sword skillz knowledge
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,fuck your nice clothes what good does do they do you now high sparrow comes from the ghetto confirmed
asoiaf,removed,in this episode of dany and the andal
asoiaf,removed,yeah i loved that they left out the whole explication reunion dialogue and skipped straight to whats next good tv
asoiaf,removed,jon i died but came back sansa how jon
asoiaf,removed,lol do you know what im talking about it has to do with an arrow
asoiaf,removed,yeah i thought it was the weakest scene of the otherwise great episode and a dissapointing way to end it i mean weve had this scene about three times already it was cool the first two times and a bit dull the third time and now its just painful imo and shows how little she and her storyline has actually developed over the years also drowns my hopes of the daenerys storyline moving in a less obvious direction and actually being interesting looks like its the great queen killer of bad people conquerer of westeros storyline wed expected from series urrgghh it really frustrates me if this is really how its going then this is by far the weakest point of the series
asoiaf,removed,renly should have supported stannis he was a traitor to his own family your living in some kind of fantasy if you think renly was ever in the right stannis did the only thing he could do to stop half his army from killing the other and ruining any hope of claiming the throne from the lannisters renly created the shadow demon baby not stannis and mely sanders
asoiaf,removed,i bet you were also a stannis is alive supporter dude get real there is no umber conspiracy and obviously ramsay wrote that how the fuck would that even help smalljon betray ramsay ramsay made his intentions clear that he wanted to attack castle black please remove your helm of tin foil and join the real world
asoiaf,removed,asesswqsasayazazqazas
asoiaf,removed,i like it i posted something about the umbers possibly writing it but this gives a whole bunch more options maybe little finger is collaborating with the umbers for sansas eventual takeover i dont think hes collaborating with ramsay as that clashes with his goal of sansa ruling winterfell
asoiaf,removed,oh
asoiaf,removed,nice story bro
asoiaf,removed,i like to think it was daaaaayum son
asoiaf,removed,har
asoiaf,removed,naarf
asoiaf,removed,hm thats hot oh guess tonights gonna be rapey
asoiaf,removed,jorah are you pondering what im pondering i think so dany but do you think the scars from grayscale will be permanent i mean that one side of shireens face really never healed right
asoiaf,removed,according to the guy who spoiled alot of plot he was right with how osha dies and how dany burns every khal past episode sansa wont trust him but eventually he will save the day when the starks are losing the battle and he will bring defeat to ramsay
asoiaf,removed,they are a medieval isis with low funding obviously they are gigantic assholes that want to force their retarded agendas nobody wins as long as they are around
asoiaf,removed,dreaaaaaaaam weaver
asoiaf,removed,i made a fanfic ending for the series that has that read and comment at will
asoiaf,removed,im a little shocked that anyone could be as shocked as you are to find out that people have different opinions
asoiaf,removed,i think that you have a profound lack of empathy for the female characters of this story and will continue to feel frustrated with asoiaf as a result
asoiaf,removed,but daenarys is almost breaking the wall with her smug knowledge that she will survive anything that happens to her ugh yes when dany is giving her smug declaration to the khals she is banking on a plan that relies on no one being near her to just over power her and stop her from knocking over the braziers the braziers containing absurdly flammable and hot fuel able to instantly light wood on fire the braziers not being attached to the ground in order to prevent them from being knocked over by drunken dothraki no one just tackling her and bashing her brain in once they realized what was happening the structure being made of incredibly sturdy construction even when compromised by fire no dothraki around thinking to unbar the doors of a burning structure with the screams of their leaders inside the dothraki overwhelmingly accepting someone who just murdered the shit out of their leaders clearly using some form of magic which they hate as their new ruler none of those things are inconceivable but dany acted with complete assurance that everything would miraculously go in her favor
asoiaf,removed,how on earth did a little girl manage to chop up two men and then take the time to bake them into pies without anyone noticing it just makes zero sense
asoiaf,removed,i genuinely think they only cut this because they wanted people to like sansa i liked sansa more in the books even now i think sansa is an utter fucking bitch in the show with that said i think her character is supposed to be unlikable in the books too but unlike the show the books show her developing as a character and learning things they tell us how she feels sorry for her treatment of arya and how she misses her family the show tried so hard to make her look likable they completely ruined her character in the process since they destroyed the foundations upon which it was built i cant like sansa in the show i just cant
asoiaf,removed,wow you are spectacularly obtuse and belligerent you seem to think your blind assertions are somehow valid but mine arent and that you dont have the burden of proof when making a claim yet i do and you ignore the events that i provide as evidence and then say i didnt provide any evidence if you look around youll see that a majority of people seem to disagree with you so maybe were all just reading a different series than you
asoiaf,removed,and cue the we need twow already comments right about now
asoiaf,removed,but then she goes ahead and hides the fact that she has a giant fucking army from her halfbrother and gets hundreds of men killed i dont think thats the case i think that she had no idea that littlefinger would honour his promise theres nothing worse than a false hope they had to fight with what they had if she promised the knights of the vale to jon and littlefinger decided to turn cloak or keep them out imagine the effect on jons army
asoiaf,removed,ugh ugh ugh here is another one and another one i am going to stop i am one of those who argues this is medieval period and what not but where do people come crawling out of to make these videos i enjoy all sorts of tinfoil theories but are these high schoolers who make these videos i really hope so anything less is highly disturbing
asoiaf,removed,that isnt how spoiler tags work fucknut delete this
asoiaf,removed,your thread title is bad and you should feel bad
asoiaf,removed,have you read the novelization of girls cup
asoiaf,removed,top trolling sir but youve overreached noone who can read is this retarded i advise everyone to stop feeding the troll
asoiaf,removed,not if his penis no longer works which is often the case with paraplegics im tired of these idiotic reddit arguments watch intouchables you crazy fucking cunts too houses i havent even heard of doesnt mean bigger houses can or will do it yes since he inherited patrilineally ned stark shares far less dna in common with his nephew than those two lord starks did only through a misunderstanding again obscure lore does not a plot point make
asoiaf,removed,never heard a nonfeminazi use glass ceiling
asoiaf,removed,im done with this if youre that blind
asoiaf,removed,no she wants myrcella to be queen she is already the future princess by virtue of cognatic primogeniture also dont fucking insult my memory you clearly do not remember much wanker
asoiaf,removed,they should build a wall to keep the humans out and make westeros pay for it the nights king making the north great again
asoiaf,removed,im not commenting on the quality of the dorne scenes im commenting on the fact that you described three female characters as sluts if youre upset by a feminist agenda then stop behaving in a manor that necessitates the agenda in the first place
asoiaf,removed,they made him the donald trump of westoros
asoiaf,removed,no the feminist agenda is whatever martell killing dornan for no reason and badass naked women who kill for no reason also curious how you call heroic women an agenda would you perchance be a sexist the egalitarian theme of the novel is the heroic woman yes not a feminist agenda
asoiaf,removed,ah well there you go
asoiaf,removed,i asked him the other day at my slumber party he said hed probably be done by the end of the night to clarify that was last saturday just waiting on it to be published now
asoiaf,removed,wahh the north didnt remember wahhhh
asoiaf,removed,theres no need to get whingey when im referring you to the very clearly stated spoiler scope policy of this subreddit you read spoilers everything at your own peril if you dont want to read twow pre release spoilers stick to spoilers published spoilers main or spoilers many people on this subreddit use spoilers everything because they want to discuss everything plenty also use spoilers main or spoilers published or spoilers to limit discussion the mods police the spoiler scope well
asoiaf,removed,wahhhhhhhhh why le north didnt remember waaaaaaaah preston jacobs should write the show waaaaaaaaah
asoiaf,removed,the seven elio and linda cuz they ruined it
asoiaf,removed,linda melted the fuck down as much as i thought she was being a horses ass about the whole thing one thing you got to understand is they are the ogs of asoiaf theyve been with grrm since the beginning and have maintained a larplevel fandom since early in the series im not sure they do that anymore but you get the idea of how big of fans they were and why they are where they are with him today shireen being confirmed from george was probably the first huge spoiler from the show and frankly linda did not take it well to get an idea of how ugly it was her twitter rage is the only reason i refuse to buy twoiaf
asoiaf,removed,its not exactly coming up roses in the us good luck with your current events though and on the bright side you dont have to listen to uk donald trump anymore
asoiaf,removed,you are just a butthurt annoying book reader
asoiaf,removed,have you even watched the wire and the sopranos you troll and the show is much better than the overrated lame books get over yourself
asoiaf,removed,you are just full of shit and an annoying snob
asoiaf,removed,shit taste strikes again
asoiaf,removed,people who name their kids after asoiaf characters are by and large idiots an idiot would have trouble spelling daenerys and besides whilst names like brandon and jon dont can be spun off as somewhat normal variations of classical names daenerys is too clearly outlandish
asoiaf,removed,there will be no twow george gave up last year
asoiaf,removed,well im sincerely worried about him dying before finishing the books
asoiaf,removed,they are masters of camoflauge and they use gorilla tactics via poison dart gun against their enemies what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little southerner ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the crannogmen and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on the ironborn and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top dart blower in the entire northern army you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on planetos mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over a crow think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of crannogmen across the neck and your house sigil is being identified right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you with over seven hundred poisons and thats just with my dart blower not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of house reed and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of westeros you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in these swamps youre fucking dead kiddo
asoiaf,removed,it didnt work
asoiaf,removed,im not simply pointing out that anyone whos on this subreddit likely knows this or read my comment likely knows this or looked at the chart likely knows this i appreciate them backing up my point but quoting a section from the books and acting like hes informing me of something i didnt know doesnt always mean hes trying to help
asoiaf,removed,believe it or not there are people in real life there are more good and people that are more evil just having only grey characters would be as unrealistic as just having black and white characters atrocious post btw
asoiaf,removed,wut the overall story was far from over how about getting slowly to danys invasion and exploring the white walkers more instead we get pointless stuff like brienne wandering aimlessly and quentyns useless story lots of padding with no direction unlike the outstanding first three books the ironborn and dorne were never that interesting either tone down your fanboyism mate its not healthy
asoiaf,removed,should we forgive this sarcastic summer child for his comment or downvote the shit out of it
asoiaf,removed,work on beginning then get back to me
asoiaf,removed,firs get off your high horse your question is as medicore and unimaginative or as unique and imaginative as any of the posts the arrogance with which you think your question is somehow more imaginative than the rest is pathetic and quite frankly reeks of joke gone bad
asoiaf,removed,stand proud you did no wrong and if you did who cares we do not kneel
asoiaf,removed,i didnt realize it would be that big of a deal its not this guy is just being kind of a douche ive seen this same thing posted dozens of times and the same dream scene with different dialogue posted many more times well before this specific version came out no one really cares honestly except for people with sticks up their bums
asoiaf,removed,well fuck and i thought i was alone in that i dislikehate arya too welcome to the club buddy i also never got to like daenerys at all idk shes just there for me and has a key role to play and thats it im pretty indiferent towards her and if she dies at some point i wouldnt care at all tbh
asoiaf,removed,and watch how lfs plans perfectly puts him in the throne youre confusing showlittlefinger with booklittlefinger booklittlefinger never mentioned what he wants and he doesnt seem stupid enough to go for the iron throne doesnt mean that her role in the future will keep being roberts babysitter of course not now that she has been found by a bountyhunter shell probably be abducted again though this time maybe it will be to her rules rather than to somebody elses
asoiaf,removed,im not just talking about littlefinger technically i guess its beyond the spoiler scope of this thread but in her twow chapter we find that shes learning a lot about whats happening around the vale from sources other than littlefinger if she hasnt learned that by now she never will none of the other prominent characters have really reached the second half of their arc either arya just finished her training bran is still being trained jon and dany are still learning to rule i dont know why sansa would be any different
asoiaf,removed,i absolutely hated hated hated and loathed season i found season muvh better than season season felt extremely fuckimg fast just jumping from one plot point to another it was extremely fucking fast
asoiaf,removed,the pink letter is real the battle of winterfell will play out similarly to how it does in the show
asoiaf,removed,my nigga
asoiaf,removed,my nigga
asoiaf,removed,i think this is part of why stannis in the show is so different in the books we generally see him through the eyes of davos whereas in the show we see him as he is its obvious that he wants the iron throne but davos cant see it the producers and writers clearly saw stannis as a bit of a villain who is dead set on getting the throne which doesnt gel with the idealised view of stannis we get in davos chapters part of it is also inconsistent writing i think he is the most inconsistently written major character in the show but ive always maintained that at his core stannis in the show is much like book stannis than a lot of people are willing to admit hes not a good man and his efforts to take the throne have more to do with his personal desires and ambitions than with a sense of duty to the realm
asoiaf,removed,im surprised a devout muslim country like that would allow such a show
asoiaf,removed,renly would have made a better king than stannis in acok stannis does come around somewhat later on which isnt to say renly wouldve been perfect or didnt have some major flaws but i think he and the tyrells wouldve been more capable of holding the realm together without it descending into chaos stannis doesnt get how power works thinking hes just owed loyalty without needing to give anything back while renly understands that theres a more delicate balance underneath it when tyrion meets dany he wont be anywhere near the positive influence he was in the show rather the opposite etching her on to bring death and destruction to westeros and embrace her darker urges all so he can laugh at cerseis corpse at the end of the day jaimes redemption is rather superficial and mostly happening in his head he and many readers will have an ugly awakening when he meets lady stoneheart i for once wouldnt even be shocked if he doesnt make it until ados to be honest by extension i also dont think hell kill cersei or save kings landing again or anything like that you cant just turn around and become the hero after all hes done and hell realise that before the end theres a method behind briennes much critized affc chapters shell be hugely important going forward jon and dany ending up lovers before the story is over isnt bad writing it makes perfect sense ned wasnt stupid at all dd are in part deviating so far on purpose so they dont spoil the book plotlines and people will be quite thankful for that in the end
asoiaf,removed,i am descended from spanish nobility
asoiaf,removed,grrm really needs to finish the next book so we have something to talk about
asoiaf,removed,throw enough shit at a wall see what sticks also his attitude gets me too
asoiaf,removed,pretty sure aegon got dropped entirely thats why jorah got griffs greyscale
asoiaf,removed,surely that fat pedophile will croak pretty soon
asoiaf,removed,i cant believe that his first question to george was if quentyn is alive if i met one of my favourite fantasy writers id never ask such stupid thing
asoiaf,removed,he has more money than he can spend and lets be real we dont see many olds in his size he may have years left even with a major weight change unless he has the weirdest genes that gives him terrible metabolism but huge arteries that cant be blocked what most people miss about his health is that its not an eitheror proposition either he doesnt have to die to not be able to finish the books people with bad cardiovascular health dont always just have a heart attack and fall over they usually see rapidly declining health in their later years and hes not going to necessarily feel up to finishing when hes on a rascal scooter and feeling like shit all the time theres also very little you can do to prevent a stroke strokes are a bitch as a man in his thirties with a few too many pounds on his frame the fear of having a stroke in my later life is whats motivating me to diet all it takes is one little blood clotpiece of cholesterol to break off travel up to your brain and shut off blood flow to an entire section then your drooling to yourself while half of your body is numb
asoiaf,removed,no he wouldnt he will have all his notes destroyed on his death he has already stated it there will be no finishing the book series if he dies
asoiaf,removed,im hoping he dies so you are all so butt hurt
asoiaf,removed,well he cant write it anyway if he dies of old age
asoiaf,removed,im sorry but elon musk is an idiot and his announcement about going to mars doesnt really have any validity
asoiaf,removed,you seem hopeful as a summer child as you assume the writer wont die from old fatness hamburglar syndrome im just happy the show will finally have resolution for the the story that we know for a fact will happen
asoiaf,removed,you keep hahahaing but i dont see anything funny in your comments baelish is from the small council duh and joffrey as i said had just proved that he is stupid and unstable by killing ned did you even read my last comment if joffrey is stupid and the council untrustworthy why did they not negotiate with tywin directly instead the made all the terms with baelish im hahaing because you are desperate to be ignorant you know in which other point they could get quickly to the city the city itself the city will not fall quickly so mace was trying to make an entrance for the camera did he know that there was going to be a tv show about it because it was stupid to try to surprise stannis when he was almost upon kl specially since mace didnt know the weather was hit stannis and as far as he knew stannis could be in kl already you are being facetious haha assaulting stannis from the rear forces him to engage you in a weakened position if you arrive to early stannis can simply retreat back to storms end with his host still in tact as far as mace knew stannis could be at kl already mace knew stannis had left storms end and he didnt know the weather was going to slow him down was he planning on attacking stannis once he was safely behind walls as far as mace knew why would he believe that when stannis has to bring his entire fleet up to close of the blackwater it is difficult to siege kings landing because it lies at a mouth of a river it makes it difficult to deploy without opening yourself up from assault at the south he tries to use his fleet to ferry men across so the entire host isnt caught beneath the walls of the city
asoiaf,removed,im desperate to be ignorant where is this knowledge you have that i havent seen have you put a way to prove what you say then you have no way to assure that what you think is what would really happen so you have no objective knowledge and failing to agree with you is not ignorance you are ignoring the book and making what you want to happen up thats wanting to be ignorant they didnt negotiate with tywin directly because he was not available but they did sent for him to back up lfs proposal actually he was available thats how they were able to get word to him so quickly tywin had command of the lands south of the ruby ford and east of the green fork it would have fallen by the time tywin met mace if it hadnt been for weather delaying stannis the weather delaying stannis was caused by melisandres blood magic weakened position havent you been saying over and over again that stannis do not stand a chance against maces are you saying mace would have lost if he had attacked stannis like this stannis would be in the weakened position read closer hed have his back to the tyrells when the initial assault begins that is a weak position that the tyrells can comfortably crush stannis without him being able to retreat his forces in good order enlighten us then how did mace thought stannis was going to attack kl because he was going to attack and everyone knew that as soon as storms end fell the clock started ticking well since stannis is claiming a throne and the only obstacle from his trying to take it is an undefended castle in his rear that he just captured its pretty easy for mace to believe that stannis would attack kings landing
asoiaf,removed,again telling someone they want to be ignorant isnt an attack or being uncivil example me the earth is flat you present evidence that the earth is round me ignores that and continues to insist the world is flat you you want to be ignorant thats not a personal attack its a statement of situation a personal attack would be an insult
asoiaf,removed,well its not like ned was going to correct their thinking that would have shamed howland if were looking at how the show did daynes death i mean if ned told them that wasnt me howland stabbed dayne in the back that would dishonor howland and we are told how ned holds howland in reguard my father knew the worth of howland reed robb in asos
asoiaf,removed,one might say you didnt understand what i posted
asoiaf,removed,too bad ned couldnt handle jaime like vargo hoat did
asoiaf,removed,dont feel bad man women not even they can understand themselves
asoiaf,removed,so im guessing you dont agree with the bombing of nagasaki and hiroshima
asoiaf,removed,george should release chapters as he finishes them like one every months
asoiaf,removed,the only i see you enjoying is making yourself look like a fool on the internet in your grandmas basement lol
asoiaf,removed,apparently he read an aeron chapter
asoiaf,removed,no recording yep
asoiaf,removed,going on this subreddit is like dodging bullet now anyone think we will have the chapter written or maybe a video of grrm reading it soon
asoiaf,removed,was theon supposed to rule and what was the burning castle
asoiaf,removed,margery clinton confirmed
asoiaf,removed,definite trump supporter
asoiaf,removed,randyll tarly votes for donald trump
asoiaf,removed,meanwhile weve got randyll tarly voting trump
asoiaf,removed,mace the ace vs bernie sanders
asoiaf,removed,holy shit read the books
asoiaf,removed,walder trump
asoiaf,removed,the worst part is his unmanly quavering high pitched voice what a fucking sissy
asoiaf,removed,we find out the identity of the guy on the horse who saves bran and meera i wont tell you who it is though its under that spoiler box
asoiaf,removed,honestly what do you even have a clue what youre talking about
asoiaf,removed,what i do see is that presumably the dany storyline does really well with focus groups hence it gets allocated a massive budget for the cgi and animals and locations and all that shit what i dont even know what to say lol this is beyond retarded i mean lets just rewrite the story just because you dont like it lets gift the dragons to sam surely youll love that if you really think george lets plot points be changed because of focus groups lmaooooooo and the speech wasnt unnecessary it drove the point from last week home that she now has the khalasar fully behind her and is finally going for westeros if you dont like it fair enough making dumb excuses to not like it tho lol
asoiaf,removed,dont call something retarded it is demeaning and it shows your immaturity and by extension it shows your ineptitude to conceive of complex things which is also backed by your post your ignorance brings conversation down please stop
asoiaf,removed,the high sparrow knows how to play the game hes like a cross between machiavelli and bernie sanders
asoiaf,removed,this episode was awesome and very well done what would have made it awesome would you like a white walker battle in every episode not enough boobs for you your simple complaint without any elaboration nor constructive ideas shows that your opinions are subpar and underwhelming and they bring down the quality of posts in this sub please stop
asoiaf,removed,randyll terrified me and ive got an entire fourth wall to protect me
asoiaf,removed,for some reason i read that in trumps voice
asoiaf,removed,godsdammit kids stop listening to bernie sanders
asoiaf,removed,could this possibly be one of those examples of pedantry that seems inherent in the asoiaf press response world we were repeatedly told that jon was dead which was true but he was still resurrected it could be the case that in the books benjen is not coldhands because in being reanimates benjen lost aspects of his character and became coldhands this ties in with grrms whole death changes a character model
asoiaf,removed,boo boo boo this person
asoiaf,removed,yea i was just commenting that in the show benjen definitely coldhands but as weve come to see books show
asoiaf,removed,in the original manuscript of adwd georges editor asked if coldhands was benjen and grrm wrote in red no way you totally guessed it the photocopy weve all seen got cut off
asoiaf,removed,to be fair the question he responded to was much longer than that he could have said no to another part been unsure whether they were going to be the same character or changed his mind
asoiaf,removed,while yes more then likely this is the case it doesnt really mean much could just be grrm not really wanting to get into it much
asoiaf,removed,your face is subpar and underwhelming
asoiaf,removed,god i just want fucking pope francis sanders to die so hard that smug smile on his fucking face made me so fucking angry
asoiaf,removed,if they wrote the books i might kill a baby
asoiaf,removed,youre right too old
asoiaf,removed,someone isnt in awe because muhhhh benjen and muuhh fuck off
asoiaf,removed,haha those fucking imgur comments are all fits of autism about the downvote being blue and not red imgurs downvote is red
asoiaf,removed,daenerys make an epic speech targaryan i am going to hurt someone that little whore really thinks she is some hot shit i hope a dothraki bloodrider rapes her and make daryo watch while he butcher her face
asoiaf,removed,thats a really really shitty argument long ago never means a couple of years the roman empire flourished long ago the american revolution occurred long ago barrack obama did not get reelected long ago
asoiaf,removed,so do black people in jail there i said it
asoiaf,removed,were building a wall stocking up on wild fire and the white walkers are going to pay for it
asoiaf,removed,was it ever leaked the actor who plays benjen was on set
asoiaf,removed,what is dead may never die maybe the iron born have it right i can think of outcomes for them when the long night comes both hilarious when they see the army of the dead they either have an existential crisis re their religion or being the retards they are wanna sign up and join the wights
asoiaf,removed,jesus this shows writing is complete shit next level retarded and boring dnd managed to turn a masterpiece into complete shit fucking assholes should be tried for crimes against humanity
asoiaf,removed,yeah whatever last time i posted it it got removed because of the wrong tag what kind of spoiler is shadowstabbing even bloody kneelers

asoiaf,removed,especially given the victims of the high sparrow thus far has only been framed to be women slutshaming to a degree that you even felt sympathy for cersei in the show and a gay man never mind the high septon was the first person they made walk its slutshaming never mind the fact that cercei was the queen regent the most powerful person in the seven kingdoms while people were being burned out of their homes and made to watch as their husbands wives and children were murdered as they watched the fields they tended burn and they starved to the point where they were made to eat their own dead its slutshaming never mind the fact that loras is the heir to the wealthiest family in westeros while people die of starvation its slutshaming
asoiaf,removed,this is such a pointless thread same stupid for being for getting a bit of payback swords just sitting there not killing white walkers there is a shortage of weapons they lost that cache of dragon glass plus dragon glass is fragile and kinda one time use hes going back to the wall and he knows it maybe hell give it to tormund or ed or unbenjen
asoiaf,removed,plot twist your humor is childish
asoiaf,removed,you know if you had valid arguments you wouldnt stress out in such a bro way gonna slap her your stupid problem is totally subjective to be frank i dont know why they even film videos of this they could just have podcast
asoiaf,removed,spoilers everything
asoiaf,removed,unless euron has some biochemical suit similar to the suits folks use to clean up chernobyl and fukishima he is not getting near valyria why do people buy so hard into the rumour that the smoking sea and valyria are still ruled by the doom all we have is hearsay legends and stories euron has a dragon horn a valyrian suit of armour and he used to own a dragon egg why cant he have actually braved the smoking sea sure he is a boastful bragging manipulator but all the material evidence seems to point to him telling the truth where else could he have found these artefacts anyway i agree with the theory that euron has some connection to the and is possibly a greenseer and maybe even a skinchanger his black eye shining with malice has to have some purpose as do the dusky woman and his crew of mutes i believethink that he is able to skinchange into people and he cuts their tongue out so they dont rat him out the idea that his entire goal is to reopen his third eye makes sense to me i hadnt thought of that yet that could also be one of the reasons why he kidnaps all the priests of different faiths that we see in the aeron chapter from yesterday
asoiaf,removed,theres something funky going on with your formatting in the op try deleting extra spaces at the beginning of the first three paragraphs
asoiaf,removed,that whole youtube teen culture of debating something with filming yourself is so as redundant as dd screenwriting
asoiaf,removed,dont make comments about harming real people here even in the spirit of hyperbole
asoiaf,removed,fuck context she is a racist scandinavians logically are my advice next time post few arguments why review is good in the title then more people will maybe watch it and not downvote it into oblivion i wanted to do it but you were fasterd
asoiaf,removed,how did i instantly see that the whole purpose of your post is to hate on them linda actually watches the show and it is quite clear your whole comment makes zero sense i would have thought people here are smarter about judging people instantly considering that is one of the major themes in asoiaf apparently not though
asoiaf,removed,that woman isnt worth marrying hopefully your friend gets rid of such a vapid bitch the pure entitlement and inability to be an adult is staggering
asoiaf,removed,shitpost mcchamp over here
asoiaf,removed,melania trump
asoiaf,removed,jon dayne im sure of it
asoiaf,removed,i havent seen season until this june all because i knew that some things would be spoiled after the middle of the season like the campaign of stannis towards winterfell but i wasnt able to refrain myself after reading in a site what was happening in the season at this point the tv show plot has diverged in such a way that there is no point in not spoiling yourself let me give you an example lets say that in season daenerys dies this will happen in the books too for the most part but it will be completely different she will have other persons around her she may even die by having different last words spoken the characters are now completely different characters so every step they make makes a completely new experience for the show viewer and the book reader the books have so many details for example no victarion that are absent from the show at this point that there is not a reason for you to hold on i went and saw season this summer after it had aired i propose that you do the same
asoiaf,removed,the show and the books have nothing to do at this point of time we are talking about different characters even when we are looking at the main storylines grrmartin has said himself that a lot of the characters that die in the show also die in the books but another large part dont die and another even part dies but in completely different circumstances that lead to other events you are not spoiling yourself by watching the show imagine that someone comes to you and tells you that bran fights the night king and defeats him on a daenerys dragon do you honestly believe that this will have anything to do with the storyline at the books in the books bran will have used valyrian armor and a valyrian dragonhorn i am saying random words while in the show he will just use telekinesis or obsiddian there is nothing to unite the show with the books at this point we are past the point where u see something and you say come on that cant be true in the books this is completely different make yourself a favor and watch the show it is a fun side story that will get u hypedbut when the books come and victarion faces euron then you will enjoy something that cannot be spoiled by the show
asoiaf,removed,he sent someone else to buy them hes the vales donald trump and that man does not go buy his own lemons
asoiaf,removed,smelly joy smelly lips idiot
asoiaf,removed,mods please delete this bastards account not attacking him just calling him by his name
asoiaf,removed,there arent a ton of other people it could be there you go folks nailed on reddit shit posting logic at its finest coupled with some predictable i knew it lying text book i didnt say everyone was surprised i said it was the general sentiment learn to parse son lsh has been named on imdb in the past the fuck out of here son
asoiaf,removed,dude how did you season already tell me does the wall come down at the end of season
asoiaf,removed,someone gets hammered for not knowing about please report civility violations and unwelcoming behavior so we can address it if necessary
asoiaf,removed,a big battle sequence is unlike got what the fuck are you smoking
asoiaf,removed,its kinda like if donald trump became president and was flown into syria and parachuted out guns ablazing at isis and other radical terrorists not a fan of the guy but i sure as hell would be rooting for him to kick some ass
asoiaf,removed,have you not read the books shitter
asoiaf,removed,dont give up your day job
asoiaf,removed,fans generally spout utter shite and even when they do come up with something good it doesnt have any respect for other story lines or flow and continuity in other words youre talking melodramatic shite
asoiaf,removed,yeah if they said they had the vale everybody would have joined them out of fear if not out of loyalty
asoiaf,removed,bullshit jon is guaranteed to win in episode so whats the point of not making good television out of the journey towards that victory by not having the lords back jon now theyre setting themselves up for a nonsensical situation of why jon wouldnt just wipe them all out and burn them all for when the white walkers arrive
asoiaf,removed,yeah shes now why havent we seen her tits
asoiaf,removed,let us get some facts straight we are all overanalyzing sansa she does not know fuck just like know nothing snow jon snow had good instincts sansa does not have those either to her credit she has started put stark in winterfell campaign for whatever reason she might just offer her cunt to littlefinger and achieve it that will be her legacy
asoiaf,removed,holy shit the autism either stark name is important and you need that for legitimacy in the north or stark name is not important and who cares about the starks they are not important yes its literally not possible that ramsay a young and clearly foolish fellow doesnt magically know that some of the northern lords dont care about the starks anymore
asoiaf,removed,s rickon is killed and flayed and displayed on a cross smalljon and tormund get into a battle tormund kills him jons side is winning kind of like the battle of redgrass field ramsay has archers indiscriminately fire into the battle lots of ramsay supporters die but ramsay has more men and can take the attrition the bodies pile up so high that jons men use them as fortifications but are basically stopped it looks like ramsay is going to hold his position essentially winning when the knights of the vale show up and break his forces jon kills ramsay
asoiaf,removed,high traffic yes but it has not gotten ugly so far overall post quality is great and i havent seen any serious fights your secret mod strategies for setting a nice tone are working hopefully you are not holding you blankies much this season i did wonder if the bot has been given an upgrade or new siblings because things are going smoothly
asoiaf,removed,wow now that is an impressive find this subreddit is infinitely better than the drivel posted on the game of thrones one the only counterpoint i would add is that this is from season im not entirely sure george rr martin would divulge that information to dd that early but who knows
asoiaf,removed,fuck you
asoiaf,removed,fuck off
asoiaf,removed,michael patrick alex cusack management posted in november that their client was currently filming got but didnt mention the character robert fawsitt dermot ward and aron hegarty on november the castannettenow agency posted that their three clients were are all shooting in game of thrones season that week and the next their roles are unconfirmed matt faris universal artists agency tweeted that faris was cast back in september but his role is unknown ramsay does not die
asoiaf,removed,this post has been removed per the subreddits no meme policy
asoiaf,removed,bruh does this thread have to exist every episode
asoiaf,removed,i think gregor vs hound will happen next season not this this season something unexpected iwll happen
asoiaf,removed,no no we dont if we believe his theory to be dumb and unfounded then we are allowed and i think encouraged to speak our mind about it this is reddit not little league theres no fucking participation awards we dont need to hold each others hand to utzoey your theory is dumb and therefore so are you there is nothing about margaery slipping olenna a picture of a rose their houses sigil that would suggest poison what it eludes to is margaery is still working for house tyrell shes signaling her grandmother thats shes manipulating both tommen and the sparrow as per their conversations in early seasons the last thing margaery would want is for tommen to die if he dies she is no longer the queen but queen regent like cersei is now while is a very prestigious title and will probably live comfortably she would have no power over the realm nor would her family her objectives has been to rule as queen not to live a pampered life as a short term ruler who didnt get a chance
asoiaf,removed,ohhhhhhh i so badly wish i knew what was said
asoiaf,removed,looks like this youre a racist bastard
asoiaf,removed,looks like this youre a racist bastard
asoiaf,removed,thats exactly what is going to happen so get over it or skip the episode
asoiaf,removed,ur da
asoiaf,removed,my guess for episode rlj flashback confirming jons parentagejon goes into the winterfell crypt and discovers it for himself euron arrives in essos dany deals with him and takes him ships begins sailing for westeros cersei unleashes the wildfire killing high sparrow margaery several faith militant and maybe olenna if she isnt out in time brienne leads jaime to lady stoneheart lady stoneheart kills the freys sansa littlefinger moment in winterfell she either kills him or admits to trusting him again ramsay is fed to the dogs andor ghost preferably the latter white walkers arrive at the wall and break through castle black
asoiaf,removed,i hope theres even more boobs in these episodes last one made me so happy
asoiaf,removed,sorry hey maybe he survives an arrow to the knee or something
asoiaf,removed,rofl at some point you have to take responsibility for yourself when your standard for spoilers is that fucking low and get off the sub
asoiaf,removed,she is denied a trial olenna is allowed to leave margaery continues manipulating tommen all this forces her over the edge she unleashes the mountain on the sparrows and lets him kill as many of them as he can he isnt able to get to the sparrow but in the madness tommen is killedpresumed to be killed by cersei she realizes there is nothing left for her in kings landing and while the mountain holds off the sparrows she unleashes the fire she manages to escape it but it wrecks the red keep and kills several people including margaery the high sparrow the mountain lorasolenna if they are still there several faith militia and forces an injured tommen to jump out of a window to safety rather than jumping to safety he falls to his death leaving cersei as the one to have killed her final child

asoiaf,removed,the cleganebowl just got ten feet higher
asoiaf,removed,you just said you zero idea what will happen in storylines then state correctly that the title will have something to do with the white walkers and wall gee i wonder what might happen to that wall maybe theyll help reinforce it for the nights watch
asoiaf,removed,not any more annoying than someone bitching about people having some fun on a damn website
asoiaf,removed,um everything this guy just said is leaked info about this season just warning you
asoiaf,removed,lol suggesting plot movement has been slow this season its been the complete opposite or are you being wilfully obtuse
asoiaf,removed,the victarion chapter when he faces off with ser talbert serry and the shield islands i think its called the reaver its a personal favorite of mine
asoiaf,removed,donald trump is the current republican front runner people are stupid thats how

asoiaf,removed,are you serious the show hasnt established that at all but has shown him to be skilled at small scale ops and a pretty formidable fighter your statements are pure hyperbole at best people up voting this drivel just shows how detached from reality many people are in this sub
asoiaf,removed,being a midget isnt acting
asoiaf,removed,stick to rgameofthrones then you baby
asoiaf,removed,yeah you like that you fucking retard
asoiaf,removed,this is a soup temperature level desperation post george plz
asoiaf,removed,high quality shitpost
asoiaf,removed,my name is pate like the pig boy
asoiaf,removed,so what happens to the others the nights king was the lord commander of the watch the wall went up after the long night and brandon the breaker defeated nights king there is no nights king in the books only night king it doesnt make any logical sense drop it already
asoiaf,removed,wow so much head canon here first off the troops and their effectiveness will vary depending on where they are what theyre doing and who is leading them a dornish spearwall is far more effective in battle than the ill equipped rabble youll find in other armies we have no idea who rode against the knights in meeras story could have easily been ned or brandon you presenting that as fact is just plain silly i dont care how dreamy you think rhaegar was none of it changes that you dont know shit about when she was taken or if she went willingly and ive already explained that it wouldnt matter even if she did we only ever hear about rhaegar through those who loved him or hated him but even if all the best stories about him are the true ones he was still hopelessly foolish started a war ignored the sufferings of his realm and died in the mud because of it
asoiaf,removed,you sure showed me mneckbeard
asoiaf,removed,that would have msde one hell of a sitcom three and half men
asoiaf,removed,really you want pence inappropriate anyway
asoiaf,removed,still has a whole month left to kill him off
asoiaf,removed,ok presidentelect youre not fooling anyone we know its you
asoiaf,removed,yeah yeah i dont give a shit anymore
asoiaf,removed,not surprised this post has no comments ill bite twow is rigged thats right folks you heard it here first twow would be on the shelves right now if it were not for the work of one bastard and million illegal wildlings i started a petition for a page count please if anyone cares about the future of westeros they will sign it also winter is just a hoax created by the meeranese in an attempt to scare westerosi into the slave trade peace out
asoiaf,removed,that sad at the end sounds like it came from a donald trump tweet
asoiaf,removed,or not
asoiaf,removed,all
asoiaf,removed,why the fuck is he so lazy
asoiaf,removed,then then and final then not needed
asoiaf,removed,knowing nothing she wont be the only one
asoiaf,removed,i cant think of one damn reason dd would want to spite george op is an idiot if he thinks dd have something against the man who let them make this show
asoiaf,removed,upcoming books oh my sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,when donald trump becomes the next president
asoiaf,removed,im not saying hes going to be just like the show he could simply be a powerful weapon of the others they can reanimate the dead and he can control the living thats a huge advantage for them dont project onto me your dislike for others opinions
asoiaf,removed,the brother that ate his own fucking boots too keep that cunt safe during the siege of storms end the brother that has been nothing but loyal his family and then he killed him please stop sucking stannis cock the onetrueking meme is dead
asoiaf,removed,save your breath facts dont matter to people who concern themselves with this nonsense
asoiaf,removed,hes not trying to argue with you you seem like a dick tbh
asoiaf,removed,omg ive never heard of this theory before
asoiaf,removed,how is being excited about a theory i have never heard before being rude
asoiaf,removed,their fathers were azor ahai who stabbed their mothers with their penises who were nissa nissas which ended up killing them therefore they are all lightbringers
asoiaf,removed,but also brexit and potentially president donald trump
asoiaf,removed,at least this is a good point uahabsfirstname is too much of a dumbass to know what the difference between a heretic and a heathen is i agree with the defend the faith thing
asoiaf,removed,god youre a smug one
asoiaf,removed,i so hope grrm enters this but at the same i dont because i want twow this isnt an entry so dont vote for me i do love this idea though and i wish other fandoms did this
asoiaf,removed,fixed
asoiaf,removed,poor guy maybe if he stopped writing blog posts about how bad donald trump is he could concentrate on finishing this god damn book
asoiaf,removed,tits at
asoiaf,removed,make the great ranging great again
asoiaf,removed,i never liked dany i dont know why we are supposed to like her shes really boring and im sick of the i am danaerys mother of dragons conqueror etc etc especially on the show like in season where she jumps on drogon to tell her followers to follow her i cant wait to see if she improves this next season but the leaks show that she may actually improve they only need to fix her dialogue stop making it so cringey
asoiaf,removed,the americans rectify and orphan black are awful looool dumbest shit i have heard today i guess you arent a fan of indepth characterization consistent character development good writing and fantastic directing
asoiaf,removed,well from what i have experienced fans and a good deal of reviewers have said best season yet
asoiaf,removed,i think we can have a discussion on what we think is quality without you needing to try be peace making go away
asoiaf,removed,i would call you delusional but i respect your opinion
asoiaf,removed,hi the spoiler scope for this thread is spoilers extended which does not allow discussion about leaks please add production spoiler tags to your comment and i will approve it example of spoiler code usage s your spoilers here please make sure the quotes are regular quotes and not fancy quotes
asoiaf,removed,yeah dumb and dumber must be so sad to be sitting in their huge pile of money and all those emmy awards
asoiaf,removed,i shaved my mutton chops because i didnt want people to think i was some super game of thrones fag
asoiaf,removed,robin would finish before dany even got her clothes off
asoiaf,removed,thats right gaztelugatxe for example is less than an hour away from bilbao one of the largest urban areas of spain with almost a million people living in its metropolitan area and a well known tourist destination for people living there or visiting shooting there is nothing like shooting at the castle of zafra tower of joy thats in the middle of nowhere and a privately owned site not to mention that we get a full list of areas where theyre planning to shoot months before shooting even commences some of which are even strongly advertised both online and by the local authorities
asoiaf,removed,because weirdos go out to the sets and take pictures
asoiaf,removed,im worried about this bullshit too i remember after the season finale there was an article in the google feed that said spoiler alert major death in season finale and there was a picture of the character dead on the ground right next to it i had already seen the episode but jesus fuck these spoiler terrorists need to knock it off
asoiaf,removed,okay thats a little bit extreme lol but its true upto a certain extent before reading the books i thought the show was the best thing to happen and book fans were salty after reading the books knowing how detailed the storylines are is when i started seeing flaws in the show it doesnt help that and most parts of were bad no more politics in kings landing anymore compared to the first seasons it feels theyve dumbed down the show as it became more popular
asoiaf,removed,unsubscribe from the subreddit
asoiaf,removed,you know last year i stayed the fuck away from spoilers and the show only surprised me twice with the hodor reveal and with how pathetic the arya plotline was so this year ive decided since the show cant produce any twists apart from characters who everyone forgot about dying i might as well treat myself to some spoilers
asoiaf,removed,sucks though that we are getting confirmation of a monumental meeting of two characters through spoiler leaks instead of the show or book
asoiaf,removed,hbo and nathalie emmanuel are in on it just like kit was in on it last year
asoiaf,removed,that dude in the front looks a little like pod
asoiaf,removed,i tried looking up the linda go kill yourself antonnson meme to no avail whats it from
asoiaf,removed,tower of joy leaks the guy climbed mountains and finally got a good spot to film the entire location while they filmed the fight the leaker was whispering get em beanie and it kinda became a thing in this subreddit
asoiaf,removed,because you touch yourself
asoiaf,removed,faggot
asoiaf,removed,avoiding twow chapters read the aeron chapter dude its amazing the mercy chapter was essentially spoiled in the show so you can read that as well
asoiaf,removed,while it is quite salty its well known that linda is basically a terrible person grrm probably uses her as a muse for cersei
asoiaf,removed,hodor
asoiaf,removed,have you seen your peers if a girl has drunk sex you loonies call it rape i am not mysgonistic or a bigot so try again sexism means that you have a opinion on how a sex should act so that means youre a sexist as well so sexism isnt inheritantly bad misogyny is a real problen in certain parts of the world and certain cultures but not among the western countries and cultures of course women can be heroes one of my favorite books from the bible is the book of esther i wish i had her courage and faith sansa is a great main character in her own right her povs are always intresting and ger perpsective on things always intrested me a pov chapter of margery would be nice but i doubt we would get it olenna us pretty funny and she deserves a poc so we can get more of her sass i know it is exaggerated but that was kind of the point as her lines have seen to have gotten a bit ridiculous sometimes as i said i dont care what gender the lead is as long as they are good which is policy for almost anything dont care what they are as long as they are a good hard worker or produce high quailty products
asoiaf,removed,i dont think its technically foreshadowing but i saw a post somewhere that mentioned a scene im going off of memory here this is when bran wargs to the past and sees hodor as wyllis and actually talking bran i saw you you were talking what happened to you hodor hodor now that we know why hodor is hodor that scene means a lot more hodor happened to himhold the door hodor with the same word he always said he fully answered brans question but we didnt know it at the time
asoiaf,removed,lmao yes take that grrm youre fat and well never let you forget it
asoiaf,removed,i think one of the alleged plot leaks says they find an island of wights in the north and the dragons attack from the air but the ice king down a nondrogon dragon which is later reanimated as an undead ice dragon so maybe one of the dragons clutches up a wight with its large talons
asoiaf,removed,a bit of both imo i definitely hope its fake
asoiaf,removed,one of the leaks said that dany is at eastwatch when this happens so the island of wights isnt that far also the three heads of the dragon thing is more important in the books than the show and im confident that most of the stuff that happens this season wont happen in the books
asoiaf,removed,theres a leak of the whole season floating around and so far its gotten a lot of scenes right even before filming began in the leak it states that jon and others go north of the wall to get a wight for proof in the south the nights king is there and shit goes down but dany arrives in time to save the group however viserion gets killed and reanimated by the nights king
asoiaf,removed,well there dont have to be three dragons just three dragons that could be three targs three people who have the heart of a dragon etc
asoiaf,removed,he was killed north of the wall and if you remember last season benjen says they were attacked by white walkers so we know theyre the cause of his death also sam remarks on his preserved condition indicating something unusual about his corpse and in the books its noticed that his eyes were blue when hes brought back through the wall
asoiaf,removed,actually they were already wights merely pretending to be dead once they were carried inside they awoke after everyone fell asleep at that and went directly for lord commander that was a very intricate assassination attempt by white walkers
asoiaf,removed,search your feelings you know it to be true
asoiaf,removed,it works better for the screen if the guy who is telling everyone it is real is the ones going out there to show all these other people whats up he would seem like a coward if he didnt plus he doesnt seem to care much about being kitn he is used to getting he hands dirty thats what he knows it would not be very jon to send other people to die because they havent encountered the undead before
asoiaf,removed,i dont know how im getting downvoted and you upvoted for this it doesnt matter if he told lyanna what to name him because he died before aegon was dead meaning there is no chance he would have told lyanna to name him the same thing as his still living son further he likely assumed it was a girl and thought she would be named visenya and then still with both of rhaegars other children dead and rhaegar as well it would make no sense to assume a prophecy was coming true in the way he thought by the children born to him lastly people just dont name two children the same thing of the time
asoiaf,removed,i seriously only clicked on this thread to say daemon blackfyre hell make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,it doesnt really have to be months on end he is kitn he has boats a boat from white harbor to dragonstone isnt that long of a trip a boat to eastwatch by the bay isnt that long they arent going to need to travel by land as much anymore
asoiaf,removed,i think ugroke was refering to the two wildling corpses jon brings back to cb after he led a group north of the wall to have new recruits swear their vows at the weirwood where sam and he did the same in agot this happens in jon viichapter
asoiaf,removed,i was okay with most things with the leak except for the jd thing im still clinging to hope that the nephew and aunt wouldnt go down that way
asoiaf,removed,i think grrm meant it in another context perhaps he meant trump ahs the baratheon personality but the twisted joffrey version of it
asoiaf,removed,can you give me a link to this leak please
asoiaf,removed,if someone sent you the link can you send me the link pm
asoiaf,removed,can you pm me the link
asoiaf,removed,i agree for the most past but the boat sex part seems to drive a lot of people mad
asoiaf,removed,what leak link
asoiaf,removed,if you still want it ill pm you
asoiaf,removed,actually that sounds like a great season the dragon pit scene in contrast is stupid and makes everyone other than cersei look like huge morons especially jon who is trying to outdo his uncle at being a naive bumpkin and im assuming that a certain boat scene that is cheesy as hell is also confirmed
asoiaf,removed,pm please
asoiaf,removed,would really like a link as well if you dont mind
asoiaf,removed,its the whole season be warned may i have it as well please
asoiaf,removed,so it seems like those spoilers were legit and it looks like dany will be riding the direwolf i wonder if either will know of his parentage at that point obviously for dany it would be normal and probably a turn on the great rhaegars son but what would really interesting would be jon being ok with it in a twisted way i could see it hes been an outsider his whole life and to find out who he really is could change him
asoiaf,removed,could you pm me too
asoiaf,removed,riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,can someone pm me the leak
asoiaf,removed,isnt trumps parallel euron greyjoy came out of nowhere and claimed the seastone chair like donald claimed the republican nomination also from out of nowhere drowned sawane botley like donald drowned jeb bush defeated both the more moderate asha greyjoy and the traditional ironbornvaluesholding victarion greyjoy in the kingsmoot similar to how donald defeated the moderate marco rubio and traditional conservativevaluesholding ted cruz establishment damphair trying to stop him after its too late similar to the republican party establishments attempts to derail donald after it was too late mysterious connections to magic and warlocks just as donald has seemingly magically captivated the attention of the electorate and even has his own wizard connection david duke cynically taken advantage of the ironborn culture of jingoism bravado and racism and turned it on its head to drive his own secret interests similar to trump selfdescribed highenergy winner that crews a ship of mutes silent majority and is rich from plundering far away kingdoms may have molested someone has weirdlooking lips
asoiaf,removed,give me link pls
asoiaf,removed,trumps parallel is robert baratheon
asoiaf,removed,could you add me on the list for the link as well
asoiaf,removed,tldr
asoiaf,removed,could you rewrite that entire thing to include thread title in english so we can understand it
asoiaf,removed,lol best selling doesnt equate to quality get up off of sks pansy waisted knob bro
asoiaf,removed,should i report posts that one cant understand drunken posting is upsetting me
asoiaf,removed,the man has a life too he could do whatever a ordinary person does in life if hes campaigning to hillary its because its a good cause in his view hes concerned about his country and thats absolutely nothing wrong with that
asoiaf,removed,god damn it george i mean the gall of the man i want you back chained to that brick of a computer where you belong
asoiaf,removed,implying trump isnt going to win a term wew
asoiaf,removed,no it didnt you insufferable nerds
asoiaf,removed,in breaks immersion what are the odds of danys eggs hatching an extinct species while also not burning to death also its funny how you wrote this post you doth protest too much imo youre a show fan and youre doing a form of whats known as concern trolling ie trying to bash the books and argue that theyre just as badly written as the show you can give yourself added credence by your protest that youre a dedicated bookonly reader mhm sure
asoiaf,removed,thingvellir national park was the site of a lot of filming including that gorge thats the approach to the eyrie its close to reykjavik you can also do game of thrones tours from reykjavik there were a number of filming sites in northern iceland and tours that will take you to sites like jon and ygrittes cave but those wouldnt be day trips from reykjavik on a sadder note i believe they arent filming there until january
asoiaf,removed,i would recommend heading to the lake myvatn area in northern iceland it can be visited as a daytrip from the town of akureyri which is around drive from reykjavik which is where a lot of season was filmed including the scenes where jon hooks up with ygritte in the caves besides got the area is home to several dramatic landscapes including bubbling mud pools the blue lagoon of the north toxic so you cant swim in in it smoking vents and the water falls godafoss and dettifoss latter is the most powerful waterfall in europe there probably wont be much snow in september though
asoiaf,removed,no it doesnt thats just your opinion you shouldnt state your opinion as fact it makes you seem sort of like a weakling
asoiaf,removed,jon couldnt get the northern lords to help him to fight ramsay bolton are these untrustworthy pussies able to be expected to fight an almostinvincible zombie army led by fucking magic ice people whether they can be trusted is completely and utterly irrelevant theyre the only real chance he has because tv show theyre loyal now alright clearly theres no reasonable discussion to be had here
asoiaf,removed,get some lotion for that thumb though
asoiaf,removed,thats a horrible misreading of trump
asoiaf,removed,that brandon part may actually be referencing arya and how she wants to see whats west of westeros aryas tomb will probably end up empty as well
asoiaf,removed,looks are everyones defining characteristic did you post this same thing on every other comment because literally all the comments are discussing looks you and your upvoters are pc stooges incredibly sad and dishonest
asoiaf,removed,showbloodraven described plugging into weirwoodnet as going under the sea
asoiaf,removed,can you provide a link to the download
asoiaf,removed,daario euron confirmed
asoiaf,removed,i can only find one reference in the books to candles and that one is an obvious joke so let me know if i missed other references that came in this conversation between cersei and taena a feast for crows cersei iv the queen did not fail to note the style that taena used when referring to tommens little wife tell her ive sent seven beeswax candles to the baelors sept in memory of our dear high septon taena laughed if so she will send sevenandseventy candles of her own so as not to be outmourned i will be very cross if she does not the queen said smiling to me that does not suggest anyone ever actually used candles or seriously was expected to but rather is a play on word seven to express how margaery will try to exaggerate and out do cersei at seeming religious
asoiaf,removed,or joncon and aegon
asoiaf,removed,linda is a dick though and i agree with you
asoiaf,removed,vs is not one of the ways to abbreviate versus
asoiaf,removed,haha i nearly included aka faggot in the response
asoiaf,removed,gendry would like a word
asoiaf,removed,wait why is the brotherhood heading north anyone got a link how i miss this i remember the hound joining them but thats it
asoiaf,removed,it was definetly heavly implied but then we got the blue rose on the wall in acok and gendry was introduced the show is obviously going for danyjon its the simpler couple and its going to be a fan favorite not in this sub but generally however i am not sure which direction the book will take grrm its not worried to make weird love relationship that people dont really like daario and dany for example the show has a problem with that for example they made daario far more likeable as a character what im trying to say is that aryajon may happen and we cant trust the show in this kind of things
asoiaf,removed,from books pov he wont seem as important for the baratheon line even in the show his character was merged with edric and then went rowing for quite sometime but how the show has continued to give him more importance with him coming back next season with all war hammer and all does make me feel he has a larger role to play and grrm has also said he and arya going to meet again so he has more role in the books as well dd know the end they could have easily chosen to go for edric in the start of the show but went for gendry maybe down the line he stands as more important
asoiaf,removed,i believe you mean whose unless you think that i am a hollow rubber tube that water travels through
asoiaf,removed,if ramsay and his could men can cuck stannis entire army then dont underestimate what half a dozen guys can do when it comes to dd
asoiaf,removed,you need to change your tampon i think you are going into a toxic shock induced rage remember it is me you are angry with has made several valid points you have countered with belligerent opinion with evidence based on unrelated facts the year gap changed many aspects of the plot for examples based in reality the meerenese knot was not originally covered as deeply in the story asshai was dropped as a location the more time grr has to write the story the more it will change
asoiaf,removed,arya will look like an a northern beauty she will be year younger than dany when she married drogo the same age as catalyn when she was to marry brandon as far as the north is cincerned arya stark is already married and is lady of winterfell george said arya seems older than most year olds in his books he said said if a year old has to conquer the world then so be it what is your point what a ridiculous thing to say about a character you clearly no nothing about varys recites a speech about the kind of ruler westeros needs line for line arya ticks all the boxes arya stark queendom leadership jon questions if arya was ever his sister is she still my sister he wondered was she ever jon a storm of swords arya thinks jon wont be able to call her little sister anymore jon wonders what arya looks like now arya worries jon will not recognise her anymore because she has changed so much when they meet again they will be so different yet they have so much in common it will be like a new beginning lol for politics arya stark has already claimed winterfell unlike sansa arya has not been disinherited and is the only stark maiden jon raised an northern army in aryas name and they march on winterfell to rescue neds little girl for personal preference because his bond with arya is the strongest because he gave her a sword when ladies arent meant to have them one day arya will give him arms when bastards are never honored she would strengthen his stark legitimacy besides if a girl cant fight why should she have a coat of arms jon shrugged girls get the arms but not the swords bastards get the swords but not the arms i did not make the rules little sister arya a game of thrones but he did gie her a sword because the memory of her smile warmed him all the way to the wall because needle is jon snows smile as arya thought with tears in her eyes because jon brie his vows and died for her his last thought was of something he told her at their last farewell because to jon aryas home isnt winterfell her home is with him
asoiaf,removed,seems like itd be a fitting end for sansa to either kill him or be directly responsible for his death
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,why euron do you think euron is the westerosi version of trump
asoiaf,removed,yes the news of a trump victory probably gave grrm a massive coronary
asoiaf,removed,gallows humor isnt for everyone really though he seemed pretty passionate about this election based off of his blog so i expect it might effect the speed of his writing i also imagine a trumpesque character is going to get a remarkably brutal death in twow or ados although i cant think of which character that might be off the top of my head
asoiaf,removed,what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
asoiaf,removed,why peace best kill all the southern people and make north great again no more people no more problems in the future
asoiaf,removed,tywin lannister would have made westeros great again if only he was on the presidential ticket
asoiaf,removed,he may create a character modeled after trump just so he can find a creative way to kill him in a book so if anything it could prolong the book wait unless he adds the character to ados
asoiaf,removed,hell get over it like all the other drama queens
asoiaf,removed,if he seriously gets butthurt over this and uses this as an excuse to delay the book further then i will lose any remaining modicum of respect i have for him he chose to support the most corrupt criminal candidate ever to run on the basis that donald said some mean things and that we should vote for clinton just cuz she has a vagina grrms got egg on his face today at this point i dont really care if he finishes any of his books since hbo will give us the ending anyway he should spend more time writing the book instead of trying to get crooked clinton elected
asoiaf,removed,look trump robert baratheon clinton cersea lannister you can get as butthurt as you want about it but you know its true and anyone upset about her loss didnt read the leaks he is a loud mouth idiot thats a brash womanizer he fought his way to the throne even killing the princejeb he has no fucking clue what he is doing and will probably leave us in more debt because he cant settle for just a turny but they have to be great he has the best turnies she has been biding her time setting all the chess pieces in their place in the background legally or illegally she has been playing the game of thrones most of her life and sticks by her pig of a husband but its her turn now and no one will stop her well except herself dont forget about her own scandals coming back to haunt herhigh sparrowincest stuff and i have a feeling cersei will will pull a hillary next season and be the cause of her own demise
asoiaf,removed,indeed as i said below the one thing that doesnt track is intelligence euron despite being completely deranged has it in spades trump is a moron who can barely string a coherent sentence together
asoiaf,removed,i wonder if trump is a got fan obama asked d and d for early copies
asoiaf,removed,george pisses me off im sorry to be so blunt but hes suicidal and depressed and wont write winds of winter now give me a break grrm write the damn book and stop your whining
asoiaf,removed,is making a joke about trump grabbing the bad poussey too highbrow for this conversation
asoiaf,removed,i have never been more of a grrm fan winter is coming a long cold unbearable winter presidentelect tr i cant even write or say the name i just cant lets stick with pussygrabber i am ashamed today i know that the democratic candidate wasnt anyones favorite but there was no contest in my mind therefore i am ashamed that not enough rational people turned out to prevent this country from giving in to fear hate misogyny and xenophobia make american great was such an obvious metaphor for make america white that ill bet many of the red hat wearers made that mistake hen speaking i am ashamed for my race and gender and im sorry this is an apology as well as a rant it started as a joke a joke perhaps when the mourning is done then the humor may returnbut it doesnt feel very funny right now not funny at all
asoiaf,removed,just tell his dragons youll make valyria great again
asoiaf,removed,could anybody possibly link me the script pls in a pm thanks
asoiaf,removed,so fucking pathetic so people who discuss proust or russian classic writers are intellectual but the ones who discuss martins writing are nerds remember martins writings is not fucking dd writing
asoiaf,removed,i read them trump wins
asoiaf,removed,i am quite aware i left it as i dont believe in censorship remove it if it offends your pc selfrighteous desire my next offense will begin shortly fuck you
asoiaf,removed,so deep and rare
asoiaf,removed,i dont feel even remotely bad he shouldnt be on rasoiaf if he is worried about spoilers thats the dumbest shit ive ever heard
asoiaf,removed,that op is full of shit
asoiaf,removed,avoid the sub or at least put the right spoiler tahs on your post
asoiaf,removed,if you want to interact with the rest of society you need to stop using words like cuck
asoiaf,removed,oooooooh i get it im getting downvoted because of hillary
asoiaf,removed,i think you were right initially about the politics thing that guy who commented and the people who downvoted are probably butthurt from the elections or something its sad how pathetic people can be
asoiaf,removed,a i really dont get why youre being downvoted b whats everyones issue with the word cuck its a word it was used properly and youre getting upset seems more than a bit ridiculous
asoiaf,removed,are you a faulty ai that was civil you ignoramus
asoiaf,removed,yeah but its about her mother mostly look around its quite easy to find
asoiaf,removed,you stupid haters should just leave
asoiaf,removed,sword was lodged in a head heads dont float but whatever you can be right if youre so mad
asoiaf,removed,mary sue point check plot armour point check all you need now is to add another sentence or two about lazy writing false contract speculations dd bashing and your comment could become a masterpiece of a futile argument
asoiaf,removed,strange ive read through the series twice and dont recall seeing a faegon anywhere
asoiaf,removed,id be very surprised if maisie williams has read the books shes every bit a stereotypical millenial
asoiaf,removed,as it is he might die before ados is published presumably he has taken steps to ensure that we get closure on it even if that happens though i was thinking maybe i would write a fan fiction about travelling farther to the east
asoiaf,removed,lolololol wow she sounds like a real intellectual
asoiaf,removed,hey mate can you pm me that link
asoiaf,removed,the fine bros are two guys who if they were characters in fiction the writer would be accused of having created antisemitic caricatures vines are short videos by and for mouthbreathers
asoiaf,removed,i remember when i was this unjustifiably arrogant in high school
asoiaf,removed,found the adolescent who thinks literature analysis is about becoming part of a characters fan club but that applies to pretty much all of the stannis worshippers ive seen
asoiaf,removed,and trump has what relation to this exactly
asoiaf,removed,the princess and the queen normie
asoiaf,removed,last i checked trump wasnt a house in a song of ice and fire
asoiaf,removed,maisie williams is not a poster in the thread if youre going to broaden the civility policy to refer to discussion of people who arent actually members here youre going to have a rough time brainiac
asoiaf,removed,you were just rude to me dont be rude to me im reporting you to yourself
asoiaf,removed,i think that sounds fucking stupid
asoiaf,removed,ramsey kills rickon in ep
asoiaf,removed,looks like the cotf do create the white walkers

asoiaf,removed,long post of possible spoilers ahead you have been warned his original post hey first post in case some of you think this is bs go through my history and you will see i posted some accurate true detective spoilers a while back stop reading if you dont wanna learn what happens keep in mind i havent read the books so im not too sure of the siginificance of some of this stuff or if it is already known dont wanna give away to much right away but here are some spoilers for this season sansa will go to castle black and meet up with jon they will reminisce and sansa will apologize for treating him badly sansa will also have a quick meetup with baelish jon and sansa will eventually team up to try and get their brother back they have the wildlings on their side and then travel around and try to recruit more people the whitewalkers were created by the children of the forest you will soon learn how hodor came to be the whitewalkers attack bran and company and hodor will be forced to hold the door as they make their escape uncle benjen will come to rescue bran and meera he will accompany them to the wall before departing bran will have one more flashback in the finale and we will see whats in the tower who else is still alive the hound he is saved by some followers of some sort they all get killed by some former brotherhood without banners members while he is away the hound meets up with the other brotherhood without banners and gets revenge davos will find the little toy or whatever he gave to shireen he will confront melisandre and she will admit to having her burned euron gets chosen to be the new king because of his plan to marry dany and enter into an alliance with her to take kings landing yara and theon steal their ships instead and plan to enter into an alliance with dany instead jaime is forced to go to riverrun and retake the castle from the blackfish for the freys brienne also goes to riverrun to try and get the tullys to join up and retake winterfell brienne fails but escapes edmure is forced by jaime to enter riverrun and give it up since he is the rightful owner the blackfish apparently dies in battle but we never actually see it happen samwells father doesnt approve of gilly samwell decides he doesnt care and leaves but not before stealing his fathers valyrian sword arya will be asked to kill some actress she refuses and the waif is given permission to kill arya dorne will not be shown again until the finale questions asked and his responses so youre saying aryas going to die no only one stark dies this season not including flashbacks rickon yes do we get cleganebowl how about bastardsnow bowl what happens in the tower of joy no trial by combat is denied so the mountain doesnt do much this season he does get to have his way with septa unella though yes we see lyanna stark what is the relevance of lyanna stark in the tower though we already knew she was there confirmation of rl j or do we not learn anything lyanna whispers something to ned before she dies we then see a baby and the very next scene we see jon interesting last questions for me i think any details you can provide on how the children of the forest created the white walkers i dont remember exactly as the scene was brief bran has a vision of a bunch of the cotf gathering and doing something he wakes and then confronts leaf about creating the whitewalkers she says they did it to protect something bran then has a vision of the whitewalkers but the nights king actually senses him and thats how the whitewalkers learn of brans location and attack thats all you see from them this season what happens during the bastard bowl does jon retake winterfell do we meet howland reed to confirm what happens in toj also do we hear what lyanna says to ned jon almost kills ramsay yes no no almost jon chooses to imprison ramsay rather than kill him oh forfucksake jon i imagine the whole nothern conspiracy thing doesnt happen then if rickon gets killed and the umbers are loyal to the boltons also i hate to be a bother but are you kind of just scratching the surface with spoilers or are these spoilers more or less the big events that happen this season had to google northern conspiracy not sure if its a conspiracy but jon does become king of the north this is after the teen girl who is head of some house with like soldiers speaks up about how she trusts the starks and was one of the only ones to follow them into battle then the other houses speak up and apologize about not following them and they dont care that he is a bastard ah sorry for not explaining basically the conspiracy is the idea that the umbers gave the bolton rickon to get their trust and then side with jon in the war depleting ramsays forces btw im pretty sure the girl your talking about is the head of house mormont btw does sansa legitimize jon as a stark ok then theres no conspiracy mightve be house mormont the recruiting scene is pretty funny as jon sansa and davos make these great speeches on why she should join them only to find out she has less than men dont think sansa legitimizes jon but she is agreement that he should be king ah fuck yer house mormont is piss poor bear island has no resources so that makes a lot of sense so if their is no conspiracy does ramsay just kill rickon or does he survive and then get killed in ironic way i believe you said he died by arrows so i assume he might get killed accidently in the battle ramsay and jon meet across the battlefield ramsay releases rickon and tells him to run toward his brother as rickon runs ramsay starts shooting arrows up in the air one at a time that keep missing him jon starts galloping toward rickon but just as he reaches him one of ramsays arrow hits him and he dies in jons arms sansa is the smart one she tells jon before the battle that rickon is already dead thats hilarious and sad at the same time osha is already dead by this point and apparently one the flayed men placed on the battlefield by ramsay is someone of importance dunno if their is any truth to that yes osha should be dead in the next episode or maybe the one after she and ramsay are talking she tries to seduce him and grab a knife that is lying nearby ramsay reveals that theon told him everything and then kills her thats fucking depressing any torture occurs against rickon or osha in the mean time up until their respective deaths and does the smalljon die smalljon is the guy who gives rickon to ramsay osha dies in her very next scene dont think we actually see rickon get tortured he has very little screen time and not sure about smalljon does tyrion interact with the dragons do they come to trust him are there any other major deaths this season i hope tommen is one no only dany dragons dont really interact with tyrion and yes lots of major characters die mostly in the finale dont wanna spoil all of them but tommen does die osha dies pretty soon but shes not a major character also we can assume the dies when the whitewalkers attack but really all that matters is that wun wun lives how does tommen die he jumps out the window can you prove all of your spoilers by providing something that happens in episode read the first bullet point about jon and sansa can go into more detail sansa ends up meeting baelish at the town outside winterfell brienne goes with her baelish apologizes for allowing her to marry ramsay sansa accuses baelish of knowing about ramsay and basically says she doesnt want anything to do with him any more i actually believed you a little but how can sansa and lf meet in the next episode when lf is in the vale judging by preview and sansa is going to castle black hmm maybe im remembering incorrectly and that meeting happens in episode pretty sure its in the next episode either way what does definitely happen in the next episode is jorah and daario see dany and are about to save her she tells them she doesnt need to be saved and instead has them help lock her in a tent with the other khals
asoiaf,removed,yes i am only asking for spoilers in text form not any pirated video or whatnot if anyone could pm a link to where this supposed spoiler has posted text that would be appreciated
asoiaf,removed,can you pm me a link to the text so that i can test my willpower
asoiaf,removed,httpsnpredditcomrdirectimagelinkerbotwikireslinks httpsnpredditcomrdirectimagelinkerbotwikiindex httpsgithubcomtheonefosterdirectimagelinkerbotblobmasterdirectimagelinkerbotpy
asoiaf,removed,right now im just trying not to look whole post that spoils the whole season i was sooo close to looking at it
asoiaf,removed,hey get the fuck out of here they leaked the whole season i love you dont look back i regret looking at it so bad

asoiaf,removed,care to link that
asoiaf,removed,mine is a cheap gay joke
asoiaf,removed,mine is a cheap gay joke
asoiaf,removed,according to the guy who leaked a lot of info this season that has been proven true yeah it is benjen

asoiaf,removed,trailer link
asoiaf,removed,elio and lindaaaaaaa are on suicide watch
asoiaf,removed,yep im officially on board the fuck bran train now choo choo
asoiaf,removed,because its obviously fucking canon why else would they not include an important backstory in the show why are you so surprised the cotf started the race and they were hardwired to kill men and they got out of hand you can babble on about theories but theories arent the show or books
asoiaf,removed,can someone inbox me a link or site for the ep pls
asoiaf,removed,really how
asoiaf,removed,not looking at comments but if anyon can reply to this comment with a link to the episode i will love you forever

asoiaf,removed,managed to get a link from my firestickholy shit that was intense people are going to lose their shit cant believe what i just watched defo one of the best episodes ever all we need now is cleganebowl
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,hold the door
asoiaf,removed,i see the photo was posted so heres a httpiimgurcomhevueyegifv
asoiaf,removed,ive seen the so ill just not comment bc i would probably spoil something
asoiaf,removed,how did u watch it torrent
asoiaf,removed,which trailer
asoiaf,removed,the door doesnt hold
asoiaf,removed,when did this become shitpostfocused show subreddit
asoiaf,removed,get your tissues
asoiaf,removed,spiteful nerdism feeling superior online like a lot of people on reddit social awkwardness that like so many other people has developed into a backhanded passive aggressiveness
asoiaf,removed,ive always wondered what kind of moron would like the dd plotline thanks for answering that question
asoiaf,removed,the ultimate question stay up to and watch the show and read the comments on here or get it watched right now tough one
asoiaf,removed,euron wins at the kingsmoot and orders all out attack on westeros asha and theon victarion brandon shakes hands with his namesake
asoiaf,removed,for anyone whos watched early just answer me this is it worth watching right now
asoiaf,removed,wow you outed yourself as not having thought this through there friendo how the fuck would hodor go madaerys go madany one of the things you mentioned happen if bran is the one to do it in the first place that means if he hadnt done it he wouldnt be there in the first place and those things would never have happened so who made him go back in time in the first place to cause that to happen you are thinking small minded this is a story were that doesnt work you need primer levels of time travel theory in order to make a story as rich and detailed as asoiaf work or else it just seems stupid and if this was a story that went into that much detail about time travel to make it logically plausible it would eventually be so far removed from what we love about asoiaf im glad you can accept it and watch it without thinking about it though
asoiaf,removed,hahaha you take issue with my post only to say that the writers failed to provide realist internalist struggles conflict progression etc yeah so you definitely didnt read the books sold to drogo lives with khalasar witnessess sacking of villages drogo sickdying mirri mazzi dur so far getting the dragon eggs and her eggs hatching are the only things that are remotely deus ex machina she takes her remaining people and as a female exoticforeign leader with only baby dragons she does the only thing she really can go from place to place to amass favor and alliances eventually leading to the unsullied etc so yeah i think youre talking out of your ass or you dont know what conflict character progression and internal struggle even mean as for assuming that you just dislike her based on her gender it actually was the only thing that made somewhat sense i could see someone overlooking the content of her story for that reason but now i dont know what to make of it ps you at least seemed to understand that my reply was meant to be a little insulting try using those reading skills next time you read a dany chapter
asoiaf,removed,where did you see that spoiler
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,for those interested a little bird told me that the episode is already leaked on the internet
asoiaf,removed,i think maybe bran might go too far and not listen to bloodravens advice putting him im the situation maybe he gives thier position away maybe nk will stop him from going back to his body that would be pretty cool bran stuck in this state just watching the nk attack the wall or something i really dont know which is why im pretty hyped
asoiaf,removed,i cried in public
asoiaf,removed,yeah i watched the leaked episode before i saw any spoilers just so i could stay ahead of them lol
asoiaf,removed,no its much more mundane wont spoil it for you though
asoiaf,removed,hodor
asoiaf,removed,so much hype for tarthmund pegging
asoiaf,removed,hodor
asoiaf,removed,lol all of the pissed off showfags downvoting you
asoiaf,removed,shout out for this thread happy to admit i was wrong about my reasons for putting this theory down earlier on guess i didnt bank on it being this scifyish
asoiaf,removed,if i had seen this episode already id say that the ending was almost exactly as i imagined it and far more moving than i thought theyd be able to pull off
asoiaf,removed,because it doesnt spoil a thing i dont see the problem with it
asoiaf,removed,not gonna lie the door is a great title for this episode
asoiaf,removed,youll find out soon enough
asoiaf,removed,yes and i hope to see a lot more of her for research purposes of course
asoiaf,removed,you will fly cry
asoiaf,removed,it proved that arya actions on s story in the last two episodes seasons to be super stupid and retarded
asoiaf,removed,littlefinger comes in and saves the day also rickon dies unbelievable
asoiaf,removed,well we cant all have shit taste
asoiaf,removed,report it and let the mods decide ops fate for the mods are just yet forgiving
asoiaf,removed,i remember thinking while watching it this is actually a spectacular bit of zombie film and that was without wun wun the valyrian steel trump card and that amazing ending where the nk raises all of the wildlings
asoiaf,removed,the show is the only reason ive paid for tv of any kind in my entire years as an adult i pirated the first seasons but had cable hooked up and paid for hbo for and hbo now for
asoiaf,removed,bran cant see into the futurethe wildfire going off is a giant miss lead and everyone is drinking the koolaide

asoiaf,removed,s ramseys arrows thinning out the herd
asoiaf,removed,if that flavor is poop
asoiaf,removed,i also think jon will not have a happy ending i think he will meet his end before the series wraps up in some sort of heroic way or in a sad depressing way that shows the laws of nature and how realistic life is and stories like this hold no happy ending jon will have to become the new night king once he kills the night king to forever lead the others away from the wall towards the lands of always winter jon becomes the new night king tryion becomes king and rules i have always seen dany as somewhat antagonistic with her views and mindsets at times she gives hints of her mad father the hatred and stubborn stupidity she has she walks the earth like she owns it only because people have told her she used to own it she has no characteristics of royailty besides her hair and what people have told her slowly over the course of seasons she has taken peoples submission as weakness and formed her own regime fueled of what people have told her is rightfully hers she has no experience in ruling politically she is useless she cant even maintain peace and order in meeren and qarth which had order before she showed up even if slaves at least there wasnt revolts every minutes false religious gods preaching propoganda with freedom dany brought along many enemeies that didnt have a platform to voice their opinions after ser baristan died it is apparent their military has dropped her voice of reason jorah gone daario is a blood hungry idiot that only things with his cock or blade grey worm is a fearless commander who obeys anyhting even to his death if tryion wasnt there to cause common sense she would lose it all i see her fueling her own greed much like cersei but in a positive way it will be more shocking for dany then the rest of westeroos when she realizes she cant control her dragons and they are too dangerous and need to be put down a mother can only control her children for so long its about time drogon goes to college nigga once her dragons are dead i dont see a reason for anyone to support her cause as ruler besides the tit hungry jorah and daario greyjoys now because they depend on her
asoiaf,removed,fuck that bitch having valid reasons for awful deeds does not justify them hitler had his reasons too and protecting a country is a better reason than protecting a child
asoiaf,removed,well im talking about politics in general besides politics in kl involve the entire realm but keep latching on to semantics
asoiaf,removed,youre a troll
asoiaf,removed,knowing morebeing deeper in the story than other people doesnt give you the right to be a prick
asoiaf,removed,enough with this shipping business it ruins good tv shows
asoiaf,removed,prepare to lose marge mace the ace and possibly loras in one fell swoop its gonna hurt like hell and tommen kills himself bc he cant cope
asoiaf,removed,op its my opinion that beric is better you scoffs condescendingly you won this one
asoiaf,removed,you know what i wont argue with you you angry i can understand that you are waiting for now five years i can understand that but we both know that youll suck grrms dick again when twow will release the guy is working hard to release the perfect story for you if he actually didnt care about you the saga would be over by know we would have a twow and a ados rushed and filled with a lot of plot holes
asoiaf,removed,maybe you are boring and simple
asoiaf,removed,im glad i wasnt the only one to think of this shitpost
asoiaf,removed,i hope he dies fuck it
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,if you are getting triggered over a book series publication schedule debate i suggest you consult a therapist
asoiaf,removed,it must be such a trial to live with all that certainty the rest of us have to take the details as they come but you no you see it all from merest glimpse
asoiaf,removed,yes great for you other people want the books to be finished and acting like that bothers you to this degree does nothing but make you seem like an asshole if youre not interested in discussions on the state of the books just read tinfoil theories otherwise people will have their discussions with or without your insipid approval of their tone
asoiaf,removed,well you should read my theory about the night king then you will hate it
asoiaf,removed,oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,yes this subreddit will get very sticky
asoiaf,removed,i just want to know i got the right thing yes kotsk is actually three novellas combined into a single volume they follow the adventures of ser duncan dunk the tall and his thensquire aegon v targaryen aegon the unlikely theyre excellent reads and have a much more compact lesssprawling feel than the main series they are prequels in the sense that they take place in the same universe before the main series they are not prequels in the sense that the plot of the books leads directly and continuously into got and its successors that said there are a few neat and morethannoteworthy connections also unless my memory has utterly failed me the bn clerk was dead wrong dreamsongs is a collection of martins shorterearlier works which afaik do not take place in the world of asoiaf he might as well have given you a copy of the hobbit also are there other prequel books or sidestory kinda books in the series my mom specifically mentioned one about sir arthur dayne and some other book about dunk and some other weird name i cant remember as far as i know all of asoiaf exists in the main series kotsk the earlyreleased sample chapters from twow and a world of ice and fire which is really more of a reference than it is an actual narrative but interesting and worthwhile all the same if theres a book about ser arthur i havent heard of it
asoiaf,removed,the amount of collective cum on this sub will be monstrous

asoiaf,removed,i think we all pretty much agree that drogon and rhaegal are going to be mounted by dany and jon respectively so the issue lies in who is mounting vyserion now to develope my theory i will need to use spoilers from the next season and i dont want to spoiler tag my entire comment so please dont continue reading if you dont want to hear rumours about the next season not confirmed so i think vyserion will be mounted by tyrion and ive decided about this very recently i heard that the show is going to kill a dragon and make a zombie dragon i think this may happen in the books but first we are gonna get our three heads of the dragon as they are shoved in our face since the series begun why is the show not giving us the third head of the dragon because this wouldnt work on the show they didnt make the proper set up for tyrion riding a dragon it would come out of nowhere and it would be kind of ridiculous but this doesnt apply to the books tyron is fascinated with dragons and we get constant mention of that tyrion dreamed of having a dragon vyserion the dragon that we are not sure about who is riding it is white and gold gold lannister it fits there is also this chapter with tyrion sees vyserion in the air and finds a scale or something like this the saddle he uses for his horse the high probability that he is a targaryens and even if he is not there is still a lot of foreshadowing that sadly i dont have at hand about tyrion riding a dragon all this without mentioning that tyrion dany and jon all killed their mother when they were born which considering they are probably the main characters is a pretty big deal aside from that i was just thinking of a theory about how dany tyrion and jon can be the steps of the forging of light bringer in the azhor ahai legend dany being stormborn would be the tempering in water tyrion would be born from the death of a dragon but i cant quite make jon birth workout with nissa nissa because all of them killed their mother and i dont know why jon would be special finally the things i said about why the show is killing vyserion would also work if bran is warging the dragon wouldnt work in television i dont like this theory but it may happen you will fly i am thinking that maybe after the three heads are revealed the others may kill a dragon and bran will warg him
asoiaf,removed,there is only one deadline if you know what i mean
asoiaf,removed,some women are not capable of making good decisions at all look at hrc or her fake counterpart cersei
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,cersei is gonna be pretty busy boning euron
asoiaf,removed,any particularly good fanfics you can recommend ive thought about it but it is so hard to sift through the fifty shades of garbage and find something that is wellwritten and enjoyable
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,any good fanfic recomendations
asoiaf,removed,uh nope a storm of swords davos iv the last was in the kings hand this one he studied a moment as it writhed between his fingers the usurper he said at last robb stark and he threw it on the flames so yeah no sorry bout that
asoiaf,removed,my thoughts exactly euron is already potentially the mirror image of brans story basically what happens to a child with magical potential when he is raised by people with a culture like the ironborn instead of being raised by an honorable man like ned stark although eurons adult self probably doesnt care too much about the ironborn culture as a whole now his younger self would see what he is doing as heroic eurons story is about pushing the limits of magic sacrifice and morality because he was told since his youth that everything and everyone is his for the taking brans story is about finding new purpose now that he is unable to become the one thing he always wanted to be a knight hes coming to learn that maybe being the crippled boy that saves the world whom no one will sing songs about is more important than being a famouslegendary hero bran has been the most important character in my mind since his last adwd chapter that truly shows how special and rare being a greenseer is i also think people take the teachings of the three abominations of a skin changer theories too far these are teachings of the wildling culture and how they view the morality of skin changing within that culture bran is learning the art of greenseeing and skin changing from the original source the cotf and the last greenseer im sure what the wildlings would consider an abomination would be seen as essential for survival to the cotf
asoiaf,removed,long run what about the next conflict if he gains to pretend like stannis never considered it that he did not struggle with the decision is to ignore large chunks of the book
asoiaf,removed,lets make westeros great again presumably by banning wildlings from crossing the wall and grabbing random women by the cunny when youre king they just let you do it presumably because they are afraid of execution stannis low energy believe me also when mance rayder sends wildlings across the wall hes not sending people like you and me theyre giants theyre cannibals theyr rapists and sure some of them i assume are good people
asoiaf,removed,my favorite show divergent was arya being tywins cupbearer instead of roose bolton at harrenhall they were both amazing storys that had similiar ending
asoiaf,removed,riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,happy birthday finish the goddamn book
asoiaf,removed,listen d w m i said she also speculates that nights king can be from other families you have no logical thinking skills and seriously you are s whaever anyone else might have told you you cannot claim i said brandon becausebut hey the important thing is he is a stark besides grrm has already stated the nights king was just a feicking legend and has nothing to do with night king or the white walkers your entire tin foil theory is based on inferences that are inaccurate this forum is where real fans come and discuss ideas i am increasingly seeing people who come here post something idio and then act like d jerks when you challenge them
asoiaf,removed,cant lay of the death jokes for one day
asoiaf,removed,i know he doesnt like people saying this but damn he is cutting it close he is average life expectancy in the us is httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcountriesbylifeexpectancy but he is also significantly overweight from what i can tell his bmi is likely around and tall which calls on average for a reduction of life expectancy of which says theres just years until the highpoint of the bellcurve a glance at his httpsenwikipediaorgwikiasongoficeandfirepublishinghistory says the average per book is at least years disregarding twow and agot as we dont know how long these tookwill take if he isnt able to finish with a dream of spring its not gonna happen
asoiaf,removed,what is dead may never write
asoiaf,removed,lmao stop watching go away
asoiaf,removed,huh westeros is not america bye
asoiaf,removed,soooo getting closer to not finishing the books before
asoiaf,removed,dany does too in acok
asoiaf,removed,doesnt danys chapter where ole girl points out shes pregnant end with her saying it was her fourteenth nameday
asoiaf,removed,jesus that doesnt make me feel good about the likelihood of him finishing the series
asoiaf,removed,what was the trump joke martin whispered to emelia
asoiaf,removed,at this rate hes going to contract alzheimers and forget what he was going to write before he finishes the last book
asoiaf,removed,ice has been around for quite a while ice is about years old at the time of roberts rebellion and reign given the doom of valyria was around about that time id guess it was one of the last valyrian steel swords forged and passed on to a nonvalyrian household as to how the households of westeros that had them obtained their valyrian steel weapons id imagine valyrian steel was much cheaper and far more common before the doom theres even mention of a suit of valyrian steel armour in one of the winds of winter preview chapters so that makes it a relatively common substance prior to the doom and therefore either traded to sold to or given to households in westeros for whatever reason
asoiaf,removed,one year closer to dying with the books unfinished
asoiaf,removed,happy birthday you mean thank god he hasnt died yet we require more
asoiaf,removed,please dont use racial slurs here even if you dont intend any offense if you edit your comment we can reapprove
asoiaf,removed,hes going to pull a robert jordan
asoiaf,removed,wait hes that old oh man thats not good news that age on top of being quite obese we may never see the great grrm finish the series thats so sad
asoiaf,removed,dont die you fat mother fucker dont you fucking die on us i will rip your screaming fat soul from hell if i have to
asoiaf,removed,maybe did ramsey have siege weapons with him though and would he even need to use them i figured his army just butchered the iron men and simply burnt winterfell still leaves the walls and towers that were made of stone but it would be inhospitable and therefore unable to be used by another invading force
asoiaf,removed,i hope parris gives him a blowie happy bday grrm
asoiaf,removed,more thoroughly margaerys hymen
asoiaf,removed,fuck this guy
asoiaf,removed,already and with long books yet to publish i really hope he lives long enough
asoiaf,removed,if he still had the writing quality that he did when storm came out i could buy two just think of how many things happen in that book but i do not believe that is the case any longer and there is too much that needs to happen i will be very unhappy if only the north suffers from the others given that it was the machinations of the south that caused all this turmoil i mean imagine if ned stark was alive and well and had stayed in winterfell all the north would be gearing up to fight the others likely getting a writ from whoever ruled in kings landing to mine obsidian from dragonstone ned stark issuing a call to all the true knights and heroes of the realm to defend men the ironborn would sit rotting on their islands a whole different book series instead we have chaos being caused by varys littlefinger cersei and cat the tyrells boosted the lannisters onto the throne caused the loss of oberyn mace was going to vote against tyrion just cuz so pissed off dorne all over again if not for the tyrells youd have stannis on the throne lining up with ned to fight the others lol i want the others on the dornish border before they are defeated that needs books at least
asoiaf,removed,brienne makes a comment i cant remember where about not being able to tell the age of children as she was very tall for her age so although edric is he is the height brienne was at its subtle but i like it tyrion has the opposite problem and thats one of the reasons why there is doubt as to the age of young griff tyrion says he is or near enough to make no difference well if he is truly aegon he should be or we are supposed to assume that tyrion just got the age wrong or he could be accurate with this for once and therefore aegon becomes faegon
asoiaf,removed,dead starks
asoiaf,removed,show is getting objectively worse writing quality dipping too many characters being killed for mild shock value in ways which dont advance the plot show popularity also means fanbase quality dipping commoners and women who think being too stupid and lazy to read books makes them somehow superior in years show will end vultures will leave for next fad but us true fads will still dream of spring
asoiaf,removed,i dont think you know how people work cersei can be wrong about things and cersei can be right about things same as everyone else youre trying to make this a black and white choice between yes shes right about everything and no shes wrong about everything people rarely fall into those extremes why is it stretching textual reality donald trump is incompetent yet hes still very close to becoming president being on top doesnt mean you cant be a moron mace was already the most powerful lord in the realm if he had stayed out he wouldve been the most powerful lord in the realm too due to most of the other kingdoms wrecking each other as olenna points out hes making dumb mistakes and doesnt know what hes getting himself into ned as hand of the king isnt exactly someone you want to be comparing mace to make him look good and tywin was pretty darn stupid at various points marge is still being tried and i meant loras is burned and perhaps slowly dying overreaching isnt exactly a smart move tywins dynasty for example wouldve been better off if he had married cersei to lancel and had stayed away from making her queen the war of kings isnt over yet though actually marge was born in ac same year as robb look it up and if you want to be anal about it even then mace couldve betrothed loras willas garlan to rhaenys instead then
asoiaf,removed,some smallfolk are fine but women ruin everything grrm is a masterful writer of female characters because every single one of the women in his books are some mixture of sociopathic narcissistic petty and just plain dumb just like real life you gotta hand it to the guy he knows how life works and writes so well that even the feminists accept that he says the truth
asoiaf,removed,is not was
asoiaf,removed,why is this down voted
asoiaf,removed,from what i saw the comics havent even reached the bookin a site where i read comics it ends in the death of drogoso are there more comicbooks published
asoiaf,removed,you look like a romulan torpedo
asoiaf,removed,take a reality check you mods are massively overinflating your importance here there comes a time when if people hear about something for the first time its not a spoiler rather than a case of being one of todays as xkcd put it its been how long since the last book was published how many years now
asoiaf,removed,hodor
asoiaf,removed,looks pretty cool actually a crown on top of a lion and the fleur de lis the old – frommthe holy roman empire is just a mess
asoiaf,removed,youre missing the entire point and acting like an ass its a disease it can be created via magic it can have magical elements but it still ought to be something and have some element that isnt just magic otherwise the story is just arbitrary fiat it would be spectacularly lazy to just say its made of magic like that explains anything
asoiaf,removed,according to preston jacobs grrm has confirmed no lsh in the show
asoiaf,removed,i think lsh and jamie are top contenders lsh might be completely cut from the show her major purposes in the book imo were to show how resurrection changes one covered with bedric and rally the bwb to enact vengeance on the frays which could easily be farmed off on someone else jamie is unlikely to be the iff he and bri meet in the broken man there are plenty of other potential big reunions for broken man so it could still well be jamie in well know more after sunday obviously my prediction for is lsh if bri and jamie meet in broken man and jamie if they do not
asoiaf,removed,jaime came to mind seeing as they seem to be on opposing sides of the same battle but i suspect theyll meet sooner than episode ten that only leaves brienne catelynturnedstoneheart
asoiaf,removed,a briennepod hanging death cliffhanger would be a hell of a way to end the season
asoiaf,removed,its not a link you just hold the mouse over it and the text appears
asoiaf,removed,by all accounts the blue balls end with
asoiaf,removed,the nigga gendry if hes still isnt singing row row row your boat
asoiaf,removed,absolutely as long as youre not one of the people who thinks twoscene show euron isnt as evil as book euron in the forsaken dropped
asoiaf,removed,most cool names for fiction across most mediums are not original fyi plenty will be outright latingreeknorsewhatever and even more will be tweaks on those theyre usually named this way for a reason relating to a theme in the story in the case of deus ex i believe the cybernetic augmentations that the game revolves around is its god out of the machine taken in a different dramatic context go back and look at all the crap you enjoy look at the name and think why is it called that do a little google search and watch as learning becomes fun
asoiaf,removed,refer to the spoilers megathread they answer your question
asoiaf,removed,no i found it from this the accusation in question im calling it blame because its reasonable to read that context onto the very first statements you made in this exchange the three statements are not the very first i made in this exchange none of them even make it in among the first of my effective statements theyre not at the start of any post i made theyre in fact the very last three statements in the very last sentence of the very last paragraph at the bottom of one of my posts not precisely what id call the very first its reasonable to read that context onto your carryon is reasonable at this juncture its not reasonable to randomly decide words assert something they just dont mean or say then accuse the speaker of having said these things they neither said nor implied when its been pointed out to you that words do not mean this random thing they never said its unreasonable to do any of the following continue to act as though the random meaning you picked was asserted by the speaker even though their words do not assert that meaning blame anyone else including the speaker for it refuse to take responsibility for having caused it and you blamed the female when its been pointed out to you that words do not mean this random thing they never said its unreasonable to continue to act as though the random meaning you picked was asserted by the speaker even though their words do not assert that meaning really i dont think im reaching here you are picking random things words do not say and then attributing that meaning to them on the grounds that the words dont precisely assert a contrary statement to that meaning youve randomly chosen i dont think the word reaching quite covers something of this magnitude your next comments are yet more strawmanning people debate using main points and supporting details thats quite literally how you form persuasive arguments it doesnt matter if youre not a computer here you pretend that i have made some kind of argument about people not using main points and supporting details when debating despite the fact that ive never made any argument even remotely resembling that my actual argument was directly responding to the bunch of bs you asserted about human to human communication with respect to precision standards such as being so concise as to explicitly exclude any and every meaning other than the one the words happen to actually assert the argument i actually made is that this is not how humans with clinically unimpaired communication faculties communicate with other humans thats how a coder conveys instructions to an unreasoning machine theyre programing instead of responding to this argument though youve resorted yet again to just making up an argument yourself and pretending thats what i argued now i admit i was wrong about the main argument i presented which was the only point in contention until you realized you were wrong about it and immediately resorted to making up crap and attributing it to me in an attempt to manufacture the impression that other points of contention you were right and i was wrong about existed this is what i see you made a claim i contested and ultimately i provided information that settled that one and only point actually in contention between us theres absolutely nothing more to argue at that juncture the very first thing you do immediately at this point of being proven wrong was make up something i never argued or implied and accuse me of asserting it while using it as a pretext to lash out at me you got proven wrong and immediately you got nasty making up crap and pretending id said it as a pretext for throwing an indignant hissy fit at me that entire post was an attempt to manufacture an impression that there was more than the already settled point in contention in dispute the admission that you were wrong about the only point in contention eventually appears toward the end of that post not as a point in itself mind you but as a topic transition type sentence opener it constitutes less than half the sentence it appears in in the entire post you gave it a scarce little measly words and even then the primary purpose of those words is to serve your deceitful primary goal of manufacturing an impression of other points being in contention the matter was settled the scope for reasonable disagreement closed when you no longer disagreed about dornish inheritance applying to the iron throne and what followed was an immediate initiation of crudely disguised unreasonable antagonism on your part that does not make the rest of everything ive said anything less than coming from a solid base of reason more stawmanning pretending that ive argued that the rest of everything youve said is anything less than coming from a solid base of reason when in addition to not saying that its contrary to my repeated assertions about the number of points that were in contention prior to that one single point of contention being settled in the beginning there was one point of contention then that was settled then were none and since then nearly everything youve said is unreasonable seasoned aggressive hostility and deliberate attempts to escalate
asoiaf,removed,its almost like you cant fathom an ounce of logic shieldhall was closed because theyre arent many noble people in the nw anymore the tradition to send brothers to the wall had died out much before benjen decided to take the black why would any noblemen considering going to a place as filthy freezing cold and full of uncouth men and criminals when he could forge a maesters chain in oldtown achieving the same results as the nw
asoiaf,removed,truede leaks
asoiaf,removed,hes pleased with it blackfish is gonna get killed off screen just like leaks predicted isnt he

asoiaf,removed,also as a targaryen who doesnt yet know it jon could be described as a sleeping dragon
asoiaf,removed,sweet sweet summer child there is no happy ending here
asoiaf,removed,george was so disappointed with himself last year i shudder to think what his views are this year maybe his next blog post will be a suicide note theres only so much shame one man can handle
asoiaf,removed,for starters we already knew the hound was alive and there is still a chance that stannis might beat the boltons everyone already knew of speculated about lyanna and whilst hodor was sad we already knew that bran could change the past it could still surprise us
asoiaf,removed,lyanna wasnt a big reveal because everyone knew it was coming anyway
asoiaf,removed,battle of winterfell will be massively different though i really hope stannis stays in it
asoiaf,removed,dang shes cute as heck himnot so much lol but good for him
asoiaf,removed,yeah i keep saying this but twow could literally end just how ended dany sets sail jon is king cersei is queen
asoiaf,removed,the post from last week when grrm denied an attendance at a con in july next year made me finally think we will never see it i dont know i am a hobby writer and obviously my stories arent as huge as asoiaf but at this point i lost all my trust to martin he could have planned an entire year what to do and then write a page every second day and would have done a reasonable sized book by now i for myself dont know how to bring the pieces together he overwhelmed himself with the burden of the story he should have done a cut a long time ago currently he needs to resurrect jon battle of winterfell let daeneryss solve mereen and establish her in westeros shit with bran let the white walker destroy the wall bring all the major characters together or tie their character arcs togethersansa arya rickon completly out of business aegon dornish masterplan cersei trial jaime vs brienne i didnt read all sample chapters but as far as i know the only plot driven forward in them is the battle for winterfell how shall he solve this in circa pages i honestly dont know

asoiaf,removed,projecting on strangers on the internet instead of fictional characters does not make you seem less crazy but more so you should talk to your doctor to reevaluate your medication
asoiaf,removed,got hbo is so poorly written it gives me nausea shit makes no sense i hope dd die
asoiaf,removed,that might make me drink a nice cool cup of bleach
asoiaf,removed,your questions do not apply to jorah and dany they apply to some scenario in your mind that you project onto jorah and dany the answers would be no but that does not make jorah or me responsible for your issues
asoiaf,removed,i already did no you are holding two contradictory opinions at the same time it is a fact women and children were down in that castle so your but not all of them mean absolutely jack so basically your argument boils down to this men killed women and children but it was common practice back then so its okay and since a liege lords is doing somethings all the people who have no power over him should suffer the consequences lovely now i know with whom i share no moral common ground and it does make me curious exactly what evil you think tywin ever done as you said so yourself tywin actually has done a lot of evil acts because everything tywin has ever done can be excused by your own absurd logic
asoiaf,removed,were supposed to apply our opinions to the characters dont recall asking for yours

asoiaf,removed,dude you cant come in here with this shit after op spent all that time on an actual post with sources hes reaching its almost certain who the fuck are you theres no evidence that brandon and ashara fell in love because that would be pointless for the purpose of the red herring the idea is to keep it somewhat ambiguous so people think that it was ned and then theyre free to speculate on jons parentage
asoiaf,removed,wow what a measured unbiased response
asoiaf,removed,did you attend the womens march
asoiaf,removed,why do you hate men specifically white men
asoiaf,removed,i am talking about actual evidence from the books you resorted to calling catelyn a jealous possessive idiot
asoiaf,removed,what are you even rambling about are we on the same page
asoiaf,removed,you see we are already way past the realm of factual evidence which was already flimsy to start with all of this is just speculation your reading into these events against mine no problem in that thats why we are here but its obvious that i wont change your mind about it aswell as you wont change mine because all that you are presenting is just your interpretation and i cant attack such arguments without writing even more speculative gibberish all i can say is that we agree to disagree about barristans love its certainly platonic a platonic relationship is one that lacks sexual content its idealized by one person and most of the time unrequited i can see how it describes their relationship
asoiaf,removed,lmao
asoiaf,removed,if grrm lives that long we will get a de obviously the last chapter at summerhall
asoiaf,removed,part tbc after randyll tarly isnt responsible for that he feared raising a cowardly weakling for an heir and he did what he thought was best to prevent it perhaps he managed to inadvertently teach sam about how cruel the world can be he tried to instill his harshness into sam to destroy his empathy and kindness which thankfully failed but his neurotic attempts to harshly raise a steelheir backfired completely when we meet sam hes a stuttering wreck with no concept of selfworth all randyll imparted into his son is fear and given just a little positive encouragement or opportunity to shine sam is a wise kind brave young man with a sneaky streak which is something randyll utterly failed to recognize much less hone i think that its not thanks to but in spite of randylls useless parenting before him finished reading both essays on which essay was your favorite
asoiaf,removed,frankly this essay isnt saying anything i havent seen many times with a prompt of the worst parents in westeros randyll tarly is far too obvious a choice for my taste around whom to base an essay in my opinion this author does not succeed in making a tired thesis new and relevant there can be few readers who doubt that randyll tarly was an overly harsh parent as a minor note i find truly problematic the grouping of maegor the cruel with robb stark as both impressive warriors who are bad at politics
asoiaf,removed,cersei will never marry someone who isnt jaime at this point in our history in season of the show this appears to be what will happen and euron wants to marry dany
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,maybe hes right
asoiaf,removed,spoilers production i think that this will be either in the end of episode or during episode my guess for the season based on the leaks is that every other episode will have a major action sequence action scene towards end sea battle danys ambush wight battle
asoiaf,removed,me mad me hate grrm but waste all my time letting everyone know about it oh please even my inner cynic wants to cry reading this
asoiaf,removed,legend has it that there are some scriptures floating around a famous bay where pirates meet to exchange locations peer to peer you should look into it
asoiaf,removed,so dany loses the dornish and tyrell support lanisters have the reach the ironborn and casterly rock plus the iron throne thats if the spoilers are to be believed of course seems more like a setup for a war than peace just my two pennies
asoiaf,removed,would you be able to find that for me
asoiaf,removed,the spoilers are probably true no please no i cant handle another ep with level of quality writing season had and the spoilers make it sound much worse then if that was at all possible
asoiaf,removed,if joffery didnt die he probably would of done all that
asoiaf,removed,in the world of asoiaf there are many worse things than necrophilia what the fucking freys and boltons did for a start
asoiaf,removed,classic opposition labelling everything as bad writing get trigged pansy
asoiaf,removed,pretty sure you just defeated your own argument there bud
asoiaf,removed,never seen so many butthurt dany fans on one thread its appalling really
asoiaf,removed,season was the best season of the showyou are fucking retarded
asoiaf,removed,i read the title in donald trumps voice dd are nasty nasty guys they dont know what they are doing they are failures and many many people tell me mr trump you could do a much better job at making the tv show many many respectable people many big names believe me
asoiaf,removed,the title itself is spoily there was no need to put that into those last moments there i hope some mod edits this
asoiaf,removed,dude
asoiaf,removed,yeah ops post is one of the more retarded things ive seen here
asoiaf,removed,this is insanely stupid also charlie
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,yeah would explain the whole brothel thing
asoiaf,removed,waddup
asoiaf,removed,but when you come to a sub like this its where the people who hate it and want to nitpick every detail have the loudest voice ive got almost reasons why this particular sentence is completely wrong
asoiaf,removed,i gave you an answer but as it turns out you seem to possess some form of mental retardation so you were unable to read it and my mother told me never to argue with a fool goodnight you special special boy you
asoiaf,removed,of course its an opinion this sub is fucking retarded if i said tupac was the best rapper of all time what do you think that is just because im not specifically stating that its an opinion and not a fact doesnt mean it isnt an opinion this sub is fucking retarded
asoiaf,removed,when the books were released that was what political cunning looked like when the episode aired political cunning lookssounds like donald trump eurons going to build a tremendous iron fleet and make the lords of the greenlands pay the iron price for it heck he even talked about his dick in an election debate
asoiaf,removed,i havent and i dont intend to but i dont think any of them have a following like got
asoiaf,removed,i guess well soon find out if hillary has the fattest cock
asoiaf,removed,most of us that are old enough to have been with the books from the beginning didnt grow up with social media so we dont struggle as much to disconnect from it also most people i associate with arent dicks its not that hard
asoiaf,removed,agreed it was similar to hrc and trump asha i have just cause and will be a rightful leader euron her derr penis size
asoiaf,removed,euron i will build a giant fleet of ships and the mainlanders are going to pay for it we never win anymore with me were going to win and win and win its time we maketheislesgreatagain yara yes im a lady but im trying to focus on this idea i have i think wed benefit from theon i tried but yara is my sister and much better than euron im seeing quite a few parallels quite a few likely unintentional
asoiaf,removed,first off i do not compare hodor to the victims of the charlie hebdo attack i just used a term connected with the sympathy and memorial for them and adapted it by no means do i mean any disrespect for the victims of the charlie hebdo attack or the people touched by it i am fine with people expressing that they dont like this and think its bad taste as a comment below does what i dont really understand is why this gets removed by mods i havent been aware of violating a rule so would you mind telling me which rule i violated with this in case my violation is simply bad taste might i respectfully suggest to the mods to not delete such post would it not be better in such a case for the other users of the subreddit to downvotedowncomment such a post and to be able to respectfully discuss why this might be bad taste in that case i might well have deleted the post by myself if i had seen people are upset by it isnt that a far better and more transparent solution than removing it by mods for bad taste
asoiaf,removed,because hes a pussy and trump is going to win the general
asoiaf,removed,hillary is out
asoiaf,removed,we dont have victories anymore have you seen what yara did at winterfell shameful if im elected were going to build a yuuge fleet its going to be spectacular really and were going to make westeros pay for it were going to get some fabulous dragons and were going to knock the hell out of westeroes
asoiaf,removed,thats weird brienne should take what she can get shes an ugly cunt and tormund is a fucking adonis
asoiaf,removed,appealing to popularity is a logical fallacy bro also youre strawmanning pretty hard if you put men from arizona in the middle of quebec in the middle of winter and told me of the best men of quebec sabotaged half their army id believe you in a heartbeat i dont understand why you think terrain and preparedness doesnt matter i know you would considering you believe ramsay could pull off such a stupid maneuver off but doesnt matter because northerners dont have radars on them nor the ability to see very well in a blizzard i dont think you understand how awful this blizzard is supposed to be i know that the show really understated it visually due to costs but its not the type of blizzard you could see well in this isnt a goddamn formation this is an encampment horses food and siege equipment would all be separated from each other you cant light shit and expect a spreading fire in the middle of a blizzard yes you can light things on fire but itd die pretty quickly cmon use your brain
asoiaf,removed,grrm making subtle jabs at formalized religion christianity in particular plus theres all that mercury and plastic waste in the feesh they eat
asoiaf,removed,we will build ships and make the starks pay for them which starks sire shit
asoiaf,removed,i watched it earlier today and forgot my window was open during the hodor scene someone walked by and said dafuq is this nigga watching
asoiaf,removed,the actor that plays young ned stark has a small scene in episode and an important scene in episode so i guess we will see the inside in episode
asoiaf,removed,sohes a retard whisperer
asoiaf,removed,im looking at you linda
asoiaf,removed,what about the guy thats got every detail of every episode right before they aired that says its benjen
asoiaf,removed,i wouldnt even give him a second chance if i were you hes
asoiaf,removed,no shes just still a huge bitch she goes running to john to protect her and the second she gets her power in full he will just be a bastard again i have a half sister who did exactly that total bitch constantly putting down my dad her step father even though he busted his ass to give her everything she had a few strokes and she was nice until she recovered now shes as big of a bitch as ever she only seems happy when she putting someone down mark my words she will betray jon the episode after she becomes queenofdanorth i just hope that jon bitch slaps her and shoves robs will down her stupid bitch mouth while sayingim the kingofdanorth risen from death the prince who was promised and king of the seven kingdoms you bitch then ghost eats her for getting his sisters head cut off by lying like the bitch she is
asoiaf,removed,lol you made uadmiralkird look like uadmiralturd
asoiaf,removed,this comment was removed for including a racial slur regardless of your intentions in including that term we cannot reapprove this comment unless you edit it out thank you
asoiaf,removed,nope shes just a bitch
asoiaf,removed,are you a fucking moron clearly youre the one whos not understanding simple sentences he didnt say or mean a theory has to be true the theory is completely without chance of ever coming true how can it even be a theory if its as stupid as claiming there could be ancient god under our earth creating gravity you cant say its unlikely its just fucking false dipshit
asoiaf,removed,can we stop adding undiscussed something were forgetting to shit thats been mentioned dozens of times i knew what this was going to be about before i even clicked on it
asoiaf,removed,is it legitimate if its the one about jon bringing the two wights to the south and then them going to fight the others and cersei gets married to jaime and all that i read that crap leaked script can you link me to the real one please i dont care about spoilers
asoiaf,removed,everyone who read this needs to listen to some preston jacobs just to clean their ears from this filth
asoiaf,removed,george pls
asoiaf,removed,well flip it around say jesus came back and was like gay sex is definitely a sin gay marriage is not allowed what would you do
asoiaf,removed,i wish the mods could make a sticky post or something is that how it works to this conversation because we literally get this post probably every other day why people dont just look it up is beyond me but seriously
asoiaf,removed,i hope bran wargs into jaime and scrambles his brain and turns him into a retarded vegetable
asoiaf,removed,the invasion of the wildlings at castle black was just amazing to watch am i the only one who wasnt able to see much it was too dark either i watched from a poverty torrent or hbo should make more daytime battles was so happy bastard bowl was during the day
asoiaf,removed,some of them some not im glad that you backed away from your claim that these were the truth instead of mere speculation shows that you are learning something at least
asoiaf,removed,the actors signed for seasons if they make maybe some of them would not come back would you really like to see nicolas cage as jon snow they can barely manage to film episodes per season this way they still have the actors time to focus on their episodes and dedicate more budget to each one so yeah theres a reason behind this not sure if your complaint was real or youre a troll or just a fucking idiot
asoiaf,removed,this is the most hilarious thing ive read today enjoy like without game of thrones grrm is done writing buddy
asoiaf,removed,same reason i was glad to see hodor die this subthe fanbase as a whole cant enjoy something without frothing at the mouth and becoming autistic about it until its ruined
asoiaf,removed,i think you were trying to make this ¯ツ¯ type it like this ¯ツ¯ i am a bot visit rarmfixerbot for more info
asoiaf,removed,is this one of those fancy circlejerk thingy please let me know
asoiaf,removed,dont be a faggot
asoiaf,removed,dont be a fag
asoiaf,removed,hodor was a book theory im talking about a theory specific to the showverse that came true did the bwb slaughter the villagers because lsh ordered them to for harboring the hound nope just a rouge faction was lady crane septa lenore no just a regular character w offscreen death was jaquen dressed up as arya to test the waif no arya is just the worst assassin who ever lived they were just some of the more mild theories that relied on using occams razor that ended up being true the knights of the vale coming to save the day isnt even a mild theory it was the most cliched thing that could have happened
asoiaf,removed,interesting theory ive always thought she was more than just an avenue for people to wonder if jon really was neds bastard theres clearly some mystery revolving around her death harrenhal tourney and relationship with the starks septa lemore i never really looked into beyond unconventional septa so now im going to have to go back and have another look at their descriptions
asoiaf,removed,you jest but im with you this subreddit has gotten boring these past weeks and thats coming from a guy who has watched the same book theories get recycled every month on this subreddit but with the show surpassing the books the time is ripe for new book discussion and theories alongside some new twow chapters however those book threads are always buried in favor of reactions to the latest episode or a dumb show theory that will finally give us lsh we arent getting lsh get over it and move on
asoiaf,removed,another idea for the father of asharas baby is aerys the mad king ashara was dismissed as a lady in waiting to his wife barriston selmy could simply be wrong but the question of who is the father still serves the story
asoiaf,removed,nothing thats the wrong sub i cant actually link to it or me tonight it by name without getting banned there is a lot of bad blood between that sub and the mods of the main subs so the mods refuse to let anyone mention it by name the cause of the split was the start of season back when the first episodes were leaked online the people who watched the leaked episodes wanted to discuss it but the mods wouldnt allow it because you had to pirate the episodes in order to watch them there was a pretty big shit storm about it on rgameofthrones where the mods dropped the hammer and removed and banned anyone who mentioned things from the episodes a portion of the community thought it was hypocritical that they allowed discussion of leaked information in the past but suddenly refused any kind of compromise over the leaked episodes they gave a series of excuses as to why they wouldnt allow discussion but each excuse was flimsier than the last the people who had enough of the bullshit left and started their own subreddit
asoiaf,removed,hahaha you must really like crap that place is shit
asoiaf,removed,i was planning on doing the same thing but i accidently heard about hagar betraying lord andrel then killing his family and stealing the iron throne so i went ahead and just watched the show
asoiaf,removed,the information is there a careful viewer could easily make the connection it just depends on how closely you watch tv shows d d are teaching to the top of the class my boyfriend figured it out himself and hes a show watcher only and then my idiot coworker whom i have mentioned on other threads before is a book purist but did not pick up on this yet my mom thinks ned is the father and lyanna is the mothersmh
asoiaf,removed,still id orgasm for a studio ghibli production hell even gonzo would be perfect they did a wonderful adaptation of the count of monte cristo
asoiaf,removed,to be honest thats just dumb or delusional
asoiaf,removed,read this as if hillay clinton is saying it totally she tirelessly has worked so hard to be the first woman president back and constantly been battling with these men trying to prove herself as a real contender and a real player and she kind of feels like she deserves the recognition for it but shes not satisfied now i think shes got a lot more things on her checklist to do before shes completely satisfied sansa is basically saying that its her turn just because thats not what a leader would do
asoiaf,removed,too early fuck off
asoiaf,removed,we definetly need one with ungreg and septa saying its raping time
asoiaf,removed,do it nerd ill just make a new account
asoiaf,removed,im about to unsubscribe here i cant take another months of this kind of bs and the upvote whores who write nonsense
asoiaf,removed,you think the notes are good read the transcription i was scared and aroused in a way i havent felt in a long time
asoiaf,removed,wow ur an idiot of the highest degrees
asoiaf,removed,my account is years old and i have more karma than you can ever dream of bitch
asoiaf,removed,okay thank you for your mercy
asoiaf,removed,confused viewer here weighing in half the posts in this thread belong on riamverysmart im confused about whats going on because i dont care watching got is a chore for me i watch because im this deep into it i guess ill keep going but the story is blah the characters are uninteresting and oh god the books i cant do a full page of that awkward inane prose ive tried many times i just dont understand why fantasy books cant be well written its like some kind of universal rule anyway the real reason why i dont follow the show very well is because only very smart people can follow the show and im a big dummy
asoiaf,removed,theyd hire the fm who just conveniently allowed arya stark to run off with fm powers since cersei is already on her list who is related to jon snow who already made a deal with the iron bank
asoiaf,removed,lsh will happen when you get a girlfriend
asoiaf,removed,tell him to fuck off to rgameofthrones
asoiaf,removed,go back to that original discussion thread you will see such fucking pieces of shit saying exactly by showing theon and not focusing on sansa they make the rape about theon and not what is happening to sansa these people are fucking idiots
asoiaf,removed,riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,na its cuz shes the dyke from pyke
asoiaf,removed,man would that be gay
asoiaf,removed,no natalie dormer so disappointing considering that this mightve been her last chance
asoiaf,removed,they will shout wylis or for maximum nerdiness walder
asoiaf,removed,based off the title i clicked on this post expecting some positive thoughts on why you personally love the book series but instead i got the usual negative bullshit about the show thats been regurgitated million fucking times in this sub disappointing
asoiaf,removed,i roll my eyes every time when i discuss the books with someone and they try to pass show canon as real canon sorry but sentences like this are enough to have a strong opinion about the worth of your opinion and i can imagine that people who only watch the show feel even worse about it
asoiaf,removed,dude go read racefortheironthrone he has a pretty substancial ironborn tag in which among other things he adresses the supreme idiocy of balon that is if you really want am honest counter to your weak arguments if all you want to hear is your echo keep going
asoiaf,removed,we all know the tv shows awful plot holes man the show haters are really out in force lately
asoiaf,removed,milk it into my sisters soup
asoiaf,removed,back to preston jacobs heathan none shall spread false tales about lord eddard and our one true king jon ot the houses targaryen and stark
asoiaf,removed,they die think of how often the seven kingdoms are at war when the kingsguard used to be the best warriors in the realm robert and joffreys kingsguard suck so in war times they are generals or fight in battle alongside princes on top of politics with the chances of being assasinated or poisoned barristan is the only kingsguard george has written about that lives to be old
asoiaf,removed,arya uses lyannas face to fuck jon thus fulfilling those grrm originally wanted a love angle between arya and jon posts
asoiaf,removed,like that matters ins asoiafgot
asoiaf,removed,did it also taste like cum ive heard it tastes like cum
asoiaf,removed,meera get over here and ride me like a white walker riding an ice spider big as a hound and then go make me a sandwich woman awww yeah
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,hillary clinton thinks shes the shit but the true players above her control her actions vengeful and spiteful read emails about ghadaffi vicious and savage see campaign against obama her regime changes across the middle east and people say shes an alcoholic
asoiaf,removed,trump
asoiaf,removed,the over arching point is that its nice as a fan of the series to be able to blow off steam at random friends because theyre all watching as to your second point well it wasnt it was answered with a series of omitted comments which included my answer thanks photoshop but ill keep in mind that i should work on my title game i didnt realize it would attract the two biggest cocksuckers on asoiaf new
asoiaf,removed,well my university roommate streams it from one of those torrent websites at like on sunday while i go home to watch it at i caved and decided to get hbo now since i wanted to watch it in hd away from home thanks man
asoiaf,removed,please remove the portions of your post relating to psychoanalytical analysis against the other poster and we can let this through
asoiaf,removed,didnt you know that leavers were racist retarded and low income senior citizens it is known
asoiaf,removed,sure because how else would poor americans get their cocaine it takes a lot of courage and ambition to smuggle it in
asoiaf,removed,please check out our httpswwwredditcomrasoiafaboutrules in the sidebar in specific portions of your argument youre going after your perception of the person on the other end rather than the argument the other person is making this is considered rude if you disagree with another person and want to refute what theyre saying thats fine but dont make it personal
asoiaf,removed,yes that is fine
asoiaf,removed,im going to make sure i keep checking in on you please please please please please find a way to secretly record the video or audio of her watching the red wedding go down those reactions when they arent faked are amazing
asoiaf,removed,i am no trump supporter what he meant when he said that was theyre bringing crime their rapists and some i assume are good people he wasnt calling all of them rapists
asoiaf,removed,what a relief without this context i wouldve thought that trump had just painted an illinformed xenophobic caricature of a group comprising millions of people
asoiaf,removed,maybe he could hold a door
asoiaf,removed,what would that be realistically
asoiaf,removed,no she definitely did grant then independence as long as they respect the integrity of the seven kingdoms and then do no reaving then they did a hand shake as equal queens instead of bending the knee did you not notice that part i thought a misogynistlesbian wouldve noticed something like that even if they didnt show a hand shake respecting the integrity of the kingdoms doesnt have to mean what you think it does it could mean the more obvious intrepretation they were going for
asoiaf,removed,apparently shows funding
asoiaf,removed,speaking as somebody whos written novels the beginning is easier to write especially if youre a gardener type i am definitely not a planner pulling everything together in a way that makes sense is a challenge grrm has approximately pages to align with and a lot to accomplish in not that much space id bet real money that it took grrm longer to write the last of asos than the first add to that several other factors adding dorne the iron islands and aegon to the mix makes everything a lot harder generally more ponderous less quick paced style we saw in feastdance makes it a lot slower work to produce a single complete chapter if his average chapter went from being pages to pages that means he has to write more to accomplish the same thing from a story perspective frankly and i hate to say this but the book likely has structural issues not as bad as the infamours meereenese knot but still not easy grrm essentially lopped off the climax of adwd to save for twow aka the two big battles so now he has the problem of having a novel inside his novel he has to reintroduce the storylines around the battles of ice and fire very quickly resolve them and then start a whole new arc and bring that to a satisfying conclusion this is probably compounded by the fact that im guessing grrm doesnt want to do the same thing again with twow otherwise hes going to end up with books instead of if i had been grrms editor the manuscript of adwd would have been ripped to shreds and i would have sent him back to stitch it back together with his stone age word processor but he has to work with what was published and thats sure to be a challenge he has a lot more commitments then than he did in the hes tried to cut back on them but hes famous now more deadline flexibility i know he says he works best without deadlines but i bet he never would have blown multiple deadlines by months between agot and acok and acok and asos its hard to keep the fire burning at his age not a lot of creative types do hell not a lot of people generally do other people his age are looking at retirement hes looking at probably another years of work on this if he doesnt die first a pen clutched in his frozen fingers
asoiaf,removed,i keep going back and forth on this on one hand im like can an info dump about what happened to cersei in five years really be worse than an info dump about the folklore of cracklaw point on the other hand there are some storylines you just cant do that with at all i suspect that stannis was actually his biggest issue he either had to have stannis sitting at the wall for five years or resolve his storyline off screen i dont see any way the guy continues his campaign for five years
asoiaf,removed,the poll results arent really that surprising considering
asoiaf,removed,you missed what i presume was a trump quote about mexicans immigrants theyre rapists theyre theives and some i assume are good people
asoiaf,removed,you voiced your concern in the nicest way possible and still ate downvotes feminism
asoiaf,removed,than come on dude you have read these books how can you still get it wrong
asoiaf,removed,not really regardless the faith militant are done in ep so her double agent plot wont really be relevant anyways i think the double agent plot was meant to get olenna out of kings landing
asoiaf,removed,yea so expensive tell us more globalist like what does globalism have to offer middle class and poor natives of any western nation i mean besides the complete destruction of their cultures and societies the loss of their cultural identities the loss of their livelihoods and the loss of their national sovereignty please enumerate the benefits for the rest of us we understand the benefits to the bankers
asoiaf,removed,you are to unintelligent to understand the point of quentyn and dany chapter enjoy your hollywood fanservice show
asoiaf,removed,the filthy neckos on this sub how not to open a comment if you want me to take you seriously or starting a sentence with the truth is and then following that with an opinion they only complain when dd take liberties that make no god damn sense you can say the last two books dragged but at least imho grrm understands his characters and writes logical plots
asoiaf,removed,well instead of kevan we could still have the same scene with pycelle and qyburn instead of kevan
asoiaf,removed,i am pretty sure people have been constant fans of arya split on dany split on sansa not the ones always harping on cat and of course you completely ignore the fact none of those essays on stupid main characters involve blatant abuse like the op the very fact that they are essays and not one line abuse goes against your point i know you will take the downvotes you rightfully deserve of proof of your opinion how is downvotes when sexism is called out on reddit unexpected i was surprised i have not been called sjw yet
asoiaf,removed,predicting
asoiaf,removed,you have spoilers from the leak in your op if you take them out i can reapprove this thanks
asoiaf,removed,you people annoy the fuck out of me
asoiaf,removed,ill bet you a cookie
asoiaf,removed,not even a little bit please promise me you will never become a judge because a judge that thinks like you would be terrifying
asoiaf,removed,youre fucking insane if you honestly think there is any justice in feeding someone to a pack of dogs there is a reason the us constitution has an amendment barring the use of cruel and unusual punishments because they are not just it seems like you would have thrived in nazi germany or somewhere like that if your idea of what constitutes justice is so warped
asoiaf,removed,thats so fucking stupid
asoiaf,removed,joffreytrump confirmed

asoiaf,removed,somehow im not surprised in the slightest that their other posts are from the donald trump subreddit
asoiaf,removed,yeah pretty much instead of being competitive with piracy contentproviders prefer to just sue everything left and right which in the end still nets them less money
asoiaf,removed,are you aware of the statistical life expectancies of men with the bmi that he has i though michelle obama explained this to everyone
asoiaf,removed,lol a brute oh my fucking god i can see why trump has so many supporters god damn pussification of the american male
asoiaf,removed,euron greyjoy is donald trump of westeros came out of nowhere and claimed the seastone chair like donald is claiming the republican nomination also from out of nowhere drowned sawane botley like donald drowned jeb bush defeated both the more moderate asha greyjoy and the traditional ironbornvaluesholding victarion greyjoy in the kingsmoot similar to how donald defeated the moderate marco rubio and traditional conservativevaluesholding ted cruz establishment damphair trying to stop him after its too late similar to the republican party establishments attempts to derail donald after it was too late mysterious connections to magic and warlocks just as donald has seemingly magically captivated the attention of the electorate and even has his own wizard connection david duke cynically taken advantage of the ironborn culture of jingoism bravado and racism and turned it on its head to drive his own secret interests similar to trump selfdescribed highenergy winner that crews a ship of mutes silent majority and is rich from plundering far away kingdoms may have molested his family has weirdlooking lips miiga
asoiaf,removed,the fat man gave up
asoiaf,removed,its good that hes happy jubilant is better than stressed sadly we might never see the book before the world gets blown to hell on january because someone called trumps hands small

asoiaf,removed,yeah but weve all been waiting for so long and hes working on so many other projects and he types so slow and hes old and doesnt look to be in great health either not saying he should rush but maybe he should figure out a way to not go any slower
asoiaf,removed,i hate to say it but grrm wont be living past at this pace he wont be in any shape to finish the series i want him to tell his story i dont need it now but as grim as it may be the clock is ticking
asoiaf,removed,yeah i think its safe to say at this point that we wont be seeing ados at least not from grrm
asoiaf,removed,yea which is what i said in the text nah i think you are wrong after doing a bit on info grrm does say essentially the same thing that sansa and tyrion are the weak links seems to support what i am saying since sansa betrays her family yea and she keeps betraying her family now with jon in winterfel seems like she will do the same probably with baelish
asoiaf,removed,have you seen him in person while hes working if you havent been watching him write in person for the past years how do you know whether hes working hard or not are you upset because he lied to you when he said that he would try to finish the book before season did you think he was saying that with malice and contempt just to spite you probably
asoiaf,removed,hey sorry but i had to remove this thread because the third quote you use in your title is from twow theon i which isnt included in spoilers extended i would suggest either editing your post to remove that quote and maybe replace it or reposting the thread as spoilers everything if youd prefer to just remove the quote which might make sense since this thread has comments on it already just let me know when the quote is gone so i can reapprove thanks
asoiaf,removed,i predict a robert jordan
asoiaf,removed,i dont necessarily believe that i think we will get the end of the series from him eventually i also wouldnt be surprised at all if not but i just currently wouldnt bet that way i just am incredibly confident that twow is so far along itd be nearly impossible to never get something from him at this point oh you sweet summer child you probably havent lived through your grandparents and aunts and uncles and parents dying of old age yet when people get over they tend to pass away at an alarming rate especially if they are overweight george is and morbidly obese at his current writing schedule of years a book with the time increasing for every book he will have to live to be to get them done and i dont know if youve ever been to an old folks home but they dont have any obese people there they dont live long enough to make it to that stage
asoiaf,removed,honestly fuck george rrm i dont even care anymore ill just watch the show
asoiaf,removed,im honestly thinking it wont come out unless he leaves whatever notes he does get done on it to someone else so they can finish it hes and morbidly overweight id be surprised to see him make it past the stress that trying to right this book only exacerbates his health issues hes definitely going to develop some sort of cardiovascular disease
asoiaf,removed,yeah im still right tho get rekt boyo jk
asoiaf,removed,why would the others trust him they might not even know they are doing his bidding bloodraven has a glass candle he can give people visions in their dreams it was enough to get bran to go north of the wall dany to believe prophecies out of nowhere and euron to be euron i think it can manipulate the others too glass candles are probably the most powerful weapon in asoiaf by far why fight someone when you can manipulate their dreams so they serve your goals even if they dont know it what are they trying to accomplish in the first place thats for bloodraven to know and us to find out later we got two books left after all why would br need to be in a sealedoff cave that wights cant get into chances are the others dont know bloodraven is manipulating them and he is keeping up appearances you dont just come out and tell the people you are manipulating that you are manipulating them you play on their fears desires etc you cant just say hey so your enemies the children are your best bros now youre going to serve them and do what they say because no one would ever go for that why did the wights attack bran when he got near the cave same as above if he just wants to get the right targaryen back on the throne he doesnt if he did he would have kept bobbys rebellion from happening instead of causing it mad king gets dreams and visions out of nowhere hears people whispering to him sounds like a glass candle to me if thats not his motivation what is thats still a mystery he could be trying to destroy technology mens destruction of nature wipe out dragons lots of possibilities i really doubt its as simple and ungrrmlike as sit jon on the throne or something like that in that case why do we have this whole littlefinger storyline if the stuff br is doing will make him look inconsequential why have robb when jon will unite the north and become kotn why have cersi if littlefinger and qyburn play circles around her why have gendry when edric storm is a bastard closer to the throne because its a long series everything plays its small or big part and skipping the journey for the endgame is boring and would give us books instead of gravedigger reveal we already had this its incredibly obvious as for the others of those are just stupid shit that will never exist and i have no idea why you added it in unless you wanted to annoy me by wasting time reading what i assume is a stupid attempt at humor
asoiaf,removed,maybe you can say that you know hes not a puppet of yours for you to whip and pros and verbally abuse because you think he should be writing faster just a thought also retard is highly offensive though if your choice for president wins im sure trump will use it in abundance in his inauguration speech cheers mate
asoiaf,removed,if were talking about sophie turner seems a bit low
asoiaf,removed,you must be really insecure about your tiny place in the world if this is whats important to you id say you must be fun at parties but that would require you being tolerable and we all know theres no cure for being a cunt
asoiaf,removed,jons spokeswoman lyanna mormont certainly mustve mentioned something if jon didnt
asoiaf,removed,userbutterbumps what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
asoiaf,removed,the umbers most likely arent any less savage then the freefolk ill listen to the chapter again on my way home
asoiaf,removed,because them caring that some southerners brothers were killed by another guy from the south doesnt make sense with how we are told a lot of the freefolk look at jon as a turncloak some respect him sure the whole mance and spearwives plot is weird to begin with and them getting upset with theon made it stand out even more to me they may like jon but what do they care if theon says winter is coming seemed out of character
asoiaf,removed,good to know was it the summer child thing other people have complained about that i didnt know it was an unliked phrase or is it just talking about the realities of the human life span and the effects of obesity i know a lot of reddit doesnt like to be reminded that parts of their lifestyle arent healthy and will end badly in years it would be helpful to know so i can adjust my behavior in the future
asoiaf,removed,well fingers would be symbolic of the dragons and number of betrayals for dany
asoiaf,removed,can we finally reference that other subreddit without being automatically banned
asoiaf,removed,new knew
asoiaf,removed,hes not very objectively correct if he initially supported marco rubio like his got stuff wish he would lay off the politics
asoiaf,removed,jesus we need a new book to talk about
asoiaf,removed,cracked used to be really funny but it got very social justiceish and then just dropped off entirely theres not anything overly wrong with that its just that of the time comedy suffers when it gets put below send a message on the writers priority list the humor used to be great there because it was so varied you could get some very intelligent humor and then click the next list and get some hilarious slapstick joke but now everything is reasons white people are bad and it cost them when was the last time you read a cracked article recently in the last months or so they seemed to be getting back to where they were but thats just my opinion offtopic but the same thing happened with cinema sins used to just be two dudes making fun of movies and then eventually they put being white as a sin for themselves unironically
asoiaf,removed,at no point did i have any intention to mislead anyone and you can go fuck yourself with your snide little insinuations
asoiaf,removed,there is one thing people misunderstand about the varyslittle finger dynamic the two are not competing or playing against each other varys does not disapprove of little fingers activities varys disapproves of the timing not the deeds every ploy that impoverishes delegitimizes and corrodes the regime serves varys long term plans varys prefers these activities to occur with the golden companyjon conningtonfaegon are ready so yes varys could have outed little finger at that moment indeed he could have even saved jon arryn but did nothe actually warned jon arryn and told him to hire a food tester this means varys is aware of little fingers most private activities varys objective is to weaken the kingdom for faegon to step in and be the savior so all little fingers chaos is a ladder activity serves varys just fine
asoiaf,removed,is she the bad poosi
asoiaf,removed,not a big fan most of grrms female characters are some mixture of narcissistic petty sociopathic and just plain dumb thats why i like him so much he writes women more accurately than any writer ive ever seen d
asoiaf,removed,thats dumb the context matters dont pull a batman batman is retarded
asoiaf,removed,spoilers everything apparently not
asoiaf,removed,it wont need to fall bran has been marked if he crosses the wall the wall becomes useless
asoiaf,removed,i can pm you them if you are so ready to see a list of spoilers
asoiaf,removed,i posted this about hours before the episode came up online streaming websitestorrent websites my information came from someone who was one of the first to watch it on hbo nordic most of the information is correct but the details arent there
asoiaf,removed,wights kill hodor whilst he is holding the door nights king kills three eyed raven
asoiaf,removed,i say fuck the internet for bringing in spoilers and fuck the dmca if you need to torrent get a httpswwwreviewsdircomvisittotalvpn first and then download the show via torrents stay safe lads

asoiaf,removed,its too bad satin isnt in the show you just know hes the kind of guy who can juryrig a strapon with whatever the nights watch just happened to have on hand
asoiaf,removed,underrated spoiler slip maisie let slip that faye marsay wasnt with us anymore paraphrasing in an interview translation she kills that nigga while escaping from the faceless men this season
asoiaf,removed,in light of hodors life of sacrifice i have created a petition calling for obama to honour him with a permanent monument please take some time out of your day to help this man get the thanks he deserves httpswhgovisivg
asoiaf,removed,im trying so hard not to tell you what it actually means
asoiaf,removed,the op was right but they will probably delete this before you see
asoiaf,removed,unless hodor comes from words like hole in the door hold the door hoes in the door home door ho whore door etc
asoiaf,removed,mods i think this guy has seen the leaked episode
asoiaf,removed,the season spoilers say what happensdoesnt happen to bran and meera after fleeing the cave theyve been right about everything so far so id say theyre all confirmed not gonna link it here but if you cant find them id be happy to pm you
asoiaf,removed,what annoyes you about it
asoiaf,removed,because sansa has littlefinger killed and the children of the forest kill meera
asoiaf,removed,hodor dying
asoiaf,removed,remember that scene in the matrix where sentinels attack the ship and neo is still inside the matrix pretty much
asoiaf,removed,sweet summer children
asoiaf,removed,cant wait to see more of this new red priestess and her bewbs
asoiaf,removed,good job you douchebags morning news usa way to spoil it for everyone and claim having figured it out using reddit theories just say you watched the leaked episodes
asoiaf,removed,that actor twink
asoiaf,removed,whats the name of the act ressurser playing sansa in the theatre scene
asoiaf,removed,so does that make the us hypocrites when they lambast muslims for wearing hijabs or wut
asoiaf,removed,it seemed like in the cave hodors eyes turned white for a moment indicating that bran warged into him did bran simultaneously warg into hodor and remain in the vision to observe what happened to young hodor if so was his consciousness in two places at once
asoiaf,removed,we will find out about why hodor says hodor mark my words and the time
asoiaf,removed,cant handle a little friendly banter lad
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,hold the door
asoiaf,removed,ill say i think the is the last greenseer and all those who hold the title so watch the episode tonight and i wont say more
asoiaf,removed,im too far east so by the time a decent torrent comes out its already tuesday
asoiaf,removed,no more white walkers for season
asoiaf,removed,poor hodor
asoiaf,removed,its a huge episode pretty sure my gf was crying hit right in the feels
asoiaf,removed,people who propose roberts rebelion as prequel are not intelligent
asoiaf,removed,yeah seen it holy shit also hordor that mind fucked me so hard
asoiaf,removed,yes i agree the ice dragons are a solid mistylike creature only seen when the sun is not shining like others this is why it always has to be overcast when the wws others are seen they are like bran in that they are in their own watermist dimension kinda like shadows in that respect less so in the show moreso in the books ive read the books years ago and have forgotten so much ice dragon riders well this is where characters like arienne and such get lost in the shuffle but everything asoiaf is mirrord parelell stories id think that ice dragons riders must be dead and the ice dragons might be evil but not sure so people like dead ned or dalla could be ice dragon riders too much unknwn right now to know bran now has the mark the nk touched him and his arm was white and blue later on it was covered so we didnt see what came of it bran will never walk again but he will fly
asoiaf,removed,dont know how i feel about episode already have been leaked
asoiaf,removed,oh you sweet summer children
asoiaf,removed,hold the door
asoiaf,removed,was anyone else getting massive trump vibes from the kingsmoot euron enters out of nowhere is incredibly flippant gets the crowd going and then literally promises them the world he doesnt just admit to killing his brother aka the establishment he gloats about how stale and stagnant balon had become and how he was ultimately disconnected from the ironborn the electorate by the time of his death the implication being euron is the man of the people and hes here to make the iron islands great again and he wins by a landslide extend that to yara standing in for hillary and well its for everyone else to fill in the gaps
asoiaf,removed,who is ready for reddit to crash in about an hour and minutes
asoiaf,removed,i have actually the show will be there in the morning
asoiaf,removed,not exciting at all sadly
asoiaf,removed,i wonder if bran will break on through to the other side in this episode
asoiaf,removed,well hes been warning bran to not linger theres probably much he has to learn
asoiaf,removed,okay what the fuck was that ending
asoiaf,removed,its pretty damn good and no your body isnt ready
asoiaf,removed,i just saw this it was pretty spectacular
asoiaf,removed,you guys better hang on to your asses
asoiaf,removed,hope we see more of hodor this episode hes my favorite character i wanna see him ride a dragon in
asoiaf,removed,its a good episode but its not worth getting a bad grade over
asoiaf,removed,watching it again
asoiaf,removed,its one of the best episodes of television ive ever seen its up there with ozymandias from breaking bad nothing can prepare you for this episode
asoiaf,removed,no spoilers but top episodes of the show for sure cant wait to watch it again at a better quality
asoiaf,removed,not sure who to tell but they linked to the episode preview not
asoiaf,removed,its one of the best in terms of plot movement but theres some stupid shit as well
asoiaf,removed,the doorhmmm
asoiaf,removed,the nights king with the fatherly advice tonight
asoiaf,removed,i dont know if all the dothraki are now loyal to dany just because they bowed to her last week i mean if emilia clarke was standing naked in front of me id drop to my knees too its just a natural reaction
asoiaf,removed,am i watching the right streamhas the episode started yet
asoiaf,removed,summer dies hodor dies bloodraven dies euron wins kingsmoot yara and theon sail off with the iron fleet sansa lies to jon about the tullys kinvara was the voice at varys torture
asoiaf,removed,hold the door
asoiaf,removed,i dont know what im more excited forthe episode or the internetwide mental breakdowns that are going to follow
asoiaf,removed,that was fucking devastating weirwood feedback loop for his entire life
asoiaf,removed,warningthis episode has a surprise dick shot
asoiaf,removed,oh my god that was amazing
asoiaf,removed,on one hand the episode was awesome the hodor stuff was chilling as well a that entire last scene danys story seems to actually be going somewhere and the arya stuff was cool to see loved the play however i cant help but feel like the show is turning into some sort of time travel thingy and i really dont want that to happen time travel is so overdone and seems like a total copout storywise i mean now the answer to a lot of stuff is just bloodravenbran did it and it usually just creates more questions and confusion than before as paradoxes emerge and weird shit starts to happen secondly that kingsmoot scene was just bad euron just seems like some random pirate dude a huge step down from the awesome scene we had before when he killed balon and why did they remove the whole dragonsbane thing his entrance was so underwhelming compared to the books it was just boring euron is no longer a mad ironborn who sailed the world collected this weird horn from valyria and then used it to convince his people to follow him no now he is just another generic bad guy maybe i am a little biased because of the books but still
asoiaf,removed,oh hodor
asoiaf,removed,hodor
asoiaf,removed,god damn bran causes hodor to be hodor is totally happening poor guy
asoiaf,removed,im not ready for this somebody hold me
asoiaf,removed,summer dies hodor dies bloodraven dies euron wins kingsmoot yara and theon sail off with the iron fleet sansa lies to jon about the tullys kinvara was the voice at varys torture
asoiaf,removed,itt idiots discussing the leaked episode in it entirety two minutes into the live episode poor mods
asoiaf,removed,posting it now the old crypt is gunna be the thing to fuck hodor up and involve expository dialouge about the others
asoiaf,removed,oh look sansa being fucking retarded im so shocked right now
asoiaf,removed,damn i was hoping the origins of the first white walker were something else
asoiaf,removed,i wonder if the children of the forest are actually responsible for creating the white walkers maybe trapped the first men and used them to create the ww
asoiaf,removed,rip summer raven hodor
asoiaf,removed,we got to see sansas tits
asoiaf,removed,hodor

asoiaf,removed,hold the door hodor
asoiaf,removed,holy shit holy shit the white walkers holy shit
asoiaf,removed,maybe we should elect presidents this way from now on we can drown donald trump if he gets elected and if he lives he gets to be president
asoiaf,removed,oh shit this is live right so i can still spoil the end of the episode for you the door
asoiaf,removed,holy fuck those ideas about the cotf and the ww were true
asoiaf,removed,euron just got cucked like the donald user base
asoiaf,removed,httpiimgurcomvalxeztjpg the cotf rock pattern during the creation of the white walkers vs the other two patterns shown for the white walkers
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,hold
asoiaf,removed,yes bran you fucked up
asoiaf,removed,hold it
asoiaf,removed,u want me to spoil the end of the episode because i fuckin will on a side note nonspoiler about the end right in the feels man
asoiaf,removed,wel that cotfww reveal was unexpected
asoiaf,removed,hodor
asoiaf,removed,hold the door
asoiaf,removed,if the children of the forest had awesome fire grenades why did they need the fricken whitewalkers in the first place
asoiaf,removed,summers wimps fading into the background
asoiaf,removed,not summer
asoiaf,removed,hold the door
asoiaf,removed,o shit she allah akbard herself

asoiaf,removed,trump appproves
asoiaf,removed,h
asoiaf,removed,bran destroyed jojen summer hodor bloodravenand he cant even sit and trip acid now the caves gone and he cant even fuck meera now hodors gone
asoiaf,removed,god damn the ironborn are retards

asoiaf,removed,but how about the tits on
asoiaf,removed,crying jesus
asoiaf,removed,udhanikwow ring ring shame ring ring shame ring ring shame
asoiaf,removed,udhanikwow ring ring shame ring ring shame ring ring shame
asoiaf,removed,this show is so gay sometimes they have to know that their viewer base is mostly straight guys like me right i understand the titties because of that but why do they think its a good idea to dangle a beautiful dick out there like that
asoiaf,removed,this was a damn good guess
asoiaf,removed,yara
asoiaf,removed,im starting to think that if trump were to assassinate obama merica would still elect him as president
asoiaf,removed,thats a paradox though to get to the part where bran influences the past the past had to already have been influenced
asoiaf,removed,see also from october clive russell brynden tully was spotted filming at a riverrun set link is minor spoilers
asoiaf,removed,please reupload with a less spoilery title such as it was grrms plan all along
asoiaf,removed,this post is spoilers extended and the bits about the set leaks are only allowed in spoilers everything
asoiaf,removed,this is a spoilers extended not everything thread gotta cover up those spoilers
asoiaf,removed,isnt there a screen grab of jamie on his horse going thru what looks like a lannister war camp jamiebrienne reunion
asoiaf,removed,do you want to hear what he did to me he dipped tortilla chips into my body i can still feel it standing right here in front of you
asoiaf,removed,seriously were all upset about summer making unfunny jokes about cgi budgets at least half of which i think people meant seriously just takes away from the power of it not to mention its fucking stupid and makes whoever says it seem like they have the mental capacity of a gnat

asoiaf,removed,i could stand in the middle of a kingsmoot and say i murdered my own brother and i wouldnt lose a single vote –euron the donald greyjoy
asoiaf,removed,not a single decent post on this entire thread not one the quality of this subreddit has declined faster than jared fogels career can we talk about the time travel paradox that has been created bran can only warg into hodor cuz he has a weak mind but he wouldnt have the weak mind if bran hadnt warged into him how is meera going to drag a brancart through the snow fast enough to get out of there is margaery going to do her walk of shame but be surrounded by an entire army so no one can see her only ghost and nymeria left now will jorah find a cure where is he going to look none of these things are talked about only oh the feels i cried like so much im a useless fucking idiot awful and really disappointing i used to like this subreddit a lot very symbolic of reddit as it increases its main stream appeal and attracts more fucking facebook
asoiaf,removed,i agree or maybe benjen stark or the show could make those the same person even if that is not possible according to the books
asoiaf,removed,sansas butthole still hurts
asoiaf,removed,i nominate donald trump for lord commander of the nights watch
asoiaf,removed,google do you possess it
asoiaf,removed,oh fuck off
asoiaf,removed,dude this is asoiaf reddit if you didnt read the books and is clueless on who bloodraven is just do yourself a favor and look it up on google or try reading the books dont try to create a theory without even reading the fucking books
asoiaf,removed,bran gets seizures when he wargsgreensights in the show books dont have any seizures iirc as to your other point what i find troublesome is the notion that past hodor is affected by his futureself if he was warged by bran then i could understand some sort of connection between the two of them being mind controlled in the same time but otherwise its a very strange thing to have someone get brain fried one day because some years later bran wargs into him meddling with past affecting the future sure but the opposite doesnt make much sense
asoiaf,removed,you know what would fix this you should stop watching the show and stop being a whiny somethingsomething
asoiaf,removed,he wants to convince dany that the only way shell get to westeros is through him so that an ironborntargaryen dynasty will rule westeros
asoiaf,removed,test this then apologize for your post
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit someone in rasoiaf blew my mind about the footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,that is literally retarded
asoiaf,removed,i laughed a lot at euphoric varys also i was really disappointed at euron i imagined him way darker and cooler he is just asshole people from dickhead islands donald trump
asoiaf,removed,what about the captain daughter and her monkey tits
asoiaf,removed,that is the ultimate question right there i for one think the most complicated therefore most likely would be that the timeline would split and an alternate reality would form based on that day in winterfell however if dd had to answer your question i think that they would a come up with some bs that it could not have changed that it would have happened through brans actions one way or the other remember he wanted stay and watch more of his father every time bloodraven took him to a point in neds life so he would probably seek these out on his own or b hodor would have simply went reversefull retard and suddenly would have just been a normal albeit abnormally large man in a dirty cave but these kinds of things hurt my brain since there are so many possible answers to the question you pose infinite answers so really my advice is to pick the one you like the most lol dont rack your brain about something we all will never get an answer to you may end up saying nothing more than hodor if you dwell on it
asoiaf,removed,a much better outcome than giving bernie sanders coppers a day
asoiaf,removed,i always thought ter was brynden plus grrm seems to have confirmed coldhands isnt broken on page the editor scrawls a note to grrm about coldhands is this benjen i think its benjen and does bran never recognize him because he never sees his face fully grrms reply in red pen no
asoiaf,removed,just like bernie and hillary all over again
asoiaf,removed,the night is dark and full of lindas
asoiaf,removed,your right its usually like the whole christian judaism islamic conflicts now its suddenly like the whole christian judaism islamic conflicts
asoiaf,removed,seriously dude i cant sit in a plane doing absolutely nothing without a safety brief and this dickweed throws a child into the whitewater rapids of fucking magic time travel without so much as a oh hey kid were perfectly safe in here unless you do something retarded like go on an unsupervised vision quest and let a white walker touch you you can do anything else you want go nuts so long as you dont get dreamdiddled by papi night king were still golden dig i gotta say this was the weakest episode in the series so far too much was autosolved with magic and too much was taken for granted
asoiaf,removed,did she throw some sort of feminist shitfit about the nudity
asoiaf,removed,did bran cause your autism by warging into you when you were young
asoiaf,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°╯╲卐卐卐卐 dont mind me just taking my mods for a walk
asoiaf,removed,are we watching the same show
asoiaf,removed,if people continue to be cunts like that then banning me would be doing me a favour
asoiaf,removed,being right nobody listening and then having a right being smug about it is the best feeling in the world brofist
asoiaf,removed,i think his primary opponents are the asoiaf communitys version of fundamentalists that dont like to see their headcanon challenged the way you get bent out of shape over a guy making theory videos is ridiculous
asoiaf,removed,are you retarded
asoiaf,removed,i was getting a trump vibe from his speech dick jokes little theon delusions of grandeur i was in no way surprised he was able to convince the iron born to back him and agree to just kill theon and yara the children of the king he just admitted to murdering
asoiaf,removed,it was years ago and he was dismissing a theory rather than proposing his own so im sure hes long forgotten by now buuuuuuut in light of this likely forgettery we need to track him down and let him know
asoiaf,removed,i called hodors origin and no one listened get over yourself
asoiaf,removed,feminism
asoiaf,removed,you quoted me and insulted me so no i replied to you
asoiaf,removed,isnt bernie sanders the one that says huge not trump

asoiaf,removed,if you think that any kind of meaningful conversation can be opened with that im sorry but youre an idiot you need to chill out and reread the conversation this was never going to be meaningful because the subject was opened with someone saying skeptical of religionmust have a small dick youre just jerking yourself off if you think this was ever going to be a constructive dialogue in the first place
asoiaf,removed,my knowledge of this level of westerosi geography is not good from looking at a map it appears youre right it was the first one that sounded good to me plus people are scared of skagos like trump is scared of nonwhites
asoiaf,removed,hmm thats actually kind of funny only on the internet could a throwaway joke be misunderstood as the genuine ravings of some crazy person the world seems like its going crazy
asoiaf,removed,your first paragraph maybe unknowingly just described hillary clinton this election cycle
asoiaf,removed,no hes telling th truth we know jaime is supposed to fulfill his riverland plot from affc also there is a tully banner in a trailer this season on a castle wall
asoiaf,removed,he was a bumbling idiot and so is the guy with his panties in a bunch over my opinion
asoiaf,removed,its working for trump p
asoiaf,removed,hes far from balon all balon did was try and take over some towns on the shore and take what is ours and really achieved nothing he didnt give a flying fuck about a dragon girl at the other side of the world or anything like that the ironborn were bored and fed up with this there was no ambition in their current cause so when a guy comes back whos been gone for years theres this mystery that surrounds him and he promises to make an alliance with the mother of dragons and destroy all the other houses of westeros who have been looking down on them for generations it makes sense in my opinion that some of the people would follow that cause and at least try something radically new its kind of similar to politics in our real world today khmtrumpkhm
asoiaf,removed,the last episodes of the show have been fantastic lol
asoiaf,removed,they were exaggerating to make it funny you understand how comedy works right ever watch snl ever watch how they portray people theyre making fun of is reddit really this idiotic that they cant make the connection here
asoiaf,removed,the only confirmed cotf we have seen are dead however i believe there are rumors of some being at the gods eye also they may continue on in a less direct way as the craggonmen are said to have interbred with them could be false history
asoiaf,removed,we should talk about the actress who plays the actress playing sansa and her tits
asoiaf,removed,man the faith militant at this point is isis from westeros
asoiaf,removed,yeah i keep reading all those she played herself comments i only saw sansa and the finest of tits
asoiaf,removed,yes i do think bran perhaps bloodraven as well is the lord of light the show transitions from kinvara talking about the voice that talked to varys to a shot of bran
asoiaf,removed,now lets go murder clinton and sanders
asoiaf,removed,what the fuck is your problem someone said jorah could deliver greyscale to westeros like joncon does in the books and you asked how im explaining how it could happen they topic is greyscale being introduced to westeros thats why i keep bringing it up
asoiaf,removed,but at the same time do not forget he loves sansa and i am sure he wants her as his queen and anyway on the second trailer for this season i think you see brienne in a hall with tully flags
asoiaf,removed,time travel in asoiaf follows novikovs selfconsistency principle which posits that there is only one timeline and people who go in the past to change the past have already changed the past and that it was destined to happen all along which makes the entire story pointless this means you cannot time travel and makes that aspect of the show completely pointless face it he can change the past and that in itself completely ruins the tory theoretically at any point he could simply jump into the past and stop something from happening and we would see the changes instantly because it is one universe the ink is now dry again as for future implications this means that bran cant change the past to impact the future he cant go back and convince the cotf to not create the first other he cant stop ned from being beheaded or robb from being betrayed he can only interact with the past to cause the timeline to continue as it already has he can or hodor wouldnt have been a fucking doorstop by his action him altering the past caused that he simply has not altered anything else yet in this fucking retarded loop
asoiaf,removed,yara hillary clinton confirmed
asoiaf,removed,the iron trump
asoiaf,removed,aaaaaaaaah okay id forgotten the rest of that explanation side note it was such a tiny little satisfying bit of bookfag fanservice that wunwun smashed the dude against the wall when they entered winterfell in episode
asoiaf,removed,then youre a fucking idiot that was the best chapter in affc by a mile
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,and somehow they decided to go with hes got no willy and talks like a faggot jesus
asoiaf,removed,i do hope youre a troll otherwise i feel deeply sorry for you bye
asoiaf,removed,cringe
asoiaf,removed,we basically got an iron born donald trump
asoiaf,removed,the iron born are the retards of westeros though
asoiaf,removed,but also a weird form of relief his eyes were saying farewell my friends pretty sure thats just you reading too much into it
asoiaf,removed,an audition tape for kinvara leaked last year
asoiaf,removed,because they are basically the taliban just because bernie sanders is leading them and they are fighting the lannister doesnt mean they are good people for example the taliban hates isis
asoiaf,removed,i think most people recognize that and youre kind of a pretentious cunt for thinking they dont
asoiaf,removed,obama bran knows exactly what hes doing
asoiaf,removed,bran will time warg jaime to make him retarded before he can even get his dick out of cersei he will turn him into moonboy cersei will be fucking moonboy for all i know
asoiaf,removed,something something trump something
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,linda wont be happy
asoiaf,removed,you mean faggots
asoiaf,removed,hell yeah titties
asoiaf,removed,represented the same establishment bullshit another point for trump eh
asoiaf,removed,aaaaaahhh cmon you know im right
asoiaf,removed,i saw sadness in his face and fear but also a weird form of relief his eyes were saying farewell my friends i disagree i did not see that as described
asoiaf,removed,no shit can you imagine how big his new asshole would be of he took the time to do an ama before it was finished
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,hahaha its just a comment which the person i commented to saw appreciated for what it was and responded already silly mod bureaucracy
asoiaf,removed,i dont understand that logic he is concerned enough with his health to be upset about the observation that he is in poor health but not concerned enough to do anything proactive about it
asoiaf,removed,are brans warging the ser pouncesized hodors are no threat to the realm
asoiaf,removed,im of the opinion that all baratheon brothers suck in different ways and that none of the make for a great king no robert and stannis are awesome renly is a treasonous piece of shit who sucks dick no pun intended
asoiaf,removed,you guys are going to have to do it through an oujia board
asoiaf,removed,sooooo when donald trump releases his tax returns
asoiaf,removed,of course not how silly there are obviously ser pouncesized brans riding and warging the ser pouncesized hodors
asoiaf,removed,well of course its rude butif i saw that he started doing yoga or swimming laps a couple times a week i wouldnt be as worried about his timeframe to complete this book
asoiaf,removed,if we want a grrm ama we need to start a new sub called rthegrrm of its content could be cross posts from rasoiafcirclejerk oh god that sub do you guys think dd are only pretending to be retarded so that they can use good writing in seasons and as a plot twist good thing dd know the ending to the series this means theyve had plenty of time to think of ways to ruin it xd
asoiaf,removed,george pls
asoiaf,removed,agreed but one hint dont eat the pigeon pie one thing dont call it game of thrones thats what the show is called the book series is a song of ice and fire it makes our stomachs roll over when people call the books got
asoiaf,removed,have you read the latest alayne sample chapter
asoiaf,removed,im sorry but youre misinformed and misread that statement you think robert came up with it all on his own thats very naive aerys demanded the heads of robert and ned and jon refused rebelling against his liege later on jon and the other leaders decided that it would be best if robert took the throne as he had the best ties to the current dynasty you need to read between the lines
asoiaf,removed,donald trump
asoiaf,removed,did i ask you what you think
asoiaf,removed,i think you can be both i love the books along with seasons but season glorified violence and war too much weird for a book series that is severely anti both and sacrificed a lot of plot and character development and internal logic for epic moments still though i totally agree with you the community should stop picking sides between books and show it only makes things worse i happen to not like season but i would never go as far saying fuck the show
asoiaf,removed,i hate to be that girl but it could be possible that when she smiled at jaime she was still alive arya snuck into the twins and then killed that servant cut her face and put it on i think
asoiaf,removed,god i just started coming here after finally getting sick of the other sub and its comments like yours that finally make me feel like im home god forbid you criticize the show in any way over there or you might as well be ramsey bolton
asoiaf,removed,i recommend you spend a little more time on the other sub they all seemed to have interpreted that scene much differently
asoiaf,removed,hrm hairline none too healthy
asoiaf,removed,i sent this comment thread to encyclopedia britannica and wikipedia to be used in the definition of stick in the mud as well as other such metaphors involving a stick inside somewhere
asoiaf,removed,flip a coin bot
asoiaf,removed,hillary is
asoiaf,removed,trump is pretty fat
asoiaf,removed,dear diary today op was a faggot
asoiaf,removed,how to be hugely condescending and a prick
asoiaf,removed,thanks i was quite sad after reading the wiki about him dying in an attempt to hatch dragons
asoiaf,removed,uh it happens over exactly two chapters
asoiaf,removed,plot events happened to make it irrelevant you mean the super foreshadowed plotdriven character changing scene where tyrion kills his own father i dont think thats something you can just cast aside and say just happens to make your dumb implausible theory irrelevant thats straight up ignoring the text
asoiaf,removed,lol by that logic isis totally arent monsters religion or not its all monstrous behavior
asoiaf,removed,what do you think they could mean that its been too long since the last book came out
asoiaf,removed,with good ol rape too
asoiaf,removed,i personally would implore everyone to make their own decision on what lyanna said rather than trust a trained lip reader the reasons why donald trump has a chance of winning the presidency neatly summarised into one sentence fuck trained experts the fuck do they know
asoiaf,removed,but not really
asoiaf,removed,i was gently teasing him stop crying
asoiaf,removed,lol i love how the retard doesnt have an answer to this
asoiaf,removed,i think they mean you really really needs twow
asoiaf,removed,go look in the mirror and tell yourself you havent lost your mind
asoiaf,removed,oh no not downvotes eat shit
asoiaf,removed,ive been posting here for years go circlejerk about how kind and noble you are at somebody else
asoiaf,removed,being concern trolled by idiots who then go crying to mods
asoiaf,removed,and now i downvoted you twice for the same comment anyone who whines about getting downvoted get an automatic downvote from me
asoiaf,removed,cercei is mentally ill dany is childish and retarded liberaldont overread
asoiaf,removed,whats your name
asoiaf,removed,did i exclude aerys kids i remember writing danys name somewhere
asoiaf,removed,im sure that youre one of those dumbasses who thinks of a theory and then considers it bad writing when it turns out to be false i could give you the benefit of the doubt but using your logic i have indisputable evidence that youre stupid
asoiaf,removed,meh if you submit to euron like falia did you are idiot and pretty much deserve it though personally i dont think sacrificing her will any effect on the magic though
asoiaf,removed,jon was just as much a fool for love as robb only he didnt die for it the cleganebowl theory was highly considered one of the most foreshadowed possible event to happen in the future but tommen outlawing trial by combat kind of put a stop to that technically still possible for it to happen in another way but not nearly as much the point is that there is a difference between evidence to possibly support a theory and undeniable proof until the theory actually comes out to be true nothing is proof as you call it youre a fool if you believe otherwise maybe that line is foreshadowing shadow but not that his name is aemon just that hes a targaryen what are you gonna do if it turns out his name was jahaerys or something else all along theres proof for that theory as well so obviously it must be true i guess his name must be aemon jahaerys aegon bran gary stark targaryen after all
asoiaf,removed,in re to roberts claim that is new information in regards to your second point im aware there are many people i left out because they do not have descent even though they did marry into the royal line
asoiaf,removed,stannis and shireen are both there
asoiaf,removed,so i get dogpiled over nothing then defend myself and you run to the aid of the people who dish it out but cant take it civil indeed go fuck yourself ban me
asoiaf,removed,everyone and by that i mean the one other friend i have who likes asoiaf as much as i do who watched me make this through snapchat kept telling me that the arryn family have targaryen blood but i couldnt find it all i found were rodrick and daella making aemma but she married viserys i and all their heirs stayed in the family none of their kids went on to rejoin or marry back into the arryn family
asoiaf,removed,silver pussy
asoiaf,removed,donald trump made it
asoiaf,removed,in a review of the state of modern scholarship bart ehrman wrote he certainly existed as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity christian or nonchristian agrees richard a burridge states there are those who argue that jesus is a figment of the churchs imagination that there never was a jesus at all i have to say that i do not know any respectable critical scholar who says that any more robert m price does not believe that jesus existed but agrees that this perspective runs against the views of the majority of scholars james dg dunn calls the theories of jesus nonexistence a thoroughly dead thesis michael grant a classicist wrote in in recent years no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of jesus or at any rate very few and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger indeed very abundant evidence to the contrary robert e van voorst states that biblical scholars and classical historians regard theories of nonexistence of jesus as effectively refuted
asoiaf,removed,i mean yeah youre correct but you are still a cunt
asoiaf,removed,dat pu
asoiaf,removed,so you can find no support for your side even though i have many supports for mine thanks for the fun
asoiaf,removed,it was meant to be
asoiaf,removed,fuck you george
asoiaf,removed,post this a couple of more times
asoiaf,removed,in season shes in winterfell with needle dammit i was doing so well avoiding spoilers i didnt know extended included production
asoiaf,removed,ill start by saying this is only one mans skewed and grief tinted opinion i in now way expect people to agree with or respect my opinion grrm is not our bitch he owes us nothing and if he decides to abandon asoiaf all togetherin favor of yearly releases of wild cards he has a right to but we the fans have a recourse this will never happen the very idea of it is so tin foil it would cause an aluminum supply crisis but here we go to get the message across there will have to be a complete and total fan blackout no visiting or posting anything on grrms live journal and any associated message boards unfriending unsubscribing and unfollowing grrm on all forms of social media assuring that there is fan presence at any and all conventions related to anything grrm is working on or has him in attendance no purchases of anything with his name associated with it returning every single piece of paper and merchandise associated with grrm directly back to his publishers mailing address from books and dvds to magazines with an ad on the back page freeze him out sales on the day of twow release no fan reviews no youtube videos rasoiaf subscribers viewers and piraters of the final season of the show this is all coming from a deep well of bitterness and disenfranchisement that has been filled to overflowing for some time now before last years new years post debacle and the last two deadlines he blew past i know it comes across as petty and small i know its ridiculous to post this on a subreddit created to discuss his works and talk about how grrm is the second coming of fantasy authors i get a tingle in my fat pink mast at the thought of grrm walking into empty convention hall after empty convention hall with only the press to greet him the vision of phone calls and emails from his publishers wanting to know why of millions of copies of his work have been shipped to there office from all over the world gives me more relief than a thousand false promises of twow being ready by x date the thought of grrm sitting at a fold out table and knowing that hell be sitting for hours without a single person coming up for an autograph brings the same smile that i got reading about the purple wedding grrm receiving an email from his agent informing him that twow sold no physical or digital copies that twow had somehow made negative sales and that booksellers were in fact shipping all his works wild cards and all back to the publishers due to the sudden and inexplicable abandonment of all his works by the fans to whom he owes nothing after all those impossibilities i may just be able to forget my mother weeping at the fact that cancer was going to kill her before she got to know how the series ended when reading the books to her at her bedside was one of the few things to help her forget her pain i may be able to forget the snide remarks and eye rolls from grrm concerning progress on twow and all the itll be done when its done itll be done in a few months no wait lol no it wont im not your bitch grrm owes us nothing hell finish the books when its ready but lets not forget we do not owe him our love we dont owe him our money we dont owe him our attention we dont owe him a pat on the head and a of course its alright to make and break deadline after deadline we dont owe him our expectations we dont owe him our praise the only thing we owe grrm is the same disdain and silence that hes served up to fans that died knowing he doesnt give a damn about finishing what he started
asoiaf,removed,do you already own the books ianal but dont you download copyrighted material all the time and if you have already purchased the books havent you already paid for access to the material
asoiaf,removed,sorry i have to tell you that is extremely insulting i have been saying pretty much the same thing since i joined this forum years ago but i expected a fair amount of criticism because this forum has shown me there will be people who criticize everything and anything no matter what so i can honestly say i am not surprised to see something like this written but yeah go eat a lemon vigorously and dont spit it out keep chewing and chewing and you eat that lemon you do it
asoiaf,removed,i really wish more people would give this theory a chance the comparison between the two are eyebrow raising at least both are great singers which is mentioned over and over for both characters the interest mance has in jon mance and rhaegars natural leadership and the wildling tale ygritte tells to jon when they first meet the parallels between that story rhaegar and leanna and mance taking fake arya from winterfell is alot of very subtle false foreshadowing if it doesnt actually lead to anything tinfoil or not the devil is in the detail grrm undoubtably will have some surprises for us that will seem obvious while rereading it sure would suck to shit on this theory only to eat your foot in a book or two anyway link below takes this theory into far more detail than i ever could ive endulged a lot of theorys but for some reason this one really sticks with me hope more people can agree

asoiaf,removed,oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,it will be like twoiaf linda and elio ghostwriting most of it oh wait that´s fanfic
asoiaf,removed,winds will be released at some point in the next years a dream of spring though i hope he has a lot of notes and good ghost writer because he isnt going to live long enough to publish that one the life expectancy for a man in america is about years old being obese can remove as much as years from that number putting his life expectancy at about he is currently he probably isnt going to live another decade and thats at least how long its going to take him to do a dream of spring sorry everyone this series isnt ever likely to be resolved at least not by the original author
asoiaf,removed,because the fandom is entitled and stupid
asoiaf,removed,i swear this fan base is probably the most selfish of them all why do you feel so entitled
asoiaf,removed,i know its not the same but ive recently learnt after carrie fishers death that film companies insure their actors and film staff in case one can not complete the filming process if publishers had the same hold over authors how expensive would grrm be to insure haha
asoiaf,removed,man these people are lucky the human race doesnt have any convictions and will take an unimaginable amount of shit i would have boycotted both those assholes and responded back with dont forget why you live in your mansion asshole authors are nothing without their readers maybe some of them need that reality check in the sales department but like i said that would require convictions being stronger than a desire to read the next book
asoiaf,removed,maybe next years oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,fans like this are pathetic
asoiaf,removed,hes probably just bashing his bishop all day and using the unfinished manuscript for janitorial purposes
asoiaf,removed,im going to torrent the ebook and if it has actual plot progress and isnt filler food and clothing i will buy it
asoiaf,removed,so by no spoilers you mean i cant talk about han solos death in star wars
asoiaf,removed,hes is a fat lazy old bastard sunbathing in his success and i really cant blame him i would do the same to be honest
asoiaf,removed,ive gotten so much shot over the years for pointing out how little he cares about the books hes literally a fat neck beard with millions of dollars why would he want to work anymore
asoiaf,removed,god what a shitty mentality towards goods and services no wonder corporations rule over us now its this kind of mentality that allows it grrm would be nothing without his fans to buy his books he should take well to remember that but like i said most people have no convictions and will quite literally take any treatment dealt to them its why apple can remove a bunch of shit forcing people to pay more money for the new peripherals and people just eat that shit up slurp slurp bet that dick tastes good
asoiaf,removed,i dont expect anything from him but i dont like him at all and regard him as failed writer at this point he will die before finishing one of the great book series of our time and frankly allowing a work of such talent to go unfinished is just really sad
asoiaf,removed,ill say it i dont like grrm great author shit human being boo hoo youre fans keep bothering you about a book you said youd finish years ago and wildcards really yeah fuck you too george
asoiaf,removed,im not sure if getting twow would even bring me back at this point i dont think id be anywhere near as invested as i used to be if it were to come out its taken too long and at this glacial pace i would have no reason to suspect that even if we were to miraculously get twow that the series would be finished ados really would be just a dream first and unrelated to your comment i just have to say this it boggles my fucking mind how many people seem to sincerely even reflexively believe that george martin doesnt owe nobody nothin and aint our bitch or some such shit he doesnt owe me anything youre right but what about his publishers what about his editors did he not get massive advances for this books for real i dont know if he did get checks on the assumption theyd get some books at some date tbd then he isnt my bitch but youd think hed be theirs or does that not get included in the righteous calculus because reasons back on topic what sealed the deal for me was looking at georges age and health i know i know im a piece of shit true which still doesnt change the fact morbidly obese men dont tend to see old age hes theres no end in sight and if we assume we can take him at his word which shouldnt be worth much to anyone at this point if he does pass away before he finishes the series there will never be an ending because hes a spiteful cunt what other kind of person would swear to burn their notes explicitly so nobody else could finish the work not even robert jordan said shit like that and if hes so assblasted about someone else stepping on his legacy where was the indignation when the show dropped the bomb he left ticking once the show ends im done
asoiaf,removed,obtain pdfs of the books and ctrlf
asoiaf,removed,it really does give you one more giant heaping spoon of apathy cynicism and coldness every year that goes by the longer it takes the more those voices start becoming reasonable lol what this guy is an author not a martyr he doesnt owe you anything he is writing these books because its what he wants to do not what he is obligated to do just because you decided to read them doesnt mean you deserve to have them at any particular pace you can be frustrated but bitter what is wrong with you
asoiaf,removed,who the fuck cares at this point he is taking years between books ill wait to read it in years when hes done or when he dies at this point im done with the circlejerk he doesnt write he eats makes stupid jokes and does interviews do what got you to the dance you silly old fuck no one cares about anything else
asoiaf,removed,does that mean hes obliged to work on it day and night until were satisfied no but it would be nice if the lazy bastard would get off his fat ass stop bitching about how he needs a particular os and a particular word program and a particular finger and a particular phase of the moon and promises of lemon cakes whenever hes written more than three words at a time and actually do his fucking job
asoiaf,removed,apologists as if he has literally anything to apologize for
asoiaf,removed,a cowardly person who once behaved courageously is still a coward a lazy person who once behaved productively is still lazy grrm is lazy and the quality of what he does has gone downhill as well and its not his own preferences for how he works its a collection of outrageous requirements akin to a bowl full of mms none green he is the author of an immensely popular book series and has in the last decade written more for its adaptation than he has for the work itself he wrote more about a bunch of sad puppies than he has for his own work he wrote more about the fucking election than he has for his own work thats not doing his job i dont give a shit and im not entitled because i have absolutely no intention of buying books six seven or eight not least of which because he will die from the stress of being expected to use his one little finger on the keyboard long before book sevens manuscript is done grrm squandered his legacy book six will be a stepdown in quality and he will die the hbo show will capture the minds of people for a few more years but ultimately fade from the public eye and the few people left who care will wonder what could have happened if the man had stopped being such an entitled princess and just sat down every day and written
asoiaf,removed,i was there for all the missed predictions in the i was there for a signing in nyc area where less people attended that compared to a wheel of time signing id have to ask my mom for the picture since i couldnt fucking drive at that signing and now i am at some point the lack of update is disrespectful to the people like me morsexier doesnt like to wait morsexier is entitled and deserving of what he wants morsexiers mom cut the crusts off of his sandwiches why wont grrm cut the crusts off of morsexiers sandwiches
asoiaf,removed,its pretty sad and embarrassing at how he reacted to the election tbh like he needs to grow up its just as pathetic as these kids my age who couldnt go to school that next day because they were so emotionally distraught
asoiaf,removed,im tired of people defending him as if hes not an asshole on this particular subject the fact that hes spent so much time writing and editing other stuff like wild cards and other compilations while the hbo show was chasing him is pretty unacceptable to me one of the biggest middle fingers you can give the folks that read and waited for your books when you were a big fat nobody
asoiaf,removed,dont be a child why are people such entitled little babies these days
asoiaf,removed,every book takes longer than the last i bet the book does come out before he dies but he wont finish the series
asoiaf,removed,its crazy how much i dont come here anymore its still bookmarked first on the top of the page but like you said unless i see something interesting i dont even visit here anymore really such a fucking bummer
asoiaf,removed,stormlight archive or the dark tower
asoiaf,removed,dude fuck off we do not want that hbo spoiler shit here sieze this man mods
asoiaf,removed,when can we start saying that hes just lazy
asoiaf,removed,i agree the books are overall better i was talking more about the big moments like the red wedding mountain vs viper jon snows death hold the door the red wedding is actually what prompted me to read the books that event is the single most shocking thing ive ever seen on a fictional tv show imo i just stared blankly at the tv for a good minutes after the credits stopped rolling when i read it in the books i just felt like yup rob stark died again im curious to see how people react to hold the door in the books now that weve all experienced it on the show
asoiaf,removed,if you havent figured it out yet george is relishing in his celebrity he knows it will go away the moment he writes his books so why write them at all he can just peddle off all of his bullshit on all of you and youll accept it i dont and to be honest he has been writing shit for the last few years its showing and im over the obese dude acting like he is actually worth anything more than his current minutes
asoiaf,removed,he will likely die from health related issues long before he ever finishes the books
asoiaf,removed,the reality of creating something really cool is that it also creates stalkerish fanboys like you as a byproduct he doesnt owe you shit
asoiaf,removed,should i add captions in there for people like you i just want the man to fucking be honest with us if yes then just tell us youre done writing and be done with it
asoiaf,removed,ok what a crazy oversimplification youre almost implying that he doesnt want to finish the books if he could have delivered them by now he obviously would have but its also obvious how difficult its been for him youre also in denial to think you wouldnt have enjoyed the first books because of course we all did and now you want a refund on the price of the books how petty can you be listen you can talk about his collective responsibility i guess but the only people that grrm literally owes pages to are his publisher whos paying him for them
asoiaf,removed,holy shit what the fuck what an asshole
asoiaf,removed,how
asoiaf,removed,your an asshole
asoiaf,removed,god this makes a depressing amount of sense
asoiaf,removed,hasnt been a fantastic year for pretty much everyone the past month almost assuredly refers to trump
asoiaf,removed,for all we know he might be talking about his health or his shitty football team why would he be thankful for his publishers he hasnt published anything this year ffs
asoiaf,removed,he could be unhappy about the presidential election maybe he or someone close to him is having issues that they havent discussed i think its terrible to think that because a person is rich theyd have little to complain about
asoiaf,removed,hes probably just still butthurt from trump winning the election im pretty sure he wrote next to nothing the whole year
asoiaf,removed,grrm has made a lot of statements that are leftleaning so hes probably talking about trump
asoiaf,removed,yeah but with that wall the president plans to build between the pages grrm will never finish now
asoiaf,removed,it is untrue that povs are not powerful ned jon cersei jaime tyrion and cat are powerful jon is lord commander cersei is queen and so on grrm mixes up the povs very nicely however grrm picks the povs to serve as witnesses to the events for the audience i do think grrm gets in a bind with the technique once in while thus we get shortlived povs such as victorian barristan and damphair to serve as a witness to critical events
asoiaf,removed,in the words of hillary clinton this is painful and it will be for a long time a lot of people thought she was talking about the election results but now i can clearly see she was referring to the wait for twow stay strong everybody
asoiaf,removed,why has this been removed
asoiaf,removed,stop being rude about this guy posting about it think about what grrm said its been a hard year wtf has it no its been quite a good year grrm has seemed okay and now he is saying its a bad year unless hes letting stupid politics get him down hes better than that by bad year that obviously means hes done little to no writing i feel like this is a prep to get us ready for a disappointing new years post wow wow its like ok seeing grrm for the first time holy crap
asoiaf,removed,to solve the meereenese knot he has invented a new character called donalqhar trumpzo whose dastardly plot involves rebuilding the walls of astapor and yunkai and making dany pay for it
asoiaf,removed,although jon was dead for a while and he didnt seem to change much in the shows at least maybe hell be vengeful and merciless in the books
asoiaf,removed,unlikely the show and books are heavily pushing jon and daenerys not jon and arya maybe arya and jon wouldve happened at one point but it was definitely excised once the timeskip couldnt go through although i suspect it was changed after book
asoiaf,removed,the mongols were not centuries behind thats just you being a racist asshole and the point remains who is similar to the mongols the fucking dothrakhi the ironborn would suck dothraki horsedick before theyd get good land
asoiaf,removed,so now you admit they were centuries behind lets just be blunt here youre an idiot youre a lowlife piece of shit probably with subpar parents that reads shallow books and thinks your knowledgeable my point was and remains correct the ironborn are weak and pathetic like you and will suck horsedick before they accomplish anything like you so suck my asshole and maybe ill give you a chocolate surprise bitch just like your dad
asoiaf,removed,seriously he better be careful or someone is gonna pull a misery on him
asoiaf,removed,i already did dumbass the ironborn are centuries behind and would be destroyed just like that bloodrider couldnt even get into jorahs armor with his outdated weapon the late medieval saw longbows become useless as even heavy bows couldnt get through armor available to a soldier for less than a months wage go suck your dads dick bitch
asoiaf,removed,what a dumbass well you cant reason with those that didnt use reason to get into their current mindset in the first place i hope niggers rape your mother while your tied up dad watched lowlife
asoiaf,removed,is that what your dad calls his dick bitch
asoiaf,removed,make sure he doesnt die that is all
asoiaf,removed,being a total cunt
asoiaf,removed,thank you for your input ted cruz
asoiaf,removed,uh no how could he skinchange see you people dont even know what the words mean into a character that could mark him if they touched it just doesnt make sense stop trying to read so much into things—especially if you dont even understand how all that stuff even works i feel like i should be writing this in crayon for the show watchers so frustrating
asoiaf,removed,spoilers everything for a couple examples they dont even include young griff who we discover is one of the last living targaryens also jeyne pool is no longer involved and somehow they decided sansa is taking her place yet the books clearly have sansa still with baelish and she doesnt consider him a traitor like the show i understand its a different media and its impossible for them to include everything i know the books are too complicated for that i guess in the end i wish i had never watched the show but i may stop now not saying it isnt a great show just wish i had one asoiaf storyline in my head rather than two pretty different ones after tonight i realize now that things will be spoiled if i continue the show and looking back it was pretty stupid of me not to understand that pretty quickly
asoiaf,removed,the first time he came to a baltimore convention was to chase women durr misogyny
asoiaf,removed,what has dany goes to vaes dothrak and comes back with a horde jon wakes up and goes to winterfell bran has to escape hodor ww origin supposing this is canon what else is being spoiled from twow i literally cant think of any other character with spoiled content everyone else is too far from the books to mention or not caught up with the books yet
asoiaf,removed,dude wth this is an agot thread
asoiaf,removed,does grrm realize he will be remembered as the author who couldnt finish his own damn series before all of his other attributes i feel sorry for grrm he is entitled to enjoy his life but public perception of him is turning negative and frankly its his own fault we may never see ados because he spent so much time at conventions and so much working out the meereeneese knot a location meereen that no one gives a shit about he may have sacrificed ever finishing ados in order to expand on dorne and the ironborn ugh
asoiaf,removed,it sucks to live in baltimore but what does that have to do with asoiaf
asoiaf,removed,i recorded everything he said on my phone
asoiaf,removed,an online bookstore is probably the way to go i bought all the books released to date at the same time from an online bookstore for around € otherwise i suppose you could always borrow them at your local library if you dont mind reading on your computer or a pad of some sort there is also the possibility of buying them as ebooks which is usually a bit cheaper as a matter of fact the first hit when i googled a song of ice and fire ebook was a collection of pdffiles publicly available on google drive and free to download so there is that option not a very honorable way though not that grrm needs the money but i really think that he deserves it
asoiaf,removed,i wonder who he could have preston to service to help him with that
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,s test
asoiaf,removed,im honestly starting to think of leaving reddit altogether seeing how harsh some people are here arent we here primarily for community and enjoyment isnt there value in erring on the side of courtesy and patience
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit an rasoiaf user made a list of everything from the trailers that did not happen footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
asoiaf,removed,wow the originality is breathtaking you must be one of the guys who think that get hype is the funniest meme of all time besides im not waiting perfectly happy to let the show tell the ending which is of course the only one well ever get
asoiaf,removed,my predictions for the rest of the season the starks go to bear island and meet w lyanna mormont she support them but have very few men to spare as well davos comes across stannis old camp near longlake where shireen was sacrificed he finds the wooden stagfigure he made for her remnants of it or something he gets very pissed and confronts melisandre about it she admits doing it bran has a vision when he gets to the wall where he sees the last of the tower of joyscene we see ned and lyanna and we see a baby crying lyanna whispers to ned never gonna give you up never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you arya will be asked to kill some actress she refuses and the waif is given permission to kill arya arya kills the waif tommen kills himself jumps out of the red keep mountain kills septa unella shame qyburns birds kill pycelle bran saved by benjen stark bronn surprises podrick payne by strangling him
asoiaf,removed,sounds like youre just mad your shitty post got removed
asoiaf,removed,it is partially shallowness i believe he skoffs at the notion that of course a dwarf should be with a dwarf but its also that he meets penny in the darkest time in his life when he feels betrayed by shae and ashamed of his part in tyshas fate hes in no place to react normally to a womans interest we see this when penny tries to kiss him in the winds of winter chapter he thinks shes mocking him
asoiaf,removed,yes its a plot hole mel didnt mind about the other partys health when it was her king patently false given she refused to do it a third time also a plot hole when a character avoids doing something that is clearly rational for the sake of the plot thats a plot hole im afraid it is not a plothole surrounds contradictory events impossible occurrences or things that go against the storys set tone and logic jaime simply made a personal choice im afraid your repeated insistence that this is plothole is just straight wrong elsewise i could say neds refusal to arrest cersei is a plothole because like jaime and the wildfire the action taken by the character was in hindsight an illogical move but again that doesnt make it a plothole a plothole is not an action taken by a character just cause the reader says that action was stupid you are just wrong no the average bow cannot fire feet i love this part when someone doesnt even bother to google the subject to yds httpsenwikipediaorgwikienglishlongbow it has been suggested that a flight arrow of a professional archer of edward iiis time would reach yd yards is minimum listed heres a hint every single one of those numbers i listed exceeds feet except for the yards one which of course can actually hit yards which is feet please actually try to research the things you want to rubbish
asoiaf,removed,i ducking love this chit please tell me more as if i was one of sandra dees friends
asoiaf,removed,dunno can we call people fags
asoiaf,removed,way creepier im listening to audio book on my drive to and from work and at the part in dance when tyrion sees him in selhorys and he has a silver haired whore like years old on his lap
asoiaf,removed,jorah in oldtown curing his greyscale with sams help sweet mother of rhollor the leaks were real
asoiaf,removed,samwell pink mast tarly ftfy
asoiaf,removed,i still hope some part of the leaks isnt true i was holding out hope the leaks for the north were all bullshit but after having the north and dragonstone all correct ive given up hope that any of the leaked story was fake seems like it will be horrible and i honestly cant believe dd sunk this low ive defended them for years but of whats happening next season just seems so so bad im starting to wonder if grrm refused to share with them his end game im feeling empty inside
asoiaf,removed,people like to say affc and adwd are dull and boring an in some pov i concur mainly danys but you have to understand that these books are not the same tone of the first the progress they do are not only in plot but in character development sansa jaime sam daenerys theon omg when people say that affc and adwd are shit i just go wild affc and adwd are amazing
asoiaf,removed,we found the sjw lads
asoiaf,removed,grrm please
asoiaf,removed,lol
asoiaf,removed,what about faegon are we supposed to talk about him like hes the real deal and a big game changer in the following books ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show obviously his part is not that important this is where the books and show differ in my opinion aegon may not be important to the story as it is told in show but he is clearly important to the story as it is told in the books he might not last the whole series but grrm clearly has a plan for him unlike dan and david i mean s his story is currently tied to two of the seven kingdoms dorne and the stormlands he believes he has a claim to the throne which he means to act on with an army ten thousand strong there is no way his story in the books doesnt have an effect on the series if we were to dismiss everything that the show has cut or changed we would have to ignore most of the plot of the last two books the two media might have the same ending but the journey doesnt have to be the same which is the point of rpureasoiaf
asoiaf,removed,a stout masterofdisguise really lends itself to lord varys not littlefinger if littlefinger who is not stout knew about gendry roberts bastard and had any hand in his fate hed probably not still be rowing his little boat to who knows where lord varys would just be biding his time and trying to figure out if gendrys status as roberts bastard was of any use to him so keep on rowing or it was robert himself or someone else we dont even know about with so few episodes of the show left and who knows how many books left to be written before grrm croaks i just dont see gendry as all that important daenerys along with tyrion lannister the hand of the queen and her dothraki and unsullied armies yara and theon with a good chunk of the ironborn and ellaria sand and i guess those hideous sand snakes on behalf of dorne as well as lord varys are finally setting sail for westeros cersei had the tyrells in power murdered cersei had the high sparrow murdered and we can assume that the faith millitant died with him cerseis actions led to her last child tommen to commit suicide due to the death of his queen at his mothers hand stannis is dead jon snow is kingindanorf and sansa stark is the lady of winterfell and i believe wardeness of the north i believe that when arya stark returns to winterfell she will become the hand of the kingindanorf littlefinger rules over the eyrie until sweetrobin comes of age jaimes done with cerseis bullshit jaime bronn brienne pod are going to form some sort of alliance probably with the kinginthenorf with house giantsbane established with lord tormund giantsbane lady brienne giantsbane the badass lady lyanna mormont will play a great role the wheel turns maybe it breaks no one will sit the iron throne it wont matter anymore starks lannisters tyrells martells targaryens it wont matter this new generation wont be a bunch of petty pussies and theyll just join together and get shit done and rule like normal people who arent assholes and gendry will still be rowing his boat to nowhere until his arms fall off or he dies because really we dont need gendry but i totally want daenerys yara sansa lyanna to get married and of course brienne tormund maybe tormund will share brienne with jaime every so often if everyones up for it jon can marry arya even if theyre siblingcousins brans a tree theon has no penis who cares what those bitches in dorne do cersei dies because she has to tyrion will marry a beautiful lady who loves sex alcohol and knowing things as much as he does bronn will figure his shit out on his own littlefinger will die at sansas hand and sansa will marry sweetrobin off to some gross little frey troll as she takes control of the eyrie got was originally loosely based on the war of the roses henry tudor vii won that war by right of conquest in defeating richard iii at bosworth henry tudor viis granddaughter elizabeth i the child of henry viii and anne boleyn became one of the greatest monarchs that the world has ever known why cant got end with several great monarchs
asoiaf,removed,hmm vampire legends say that unless you invite a vampire no not the sparkly faggot type from twilight i mean the real blood sucking spawn of satan evil ones in they cant enter your home maybe something similar is at play other theories include that the girl was a barrowtown girl the maesters think so lord commander is actually a very powerful position wherin you can control the magic of the wall and even let otherswights in but it has been forgotten that is my tinfoil maybe i will elaborate on it later its still in the framing or that the whole thing is just a legend with a mere grain of truth the last theory seems more plausible to me so far there is no canonical explanation but the reddit theories are good and make a whole lot of sense
asoiaf,removed,rob is such a bitch and i think whoever wrote his script in the show is an idiot grrm even knows that
asoiaf,removed,the forsaken twow chapter shit had me shivering
asoiaf,removed,jon arryn planned to foster robert to stannis on dragonstone lysa didnt want to be separated from her child so this allowed littlefinger to convince her to poison her husband after jons death robert baratheon planned on fostering little robert to tywin but lysa had already fled with him to the eyrie
asoiaf,removed,what the hell are you on about
asoiaf,removed,um im not too sure i read it when it got posted to the sub but i think its been deleted try google
asoiaf,removed,theres more than one kind of beauty cersei reminds me of an porn star blonde with tits lyanna could be an entry to rohlympics pretty enough but super hot if you like athletes elia a model beautiful but delicate like a flower marge im not sure
asoiaf,removed,would you pm this plz
asoiaf,removed,i hate you so much you bloody cripple bastard and broken thing i always sort of imagined that the colors of the dragons had some significance to the impact they would have for certain charactershouses ie drogo has the couloring of the targ house and lead daenerys vanguard the personalitiesnature may also be the soul remnants of drogo warrior rhaego dependent and viserys rogue i really dont see anybody other than dany being a true dragonrider tbh personally i foresee a situation where the dragons battle among themselves until only one remains
asoiaf,removed,i know i will be insulted like i always am in the amazonian rain forests there are tribes of indians as yet untouched by civilisation who have developed more coherent arguments than yours i lean towards viserion having streaks of gold and rhaegal having streaks of bronze valid point
asoiaf,removed,this is the kind of shitpost to bring us through the long night
asoiaf,removed,asshole
asoiaf,removed,im sure ill get down voted but i swear to christ if hes writing anything other than twow than all i have to say is fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck you george fuuuuuuuuuuuck you
asoiaf,removed,i really want to believe that youre either too young to have sex or trolling because thats just about the worst attitude you can have towards a womans consent if youre getting into it with a girl and she refuses to look at you and is burying her face into a pillow that shouldnt say yes to you at all
asoiaf,removed,yep never giving him any indication that she was uncomfortable or didnt like it or wanting him to stop or ffs telling him no
asoiaf,removed,hah illiterate what does that word even mean
asoiaf,removed,she was so of course by todays standards did she give consent yes
asoiaf,removed,you have got to be a troll otherwise you are either extremely stupid or a terrible person what is she going to achieve by telling him no or trying to fight him off hes going to overpower her and do it anyway probably make it even more painful she is in a weak position she cant tell him no it is expected that she has sex with him thats how marriage contracts worked in this context that does not mean it was consensual and that does not mean it wasnt rape it was absolutely rape he comes in and does what he wants to her she cries and waits for it to be over how are you not understanding how this is rape
asoiaf,removed,so basically because she didnt do anything it wasnt a rape by that logic sansa wasnt raped by ramsay or real women who get coerced into sex with someone with influence arent raped seriously
asoiaf,removed,were not allowing the full transcript of the preview chapter to be posted at this time if you edit out that link reply to this and ill put your post back up thank you
asoiaf,removed,and if good ser that bar is lying on the bottom of the mariana trench is that still an accomplishment a standard or is it maybe a bare minimum to be considered a sentient creature sorry about that but for fucks sake saying you are better than att is like saying you are more politically correct than trump yeah you are probably right but it means less thabn nothing
asoiaf,removed,sansa is a woman and they shouldnt be in charge of anything
asoiaf,removed,house kardashia where bruce rules as both lord and lady
asoiaf,removed,to be fair we saw a water dancer fight in the mereen fighting pits and he honestly did very well it can be a very practical fighting style ned has never been to braavos and given his dislike of kl he probably wanted someone not from kl anyways strip did prove himself to be a very capable and loyal protector to arya
asoiaf,removed,and regular fire didnt even burn dany twice shitty regular fire
asoiaf,removed,lena headey is the one behind the boston bombing shes dedicated to method acting and needed some experience
asoiaf,removed,the mobility is a big part of it with only episodes left im hoping we dont waste time having dany do more conquering shes done plenty already she has a huge army powerful allies and dragons whos even left to stop her kings landing is in disarray and cersei has lost a lot of friends the lannister army is way too small to fight against dany i think the only real competition would be if john and cersei united their kingdoms and even then a quick flyover from dragons would incinerate the army i think the real threat will be the others and im hoping dany makes a smart alliance with john and lets the north stay independent
asoiaf,removed,well the flying bell leads me to believe no one in the proximity would survive the septs explosion
asoiaf,removed,aegons dragons are two hundred years old danys dragon is way younger years maximum older the dragon more powerful flame right now dany can barely burn a few ships wildfire act like mini nukes it is fire explosion and a liquid which spreads rapidly dany cannot pull a blackwater bay with her dragons
asoiaf,removed,may he rest in peace truly a fanastic portrayal of one of my favourite minor characters in the series he was a good man no he was a great man a maester of the citadel chained and sworn and sworn brother of the nights watch ever faithful when he was born they named him for a hero who had died too young but though he lived a long long time his own life was no less heroic no man was wiser or gentler or kinder at the wall a dozen lords commander came and went during his years of service but he was always there to counsel them he counseled kings as well he could have been a king himself but when they offered him the crown he told them they should give it to his younger brother how many men would do that he was the blood of the dragon but now his fire has gone out he was aemon targaryen and now his watch is ended
asoiaf,removed,is my favourite in the whole series
asoiaf,removed,aemons blind white eyes came open egg he said as the rain streamed down his cheeks egg i dreamed that i was old
asoiaf,removed,his name was aemon targaryean he came to us from kings landing a maester of the citadel chained and sworn and swornbrother of the nights watch ever faithful no man was wiser or gentler or kinder at the wall a dozen lordcommanders came and went during his years of service because he was always there to counsel them he was the blood of the dragon but now his fire has gone out and now his watch has ended
asoiaf,removed,in death we have a name his name was peter vaughan
asoiaf,removed,egg i dreamed i was old
asoiaf,removed,dont forget oberyn stealing the show for episodes
asoiaf,removed,his name was robert paulson
asoiaf,removed,his watch hasnt fully ended he will be staring at the backside of his coffin for evermore
asoiaf,removed,egg
asoiaf,removed,his name was peter vaughan
asoiaf,removed,who was she ah i could tell you everything about her who she was how we met the colour of her eyes and the shape of her nose i can see her right in front of me shes more real than you are you want to know the horrible truth i cant even remember what she looked like i only know that she was the one thing i ever wanted someone took her away from me and seven kingdoms couldnt fill the hole she left behind every time i watch these scenes my eyes fill up with the feels i guess it happens to all of us theres always the one who you remember but do take note on the contrast of these two the difference between spending your life blind and spending your life blind drunk rest in piece maester aemon you will be missed
asoiaf,removed,his death scene was a tear dropper egg i dreamed i was old the feels cant handle my feels
asoiaf,removed,in a way lancel is jaimes lancelot as well since jaimecersei is the true romance and lancel is the side dish
asoiaf,removed,fight club
asoiaf,removed,preemptive rip kirk douglas
asoiaf,removed,a true targaryn fire and blood
asoiaf,removed,title itself is a spoiler who played its dead in the show
asoiaf,removed,how crazy must it be to do a death scene when you are already so close to being dead
asoiaf,removed,this is false oberyn was a major presence in season he was absolutely not in episodes he was in the season premiere in the brothel he was in episode at the wedding he was in the episode where tywin asks him to join the counsel he was in the episode where cersei comes to talk to him about her daughter and then when the trial starts and then the trial and then when he volunteers to fight and then the trial by combat and thats all off the top of my head
asoiaf,removed,egg i dreamed that i was old
asoiaf,removed,his name is robert paulson
asoiaf,removed,dont forget that incredible deleted scene where he drops the clueless old guy act
asoiaf,removed,hope grrm manages the same
asoiaf,removed,he was blood of the dragon and now his watch has ended
asoiaf,removed,he had bitch tits
asoiaf,removed,k
asoiaf,removed,didnt appear yet tho so far he was only mentioned by egg
asoiaf,removed,his delivery of that line was great all the more poignant now knowing that was probably the last thing he ever said on screen after a long career
asoiaf,removed,he was the blood of the dragon
asoiaf,removed,egg i dreamed that i was old c and now his watch is ended
asoiaf,removed,snape kills dumbledore
asoiaf,removed,douchebag george creates show with great characters and casting kills them all
asoiaf,removed,his name was robert paulson
asoiaf,removed,what the fuck is asoiaf sounds fake and gay
asoiaf,removed,please dont be an insensitive prick who cares more about spoilers than honoring a death
asoiaf,removed,and now his scotch is blended
asoiaf,removed,i dreamed of you you were covered by the wings of a dragon as big as a field the dragon was dead but you were still alive rip
asoiaf,removed,balon trump egotistical maniac with small hands succeeding by telling his dumb followers stupid shit to win their support with weak plans and nationalist ideas a successful strong leader whos record is actually really disappointing and chalked full of failure grab the seven kingdoms by the puy
asoiaf,removed,is this a joke or are you retarded
asoiaf,removed,balon did not plan to hold the north but two castles this is an excerpt from race for iron throne who is much wellversed in these matters than i theres a reason why this fandom largely considers balon one of the worst strategists in the series race for the iron throne does not quote one line of the books when they make those awful tumblr posts im quoting the actual books theres a reason why this fandom largely considers balon one of the worst strategists in the series the fandom largely consists of insufferable stark fans of course their opinions arent going to be unbiased
asoiaf,removed,except that the lannisters were in a really horrible position that time in the story the westerlands and the crownlands were basically the only places taking commands from them at the time tywin lannister had complete command of the lands east of the green fork and south of the ruby ford he held men at harrenhal he wasnt in a horrible position robb cant take lannisport or casterly rock robb who is also the only other political actor that would allow the iron islands to be independent had defeated the westerlands army robb doesnt have the power to allow the iron islands to be independent and he hadnt defeated the lannister army tywin was still around with men if iron born had joined their strength to the starks they wouldve taken lannisport which would be ideal in terms of plunder westerlands have much more to offer than the bleak and vast north balon greyjoy doesnt want plunder read the book the lords are gone south with the pup those who remained behind are the cravens old men and green boys they will yield or fall one by one winterfell may defy us for a year but what of it the rest shall be ours forest and field and hall and we shall make the folk our thralls and salt wives he wants land he cant hold the west not only that but taking casterly rock wouldve probably lead to the same kind of consequences as we saw robb suffer when winterfell was taken casterly rock has never been taken and balons light infantry and the horse robb brought didnt even have the troop composition to do so tywin was trapped in harrenhal with robbs army to both sides if westerlands were taken by ironborn only the crownlands would be controlled by lannisters at which point their end is almost completely certain tywin wasnt trapped he had free reign to retreat south or even move north and engage boltonand balon greyjoy does not have the men to take the west
asoiaf,removed,hope you learned your lesson retard
asoiaf,removed,well there is a reading of it on youtube by ser jorah himself ian glen i had that on as i feel asleep last night the whole this is about hours long
asoiaf,removed,google the princess and the queen pdf and click on the first link
asoiaf,removed,so the cotf were pawn of the great other as well they created the others and fought them
asoiaf,removed,europe in
asoiaf,removed,oh hey its a salty book obsessed fan how do you do
asoiaf,removed,why does someone have to be behind him he seems to have taken advantage of cersei when he realized that he was never going to get a lordship from her i think he saw how many mistakes she was making with the tyrells braavos and the faith and decided to bail rather than risk being brought down with her it is also likely he realized that she was not as attracted to him as she initially was so may not have rose any further with her another thing he built dromonds for cersei yet we know from alayne ii in twow that he took only ships to his small kingdom in the stepstones who might have the rest i think you are confusing the number of decks with the number of ships and thats not half of it a new pirate king has set up on torturers deep the lord of the waters he styles himself this one has real warships threedeckers monstrous large you were wise not to come by sea he will probably sell his service to whoever he thinks will win and can offer him the most likely aegon as dany may have a fleet of her own
asoiaf,removed,oh my god even more preston jacobs i love this fandom but i just cant seriously engage with the bullshitting that this guy does so much of it is completely off the wall bordering on fanfiction and how many hours has this series of his gone on for how much does preston jacobs love the sound of his own voice that he can ramble this much about fringe interpretations of and predictions about a song of ice and fire
asoiaf,removed,jon makes tremendous deals okay the best hes gonna make so many deals
asoiaf,removed,not surprising anyone who ever thought they worked together probably cant read i have no idea how anyone could ever think that
asoiaf,removed,calling the series by its real name is hardly going above and beyond
asoiaf,removed,its just elio and linda voting with a bunch of throwaway account
asoiaf,removed,robert baratheon was picked specifically by jon arryn to become the face of the rebellion robert baratheon was the face of the rebellion after only the very first battle after he was the first man over the walls at gulltown and slew the enemy commander in single combat by then we knew that jon arryn had taken gulltown though robert was the first man to gain the wall and slew marq grafton with his own hand this baratheon is fearless i said he fights the way a king should fight jon arryn had nothing to do with why robert was leading the rebellion his exploits earned him his leadership and support jon arryn and ned stark did not follow roberts commands at any point during the war it was either split evenly among them in council or ned and robert followed jons overall command ned and robert were like you read a different book than i did considering ned says that robert commanded at the trident it was the kings voice that put an end to it the kings voice and twenty swords jon arryn had told them that a commander needs a good battlefield voice and robert had proved the truth of that on the trident he used that voice now stop this madness he boomed in the name of your king you also read a different book than i did because jon arryns vale forces were clearly on the left flank at the trident and not holding the centre where robert and ned were on the trident when their father fell wounded it was lyn who snatched up lady forlorn and slew the man whod cut him down whilst lyonel was carrying the old man back to the maesters in the rear lyn led his charge against the dornishmen threatening roberts left broke their lines to pieces and slew lewyn martell you also read a different book than i did because ned says that robert commanded him to attack the fleeing royalists after the trident you took a wound from rhaegar ned reminded him so when the targaryen host broke and ran you gave the pursuit into my hands the remnants of rhaegars army fled back to kings landing we followed aerys was in the red keep with several thousand loyalists i expected to find the gates closed to us robert was definitely in command over ned and jon arryn during the rebellion
asoiaf,removed,ehh you are kinda of reaching theres no proof that rhaegar loved lyanna
asoiaf,removed,your proof is a love struck prince im sorry but thats ridiculous ill say it again there are no proofs at all that there was a love relationship between r and l nor that rhaegar loved her or the other way all that you have is speculation butbut grrm said a love struck prince sorry thats open for interpretation its proof of nothing at all once he writes it down on his book and he doesnt change his mind about it and publishes it then its proof i dont even know why im having to explain such simple thing to someone
asoiaf,removed,are you dumb or just pretending first off i never said that there was proof that rhaegar raped her it was you who said that your facts were truer because you had proof in reality your proof is nothing more than speculation and you keep coming back here and saying things like its truth grrm said a prince struck with love he said it and im so certain it means rhaegar loved her how could it not be im sorry but thats ridiculous you are shaming yourself
asoiaf,removed,you should check out the leaked plot lol
asoiaf,removed,except they will most certainly have different points because he will introduce new beliefs powers characters etc etc in twow think about adwd faegon bloodraven new pov characters mels glamour power epilogue it is safe to say twow will have the same new revelations that we as of now cant predict but yes im sure some people will end up being right after all someone years ago correctly predicted hodors origin
asoiaf,removed,lyanna sandor olenna and edd sitcom make this fucking happen hbo i will fucking kill you if this doesnt i will slash your wrists and pour belach into the wounds before cauterizing them with a blowtorch and leaving you to die in agony
asoiaf,removed,it is going to be a bit of both in the previous book he had the arstan whitebeard reveal which people saw from a mile away and we learned that lysa killed jon arryn which some people have figured out and then we had joffrey hiring the catspaw and a surprise aegon invasion which no one saw coming and had no foreshadowing which is a long way of saying that some things will happen exactly like people expect and some will blow our minds lets not forget that before asos cersei hiring the catspaw was basically accepted as a fact kinda like rlj is now
asoiaf,removed,nothing compares to the red wedding and neds beheading also season had so many shocking twists and a gross cliffhanger after every episode prolly the best season ive ever watched on television on top of that the rw which was mindblowing
asoiaf,removed,season was really good from almost all perspectives except the most important one the writing meh dialogues plotlines and character motivations that make no sense looking at you arya cult of the badass gurl powa etc without taking the writing into account then i think season mightve been my favourite even though its kind of surreal to imagine a season without taking the writing into account lol anyway heres my ranking
asoiaf,removed,i must admit that my judgment of the show is heavily influenced by the books its an adaption and i rate it as such had some weird decisions that i couldnt agree with such as robb and cat not learning of bran and rickons death and jaime killing his cousin was back on track almost as good as had all those big moments but thats due to the source material as an adaption it was worse than danys plot felt disjointed and the wall story was awfully stretched in order to have the battle in episode which was probably a production necessity though as someone else here said is the point where the show became hollywood it became more actionoriented and i started to lose the suspense of disbelief with the characters behaving like they were in an action movie instead of a drama episode was a stab in the heart for all those who thought the book adaption was still at an level of accuracy it got worse in of yourse the adaption turned into an inspired by but i could live with that at that point worse was the lack of believable character development and the action movielike awesomebro writing i took more offense at how bronn dealt with the dornish outriders than with all the bad poosays in the world was slightly better but its just popcorn entertainment now ive become a casual watchers and dont care for the show as a fan anymore
asoiaf,removed,so you are mad that the show is sexist then when the show tries to give women some power you complain what that they are just doing it to try and appeal to people the waif hates arya because she comes in and acts like she owns the place and thinks she can do what she wants not because they are catty i dont ever remember yara raping the women she payed to have sex with her absolutely no rape happening then the dany shit you are mad that a culture that knows nothing but raping and pillaging threatens to rape her what the fuck is wrong with you then you say there is white savior bullshit and i lost my shit if i remember correctly which i do jorah and daario show up and and dany tells them to not do anything but bar the doors she saved herself and unless you are saying its white savior bullshit because shes white i have no idea what you are talking about lastly you say that sansa has no lasting effects from being raped did you not even watch the scene where she talks to littlefinger about living with being raped either you are the dumbest person ive ever had the displeasure of reading a post from or you made this post to make people mad either way fuck your post
asoiaf,removed,or donald trump
asoiaf,removed,king trump regent hillary master of war george w got would end in one season
asoiaf,removed,not robert the second tyrion said aerys the third you should get your quotes right also your theory is pure tinfoil
asoiaf,removed,twow is going to be the length of five normal books and theyre going to be denselypacked with the obscure details only a world builder of grrms caliber can impart what a gift how do you know this are you psychic or something can you tell me my weight next
asoiaf,removed,they killed him long ago leaf adwd leaf is over years old so when she speaks of long ago it seems unlikely to coincide with when benjen wouldve been killed i used to believe in this theory but now im lost and trying to find benjen again
asoiaf,removed,cool thanks for stopping by
asoiaf,removed,we desperately need a new book
asoiaf,removed,im on the verge of an aneurysm everytime i read barriston and targeryan or many other variations seriously you claim you like a fucking book saga which i asume you do since i dont think elias health is mentioned in the tv show and still cant get character names that are crucial to the story right on topic we dont have all the details yet on what really happened for all we know he could have been in love with lyanna and bobby b could have been abussive to lyanna that is more than enough for a fight to start if said fight is between people with armies well war is unavoidable elia was an arranged marriage there was no real love there and she was ever sickly and you are dealing with the whole profecy thing with a real mentality prophecies in planetos during the time of the events were serious business
asoiaf,removed,alright buddy
asoiaf,removed,yes i too enjoyed the first season of true detective
asoiaf,removed,you might have also missed your mom last night i didnt
asoiaf,removed,use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted fiddle around with a series no one gives two shits about until youre too old and fat to finish your magnum opus and then act pissy when people get angry that youll never finish your series while posting an unending series of cons and livejournal posts oh
asoiaf,removed,damn you sound like you havent read the books or if you did you certainly didnt understand them there would be no story at all if that hh tourney shit didnt go down its the main catalyst for current events and the author has left the details extremely vague on purpose so some of the simpler readers would be surprised about the truth of what transpired when the author decides to reveal it rhaegar was as smart and well read as the best maesters he was trained and practiced with a sword and lance to be on par with the finest fightersonly ever losing to either barristen or dayne and having defeated both of them too he was as good or better than any musician or singer and he was by far the best looking personman or woman in westeros as well as he earned the love and respect of the small folk who attended these tourneys hes the most talented and well rounded character and abel above all its comical to see someone harbor such real hate and disdain for a fictional character who was written to be adored by all save fat bob the cuckold who you seem to really like it seems you and blobby are similar both jealous as hell of rhaegar but youre real and thats where things get weird
asoiaf,removed,i thought i was baked but shit man you
asoiaf,removed,i dont agree with you about feast every pov was important to the overall story and i found it to be engaging and enriching as far as plot advancement character development and world building goes this is more evident in a combined read also martins urine cures cancer on contact and he may or may not be the embodiment of a living god feast is remarkably weaker than the first three books intelligent people can disagree but when your argument starts to be similar to explaining why godfather was the best of the trilogy it starts to reek of the stench of fanboy apologism also if your fourth book only really works years later when read together with your fifth book you are a shitty writer and terrible at story structure
asoiaf,removed,i get it almost all the fan favorites are left out for adwd but i did not read the story for those characters i was reading for the overall story and went in seeing every pov as important and loved every single bit of affc nah you love the series and wanted to love the book and were overwhelmed with the cognitive dissonance of reading a very mediocre novel following three very good ones so you decided the fourth must be good and the more you read it the more you decided that must be the case its not an uncommon pathology
asoiaf,removed,good job
asoiaf,removed,how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop the world may never know and those that claim to at this point are full of shit and highly speculative
asoiaf,removed,this is the sub for the books if youre such a staunch fanboy of the show go circlejerk over on rgameofthrones
asoiaf,removed,come on man get real
asoiaf,removed,but then how would i troll dipshit fanboys like you for downvotes
asoiaf,removed,shank two kniggas at once shank a knigga twice shields are for pussies shields aint actually for pussies
asoiaf,removed,nigga gotta eat
asoiaf,removed,duly noted
asoiaf,removed,i dont have the link but i do believe that there is a ssm that states the targaryens were the only dragon lords to escape the doom
asoiaf,removed,well then is there a sub for book readers who want to discuss both book and show this sub is shit way too many non book readers to have proper discussion
asoiaf,removed,yeah not everybody has rewatched every episode six times and read the books twice and checks the internet five times a day for new perspectives theories and insights i guess some people are just ignorant losers but this is a free ccountry so i guess its their right
asoiaf,removed,arya stark is tiny she may have good sword skills but remember in the show when she tries fighting the hound and cant even scratch him
asoiaf,removed,days ago outdated as this last season has been the biggest change in user base thats great but what is the point of this sub compared to the game of thrones sub without clearly defining this sub from got why not just merge them at this point pureasoiaf has a way better user base but without new material its use is somewhat limited i would like a place where i can critique the show without facing a circle jerk of ignorant show fans which has been more prevalent as this season has progressed not sure why the other posters comments were deleted as i showed more of a condescending nature you are promoting the idea that contrary opinions are not welcome
asoiaf,removed,technically chett didnt die during his prologue chapter so he already broke his must die rule
asoiaf,removed,yeah im getting sick of this sub that fact these horseshit book snob threads get upvoted is astounding
asoiaf,removed,why does he keep replying to these shit questions
asoiaf,removed,pm me your tits girl
asoiaf,removed,bwahahaa
asoiaf,removed,you should start making jokes but stop making negative nonjokes and then pleading its just a prank bro when people point out what you said is dumb
asoiaf,removed,you need to calm down who said anything about a change in motivation when i say they are the same basic character i am saying ther role in the story is the same both have sought out bran both are working with the children of the forest both are greenseerswizards and both likely have the same overarching goals what has been changed is the backstory book bloodravens backstory was as a targaryen bastard and hand of the king during the blackfyre rebellion show raven is years old and likely has some connection to the night king the blackfyre rebellions and the golden company arent relevant to the show so the show is probably cutting out that part of the character and replacing it with something to streamline our understanding of his current role in the northern storyline
asoiaf,removed,finish winds of winter you fat fuck sonofabitch jesus fucking christ
asoiaf,removed,thanks
asoiaf,removed,people gripe about the shows portrayal of stannis but honestly they did him some favors the show depicting him as not knowing about the incest before leaving the capital and only conducting the one magical assassination definitely take some of the edge off his early characterization
asoiaf,removed,wild cards suck fucking gonna be adapted into a sci fi series thats how you know they suck lame ass marveldc clone bullshit
asoiaf,removed,lord too fat to sit a chair and write getting pissed about people talking about him dying is like trump being upset about people calling him a bigot
asoiaf,removed,there are no sellsword companies in westeros there are sellswords free riders hedge knights but no war bands with command structure they dont exist in the seven kingdoms name one and tell me why stannis needs to purchase from across the narrow sea lannisters dont need to forage idiot and no one said they did you missed the point there why would tywin waste his breath on the vale the only reason it works with little finger is because hes married to their lords mom it doesnt prove he wasnt prepping for war just because some far fetched alliances werent attempted for all we know they could have been the golden company was founded by westerosi exiles the make up of a company would almost always include westerosi exiles including dornish and maesters the evidence is all their and youre failing to disprove it even with your capslock
asoiaf,removed,just kill me already
asoiaf,removed,haha downvote you all just watch elio and linda is going to finish the book for you that fat fuck can say he wont let anyone finish but he will be dead and the right is shared now between those three since they have collaborated in the lore book
asoiaf,removed,lool
asoiaf,removed,fuck him fuck him fuck him in the ass
asoiaf,removed,on the show it was joffrey
asoiaf,removed,ghiscari use low valyrian
asoiaf,removed,worst title ever who gives a fuck what number reread this is also why must your quotes by page im guessing every edition of the book has changed to page numbers not to mention ebook and audio book why not follow everyone elses example and cite the chapter by pov character followed by number
asoiaf,removed,reek reek dat nigga on fleek
asoiaf,removed,can not figure out how to make my own post but since its a relative stan is discussion ill bring it up so jon just died and stand is is going to fight the manderleys and freys hes been very interested in jon since meeting him and even more now the rhilor revived him now he supports him fully as lord maybe even king in the north
asoiaf,removed,you can find readings of most of them if not all of them on youtube wombiefergusons are pretty great
asoiaf,removed,there was a theory by fireeater over at westerosorg that marco rubio samwell tarly will shoot euron through the eye with a weirwood bow when he assaults oldtown
asoiaf,removed,i was going to vote but was lazy and did not think the votes would be counted already
asoiaf,removed,the donald trump of iron islands
asoiaf,removed,aah the obligatory look how different i am because i dont agree with the majority post
asoiaf,removed,i wont read twow until ados is confirmed to be finished im sorry im not getting more invested in a series i wont read the ending to twow is probably just getting add more mystery and raise more questions about the story im not going through this again once i know the final book has been handing in to his publishers then i will read twow and not a day before spoilers what spoilers lmao i watch the show and thats coming first say different story all you like but i can get by not reading twow at all as long as i have the show ados or bust
asoiaf,removed,that is because people believe their entertainers exist to serve only them in every way i have viewed this issue from two ways one you do what grrm has done and then come tell me how easy it is to do his job then you are qualified to make the assumptions people do all the time about him and the twow two damn it is just a book a great book series but only that my life happiness isnt based on when or if this book comes out if anyones is they need some good friends to realign their expectations because it isnt healthy to harbor so much anxiety and hate on a piece of entertainment stop being so damn whiny about it and just wait
asoiaf,removed,does he have to get married to sansa then since theyd both be fire crotches
asoiaf,removed,dude youre annoying
asoiaf,removed,okay then he is sure going to croak before releasing
asoiaf,removed,spoiler rule is stupid and this r should get rid of it if ur noob dont come to rasoiaf simple as fock
asoiaf,removed,is analysis of life exoectancy statistics for obese men against reddits policies i didnt see that part can you show it to me
asoiaf,removed,isnt it obvious because of spoilers this r is for deep discussion booksshow read the books watch the show before coming here to discuss it in another words this r is for seasoned asoiaf veterans
asoiaf,removed,sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,i think its more that martin is lazy and is prob taking the next month off to mourn carrie fischer
asoiaf,removed,or its taking so because grrm is just fucking about at this point and not writing anything honestly occams razor hes a slow ass writer and is far too busy enjoying the fruits of his success to bother putting any effort in you can do all the analysis you like but theyre a bit silly frankly thats the real reason
asoiaf,removed,i was going to pin that as unrealistic due to georges age but that would put him at so not too bad actually
asoiaf,removed,there is no good reason grrm is a shit planner with a poor work ethic
asoiaf,removed,is that the rule if so im not breaking it unless you think its distasteful for me to express concern to my obese father who is the same age as grrm im not making any judgements just noting that grrm is already two years older than terry pratchett when he died who was significantly more healthy physically
asoiaf,removed,chance he is alive in not saying to be mean but you dont see year old men at his size that often i am in the group that thinks the series is never going to be finished martin is a retired guy that writes on the side so it isnt really his job like other authors that write more than page a day a rate he is not even at his pace has slowed considerably and will only slow more as he ages i would feel
asoiaf,removed,sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,lol we seriously need another book
asoiaf,removed,a bit longer oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,whatever the case grrm himself has admitted to dragging ass and the self indulgent ramblings about award ceremonies and conventions arent helping either
asoiaf,removed,you probably wont ever get to read a dream of spring the final book the winds of winter will release sometime in the next years most likely
asoiaf,removed,okay thats the last straw fuck this sub this is getting so boring why do you guys do this to yourselves just leave it alone
asoiaf,removed,at this point the thing im looking forward to most with twow is thatll well stop seeing threads like these seriously give it a rest guys
asoiaf,removed,whats the base feast was published in and dance followed in oh are there only two books in the series he started in wrote game clash and storm in that year span its been years since then and weve gotten what is essentially one book he got stuck or bored or buried under the expectations he might be writing sure but clearly not a lot or you know hed be done and dude whining about a single downvote well two now youre welcome only makes you look like a big baby not a martyr
asoiaf,removed,lmao yall need some other books to read cuz over analyzing shit like this is driving yall mad 😂
asoiaf,removed,there is one more that wasnt included in the link httpimgurcompklcqmk
asoiaf,removed,because the mods are morons on this subreddit
asoiaf,removed,httpsgfycatcomfrighteningtautenglishpointer
asoiaf,removed,this is bad and you should feel bad
asoiaf,removed,one of those is already confirmed
asoiaf,removed,remindme hours deregister mums account on ipad
asoiaf,removed,pretty sure its one of those jokes that eventually people start to take seriously like trump
asoiaf,removed,this guy is a fucking retard from dumbville
asoiaf,removed,what kind of interview is that penis really lol
asoiaf,removed,its been out for days now and it was in the preview stop being a bitch
asoiaf,removed,note no one cares
asoiaf,removed,didnt read a single word looked like nonsense just came to say the typo in your title really bugs me
asoiaf,removed,dany is solid first season they lose the track on season they couldnt even understand the thing thematically season is good but from there forward there are problems it is not all the shows fault since danys arc in the last books is lets say messy they made changes and not all worked better a few great scenes ending season and what we have of season so far tyrion has minor errors here and there but all the way to the end of season it is a nice adaptation people may argue about leaving important things out of the last part of season season is actually an improvement from books since book tyrions part in the books there is lengthy and not really focused jorah has been done well for most of it they have removed small characters and given jorah some of their stories it works
asoiaf,removed,pycelle had a hand in poisoning not only jon arryn
asoiaf,removed,hey man you ok
asoiaf,removed,this comment contains outofscope spoilers to create a spoiler tag use this code s things happen to get this s things happen
asoiaf,removed,better then anything youve came up with
asoiaf,removed,theres a synopsis for the last three episodes but theres no source and they seem super fucking suspect so dont believe them until we get more confirmation than basically none at all
asoiaf,removed,is that a joke have you ever met an sjw there is nothing but outrage when a women is deemed weak
asoiaf,removed,how many times do we have to see the same room in the nights watch how many times do we have to see that high sparrow place the room we see at the nw is the dining hall weve been seeing that room consistently since season where else would they go to eat food that room where we always see the hs also seems to be an interrogation room because thats his thing this is honestly a pretty dumb complaint damn these characters for having consistency do you want the hs to give a speech while hes on the toilet and just look at the background like i said its small and empty compared to what you imagine a kings tourney should look like meanwhile look at the background for kl last week or daznaks pit in season or all the extras watching the play in braavos w arya or the wildlings at hardhome or dany leading the dothrakiyeah lots of extras i think you need to rewatch the older seasons sounds like youre blinded by nostalgia season
asoiaf,removed,dont use slurs here even if you intend it ironically if you edit your comment we can reapprove
asoiaf,removed,im not saying he lied you fucking cunt moron im asking whether you think it will be the same in the books
asoiaf,removed,theyll show him raping jewish homosexual baby koalas so you dont forget he is a bad guy
asoiaf,removed,fatness
asoiaf,removed,this is the dumbest fucking question ive ever heard they are separate universes why would either dd or grmm consider this of value to either of their projects thats like does cartoon april from teenage mutant ninja turtles ever miss being a real person like in the live action films
asoiaf,removed,no thats not what i said because i took your opinion into account and countered it like an actual discussion but you know what i dont feel like talking to a fucking idiot anymore so have fun
asoiaf,removed,im sorry its just i expect an intelligent level of discourse and find what looks like children replying to my posts although even children who read books like asoiaf should be able to have more comprehension than some of the people on this sub seem to have
asoiaf,removed,so what do you want for the mods to start deleting every spoilers everything tag that does not in fact contain information about everything and force people to resubmit sorry but have read the chapters and want to discuss it have watched the show do you want of people on this sub to limit their discussion in the appropriately tagged threads for your sake you chose the path of avoiding spoilers and you have to deal with the fact that youre in the minority tough titties on a breastplate maybe try rpureasoiaf stuff or wait for the big twow thread discussion when it happens
asoiaf,removed,ill take a golden shit right on your ugly fucking face its an idiotic theory it doesnt make sense its tacky and it sounds like something a year old would fucking write people need to get a grip that book needs to come out before we all end up as retarded as this guy out of desperation
asoiaf,removed,seems likely that well be getting some variation of that speech in the next episode of the show
asoiaf,removed,nazi
asoiaf,removed,youre literally the only person who needs this clarification
asoiaf,removed,quite the coincidence you finding it now though theres a chance this speech will be in the next got episode and its being talked about a lot at the moment do you watch the show
asoiaf,removed,read the books
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,until people here stop upvoting shit like that or the mods step in it will never stop
asoiaf,removed,sorry people read things differently than others do if only everyone thought the exact same we would need petty useless shit like your
asoiaf,removed,is english your first language i mean that seriously because if it is and you still dont get it
asoiaf,removed,hes such a lazy fuck
asoiaf,removed,im not being morbid on purpose but does this guy think hes never gonna die
asoiaf,removed,itll be out yesterday
asoiaf,removed,what a useless lazy fat fuck
asoiaf,removed,most of those are completely unknown right i mean there are theories but no dominant or even leading theory for any of them except maybe what pates after i was pretty convinced that radio westeros was right about until i started reading winterfell huit clos and now im up in the air again theres a leading candidate for but im not convinced
asoiaf,removed,lol nigga gon die
asoiaf,removed,its gotten past the point of funny anymore it is absolutely insulting the fuck does he do he is a fucking writer write the fucking book you fat piece of shit
asoiaf,removed,stupid bullshit football talk get writing you fuck
asoiaf,removed,forearms grrm needs to talk about the forearms
asoiaf,removed,rjaneela on
asoiaf,removed,i really want to nominate the post that was about aeron being the piss who was promised and provided textual evidence for the theory that aeron will kill euron by drowning him in urine but i cant find the post can anyone help
asoiaf,removed,danys chapters are just a roadblock in the story of characters that i actually care about i dont give a shit about dany until shes storming the beaches of westeros with dragons at her back until then her chapters might as well be about teaching isis goat herders how to love for all the story progressing they do
asoiaf,removed,you have ideas on how people should act i guess cool good for you
asoiaf,removed,and yet you were still in denial about it just a few months ago claiming jon wasnt rhaegar and lyannas son because timeline didnt fit because daenerys was their kid and because daenerys birth at dragonstone was too shady and obviously fake i guess it wasnt that clear after all and no it is not obvious to majority it still wasnt obvious to many people until they heard about it and sure as hell wasnt obvious to show watchers because when people read or watch a story they dont go on to suspect what they are told we are told ned is jons father and his mother is the mystery everyone is looking for someone to fit into neds love affair and thats not lyanna
asoiaf,removed,oh you were talking about show margery i am sorry but when they say all men are guilty of rape they loose all credibly of being a legitimate poltical group
asoiaf,removed,might as well name your kid dickless prat though considering all it took to get him to the point where we could like him
asoiaf,removed,i know third and second wave feminists kind of ruined your guys movement
asoiaf,removed,stannis can only have suspicion unless cersei confirmed it for him otherwise he can never know for sure sure there is robert is the king his word is law if he wants he can force joffrey to the wall he doesnt like him anyways and make tommen become a maester if he knew he wouldnt have worked to plant her in his way rather than just dancing around it moreover rather have edric legitimized and then control him rather than allow joffrey be named king he tells the truth more often than stannis does a false hope that stannis will eventually come to his senses and join the actual winning side rather than start a pointless fight besides expressing a belief that stannis and dorne will come around and join him when does he lie about his numbers why would he feign his ignorance to catelyn when never uses his ignorance to justify any of his actions moreover if he was just lying the entire time it makes no sense for him ask what if stanniss story is true in a sense of doubt stannis absolutely abandoned robert he discovered a dangerous secret surrounding robert that he believed killed the last hand yet instead of telling his king he goes off to pout on dragonstone for year leaving only after robert doesnt name him hand until robert has died and he is now conveniently king meanwhile stannis is also neglecting his duties on the small council and he proceeds to ignore summons from the hand asking him to return jon didnt tell robert because he died ned didnt also flee to pout about not getting a job moreover he held off in order to investigate the situation and maybe discover why jon was killed stannis already had his believe he only refrains in the sense because ned is more a man of mercy than duty with favoring sparing children over his duty to robert stannis later tells of following duty always appear to be doing whatever benefits stannis most
asoiaf,removed,house trump
asoiaf,removed,thats what you get for being a whore once you become one all choices are loselose situationsgirls dont be whores
asoiaf,removed,cool yea i was more thinking that because theres bits of his warging throughout the books and he doesnt really acknowledge it properly if like in the tv show he gets resurrected and them bam things are back to normal sort of will there be more of ghost and will he warg more and try to channel it that would be cool it was disappointing that ghost was barely in season though i think that was due to budget
asoiaf,removed,brienne isnt dead in the books or show
asoiaf,removed,oh stop that winds of winter is in its latter stages of writing if grrm died today i guarantee you that the novel would be published but hes not unless some horrific accident happens
asoiaf,removed,lets make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,then you obviously have no clue how writing works weve spent at least out of books to learn jons parentage so that makes far to important of a plot point to be nothing but some heartwarming moment it will effect everything in the story after its reveal and everyone will learn of it sure jon doesnt want the throne but what he wants is so much bigger hes the character that brings the kingdoms together to save the world and being rhaegars legit son is a big spet in doing just that
asoiaf,removed,i guessing you havent seen the feminists that try and attack conservative or libertarians speakers
asoiaf,removed,twow really cant come soon enough
asoiaf,removed,and if people want a completely unmoderated subreddit for discussion there is the free folk subreddit for some reason the mods here ban any mention of it
asoiaf,removed,book theories or predictions should not use show happenings as evidence in support or against that theory look im all in favor of the coexistence and necessity of both subs more and more as the years pass and the show surprasses the books so im sorry if i sound harsh but ive been bothered by this for some time that rule right there is what turns me off and im sure im not the only one theres a place and context for everything and show happenings shouldnt be the basis of any theory on your sub i agree on that but with all due respect burying the head in the sand and ignoring everything that ever happened on the show is just pointless denial to say the least as ive said show happenings shouldnt be the basis of any theory there but they sure as well should be allowed to in some sort of way strenght them even in minimally used as some sort of evidence or final argument for example and in all honestly when discussing and theorizing anything about melisandre theres no point in ignoring s the reveal in that melissandre is a glamoured old woman how about hodors name origin something that was confirmed by martin despite being show happening do you ignore pretend it never happened s shireens burning which dd confirmed is something that will happen to some sort in the book what about faegon are we supposed to talk about him like hes the real deal and a big game changer in the following books ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show obviously his part is not that important jeynes possible pregnancy s roberts strong and the gravedigger identities are we supposed to ignore all that and lets not even mention rlj in that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a certain theory theories about ashara daynes being jons mother are still accepted i mean for a proper discussion and theory every piece of avaliable information should be used try to minimize the showreferences sure go ahead but outright remove them is as ive said burying the head in the sand reminds me of when this sub decided to outright ban any discussion on the leaked episodes in season everybody saw them everybody knew what happened and yet people were discussing in the daily thread like everything was normal and episode might even bring us lady stoneheart
asoiaf,removed,wait a minute why do the mods here automatically remove any mention of other subreddits that they dont approve of im not even mentioning the name because every time i do my posts mysteriously disappear
asoiaf,removed,ballz deep in that bad poosy son
asoiaf,removed,dont answer himher this user is only intertested is repeating spoilers as personal predictions
asoiaf,removed,not only bran but big scenes with sansajon and sansalf the meereen crew meets a new red priestess jorah admits greyscale or maybe that picture is after dany walks away and daario keeps his mouth shut mel goes somewhere with jon arya goes deeper into the fm and theres a bloodys kingsmoot this episode is crazy loaded
asoiaf,removed,like an episode to remember seriously is alltimer that hard to figure out
asoiaf,removed,this comment contains spoilers after you cover them we can reapprove
asoiaf,removed,im going to cum simmons and company are in the know when it comes to got
asoiaf,removed,how about utilizing that ass backwards culture to invade another country does that make her a mad queen
asoiaf,removed,popular sports betting site bovada has been taking bets for game of thrones this season so i decided to post this weeks odds here if people find this interesting i will continue to do it each week if not my apologies quick explanation of how it works x refers to how much money you would earn on a bet of jorah is each week so a bet of would win you the lines change live as the betting influences the odds and they usually stop taking bets friday or saturday and then put them back on monday previous bets have included things like will the dothraki assist daeny or who will be on the throne at the end of the series if none of the characters listed in the dead pool die on the next episode previous bets roll over to the next week while new odds are created for new bettors the first dead pool bet to pay this year was roose bolton at i believe jorah has been the favorite to die each week with the exception of week when no bets were taken as the demise of allistor throne and olly seemed imminent anyways hopefully this sparks some interesting discussion i find jons odds this week particularly interesting as he has typically been sitting back with tyrion arya and daeny at around about how their odds compare to the consensus around the sub
asoiaf,removed,fuck westerosorg a bunch of soft weenies
asoiaf,removed,i really did think i was over hating these twobut then that derpfaced illiterate put his own worthless name above the motherfucking sigil of house targaryan arent these people supposed to have respect for martins work charlatans in the truest sense of the word
asoiaf,removed,hes better than the uptight jerk offs at westerosorg stupid unsupported tinfoil and all
asoiaf,removed,but if hes a bastard born in dorne doesnt that make him jon sand jon sand snek confirmed
asoiaf,removed,that would be retarded
asoiaf,removed,please cover the spoilers and we can reapprove
asoiaf,removed,an internet journalist does his best to write a clickbait title fails miserably
asoiaf,removed,linda is a bitch
asoiaf,removed,i dont think were going to find out about jon through brans time traveling unfortunately
asoiaf,removed,well cat is the one who brought him there so this pretty much confirms the lsh reveal this week
asoiaf,removed,hypocrite is a description of behaviour not an insult get over it
asoiaf,removed,even the dorne stuff doesnt bother me yes the dialogue is awful and the coup didnt really make a lot of sense avenge oberyn by killing his brother and nephew the guards at the water garden are really willing to let doran die but i think they were just eliminating the dorne arc as quickly as they could as long as the coup means they will be in the show less than last season i support it
asoiaf,removed,do you even know what charlatan means glad to know hbo greaseballs and your own ego are more important than westerosi tradition
asoiaf,removed,i think people give tyene too much shit for that line she is by far the hottest woman on the show obviously she doesnt know how to construct a sentence without sounding like a retard
asoiaf,removed,linda shits on basically everything about the show and dd her twitter rants make her sound like a petulant child who is no longer as special as she used to be
asoiaf,removed,or as areo hotah might say its hard out there for a chimp
asoiaf,removed,i hate you
asoiaf,removed,this is how i imagine a donald trump review of a game of thrones episode would sound
asoiaf,removed,nigga of course i dont decide whats on the show but im telling you right now that they would never show the rape of a person bleeding out you honestly seem a bit deranged at this point things done by book ramsay are irrelevant and while show ramsay may have fed an infant to his dogs they didnt show it did they
asoiaf,removed,you just went full retard
asoiaf,removed,hes just a sissy 😝
asoiaf,removed,this is my favorite passage from any book ever its a good little passage and youre entitled to your opinion but this opinion makes me think you desperately need to read more books
asoiaf,removed,can you type this all over again to where it is readable
asoiaf,removed,on her twitter yes and i dont see a problem with that she will say why she doesnt like the show and then will make a insulting joke insulting comedianrapper diss style she deserves that because of work in asoiaf fandom and popularising got and asoiaf all the time this subreddit is oversensitive snowflakes along with modssjw i doubt martin would like that he doesnt write book for children
asoiaf,removed,op needs to watch his damn mouth
asoiaf,removed,words are not interchangeable like that or else the english language would be gibberish which is what youve presented me with gibberish pronouns are pronouns nouns are nouns verbs are verbs youre literally just making things up
asoiaf,removed,that was not worth copy pasting
asoiaf,removed,it was stated like something was going to happen to her you know like when that phrase is normally used lol saying because she wants to have his baby isnt a reason its an out of nowhere guess lol but okkkayyy dude
asoiaf,removed,huurrr durrrr fuck dd right durrrrr for a story as immense and complex and almost unfilmable as this series is they are and have been doing a fantastic job of molding it into the television medium and juggling more main characters and plotlines then any other show before it and still doing it in a way that wont confuse casual show watchers
asoiaf,removed,man people on this sub really try to find any reason to bitch i cant believe you already have a copypasta ready to go against the ops comments this shit is hilarious haha
asoiaf,removed,just turn your brain off bro enjoy the popcorn ride did you see how cool it was when the pile of bodies formed sick af dude and the bolton surrounding the wildlings fucking a give me a high five broseph
asoiaf,removed,biggest fact is remmeber this is show only is that chick who loved ramsay kennel masters kid told sansa all about him other facts boltons killed her big bro robb bolton are known for flaying men ramsay was a bastard etc etc could go on but no reason to have a conversation with you as for the rest of your post holy shit you need help
asoiaf,removed,i bet you thought blackfishs demise was wellwritten too cuckatron
asoiaf,removed,there was a casting call for someone fitting her description
asoiaf,removed,speaking on behalf of a traumatized fictional year old this is bordering on riamverysmart material
asoiaf,removed,i dont think you know what the word sarcasm means
asoiaf,removed,lol maybe you need to use cop and paste to type three words but people that arent complete idiots can do it pretty easy slim
asoiaf,removed,oh for chrissakes you just watched a balls to the walls awesome episode and youre still finding ways to bitch about lazy writing jesus fucking christ will you just permit yourself even a tiny bit of joy
asoiaf,removed,about half of the comments in this thread could go in riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,mods can you do something with this asshole
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,you make a good point but i think we must accept this death was purely dramatic thats what i meant by character arcs snows idiotic blind rage fueled charge was evidence of this i remember something very similar in tolkien actually in the silmarillion maybe dd read the book too im sorry but with all due respect this is a bullshit excuse got has always been rather consistent and believable in terms of warfare no it hasnt even in this battle snows army allow themselves to become surrounded by shielded spearmen advancing in formation when they should see this coming from a smile away and just retreat back into the woods them the entire battle was portrayed for dramatic effect as was staniss before it stannis was supposed to be one if the best commanders of westeros yet he took his tired cold half strength army onto the field in open few of winterfell only to be ambushed wtf by ramseys much larger force on horseback because apparently he didnt send anyone to scout the castle wtf these just some of the rookie mistakes that commanders in got make all the time none of the got battles are realistic to anyone with historical military training or knowledge because theyre written by someone who isnt an expert and didnt consult one however at the end of the day its a gritty dark fantasy not a historical epic however vikings or the last ingdom dont have that excuse and shouldnt make such mistakes ramseys ridiculously accurate and powerful arrow shot annoyed me more than the idiotic battle tactics because it shows even more ignorance about the weapons and capabilities of the medieval period age but then maybe thats too much too expect from writers obviously but you really dont need strong storytelling gifts to shoot a battle properly watch gladiators intro even gladiators opening battle was inaccurate the romans broke formation just as they entered melee with the germans in which case why form up at all the cavalry charge through woods wouldve been completely ineffective equites were light melee cavalry with a weak charge who were best used to attack flanks and chase down or mop up broken forces also they were armed with gladius which was to short to be useful from horseback which is why the spatha was houses instead the real problem is that shooting a real battle with dozens of horses and hundredsthousands of extras is very complicated the logistics alone agreed replicating massive bitched battles onscreen is always problematic although much can be achieved using cgi nowadays however why even bother why not save such battles for key moments in the story and instead have lots of smaller skirmishes involving hundreds instead of thousands the battle at the wall was once just fight and it was just as entertaining even the white walker attack on hard home wouldve been just as frightening with a tenth of the combatants after all thats what actually happened historically large scale pitched battles were too expensive and hence rare smaller conflicts were much more commonplace the plot cast and budget of got lends itself much better to the latter anyway so you need to dumb down forget about your real wall of pikes forget about your arrow volleys because you only have one master archer and you cant afford to have an actor woundedetc to be fair some of this was done to highlight the difference between boltons armoured trained forces who are trained for open battle and the wildlings who are guerilla fighters the battle exaggerated the difference in tactics but got them broadly correct the real problem was jon snows lack of recognition for the weakness of his army and his inability to adapt his tactics to suit them
asoiaf,removed,dd could beat trump with that kind of cash
asoiaf,removed,wish the douchebag author would stop with her feminist interjections
asoiaf,removed,theon is a pretty sleazy guy but i sympathize with him your white knighting is unjustified
asoiaf,removed,for real hbo now at release time was driving me up the wall didnt start till i was already waiting for a torrent
asoiaf,removed,bewildered that she understands the fact that arrows have a travel time id be bewildered if a year old didnt know that
asoiaf,removed,perfect for the fuckers who loved this episode then
asoiaf,removed,the show is becoming shit and plot is being put to the side in favor of cool clang clang the future of got is shit writing to appeal to the dumb masses who dont care about anything besides hollywood tier battles
asoiaf,removed,god why are you arguing with me im stating an observation and used the word luxury because its something thats been left out as opposed to where it was included padding luxury addition whatever im not the one who cut it you dumbass not did i say that it deserved to be cut only that it looked like some other similar luxuriesdetailspadding that seems to have been cut in the past
asoiaf,removed,it is not a excuse for fuck sake he saw arrows coming to him and didnt even think of moving to the left or right just kept running in the same way i really cant understand how you guys can accept this scene as nothing more than an unbelievable cliché i bet that if somehow dumb and dumber had put fucking brienne there defending rickon by reflecting the arrows with her sword you guys would be bbbbbut its brienne ssshes a great fighter and well what im trying to say is these days it seems that people here care more about what look cool then about what makes sense
asoiaf,removed,ive never heard organ on his composition either but this track is unlike got songs weve heard it sounds sad and horrid i hope this one is used for tragic scene like sparrows and hs burnt alive or tommen scene im very excited too cant wait
asoiaf,removed,you smell like poop haha hahahahaha lmfao am i funny or what
asoiaf,removed,stop using spoiler tags improperly
asoiaf,removed,wait what did i say
asoiaf,removed,you sick bastard but okay i will upvote this before the mods come in and take it down for being loweffort content
asoiaf,removed,that sounds like an awful lot of supposition and smoke and mirrors from someone who doesnt really know what theyre talking about
asoiaf,removed,the trees are absolutely irrelevant to the images of dany and jon what kind of connection are you trying to draw whats the significance whats your point there is nothing original here
asoiaf,removed,lol people love this theory but its horseshit the show just hasnt set this up the harp at all if that situation you described happened of nonbook readers would go what the fuck is that harp supposed to mean theyve also pivoted away from important book artifacts like the horns of joramund and dragonbinder and the book about the life and death of dragons it might go down like that in the books but it would make for a terrible reveal on tv plus finding the harp doesnt prove he was a product of their union any more than him carrying longclaw proves hes a mormont also why would ned or anyone else hide an artifact inside a statue of his beloved sister why would he think jon or anyone would break it also seems like a very risky thing to do to leave proof lying around when he knew hed be taking robert down to visit lyannas crypt why would ned assume drunk ass robert wouldnt get handsy with the statue and knock it over plausibility problems galore also the spoiler megathread says the reveal doesnt go down like that if you dare to visit
asoiaf,removed,holy shit thank you this kid doesnt know english
asoiaf,removed,go fuck yourself you fucking kneelers you are worthless waste of space
asoiaf,removed,am
asoiaf,removed,so the correct word was actually usually al·ways adverb at all times on all occasions u·su·al·ly adverb under normal conditions generally words can be hard
asoiaf,removed,i dont think robert and lyanna ever knocked boots though theres no mention of it in the book or show while there are tons of rhaegarlyanna mentions i dont think robert would have kept it quiet if hed ever managed to sleep with lyanna and i dont think rhaegar would have ordered dayne to protect a baby that wasnt his
asoiaf,removed,make rasoiaf great again
asoiaf,removed,can you send it to me
asoiaf,removed,if i were him i would not its going to get nothing but people bitching and arguing with him no matter what he says
asoiaf,removed,ill say what i said last time lets go through all the reasons he cant be a baratheon first and foremost he would have had to have been roberts because renly was all of and stannis is a prude the last and only time robert is known to have seen lyanna is at the tourney at harrenhal that was several years before jon would have had to have been born so either lyanna was pregnant for several years she had a bottle of stag semen stashed away or jon grew up more slowly than sam jr in order to be passed off as being younger than robb upon returning to winterfell because remember that catelyn got pregnant just as the rebellion was beginning and robb was already several weeksmonths old when ned returned lyanna was pregnant for several months beforehand and that would make jon noticeably older than robb lyanna didnt even like robert she knew he already had a bastard daughter and she didnt want to become a lady who spent her days raising children and being subservient jon doesnt have pure black hair if you look at his hair when the light hits it its just very thick and dark brown brown he has no other baratheon features he is short and slight of build instead of tall with a broad chest he has grey eyes instead of blue he would have a stronger claim as rhaegars son than as roberts bastard as it would make him the last targaryen male as roberts bastard he would be behind edric storm an acknowledged bastard and mya stone who is older albeit a girl it would make no sense if he was a baratheon why hide it why not tell robert about him at which point he is legitimized and grows up in kings landing and perhaps stops robert from being a drunken asshole why have him grow up as a bastard in the north where catelyn insults him sansa ignores him and he constantly lives knowing he is less of a man than his trueborn brothers furthermore gendry had bluegrey eyes also called storm blue eyes jon still wouldnt have a claim because robert and lyanna werent married we dont even know if they were officially betrothed and grrm has even said that a year on planetos is lunar cycles similar to the hebrew calendar literally nothing about this theory would make any sense
asoiaf,removed,occams razor use it
asoiaf,removed,now you are just upset because your argument has been proven false your facade has fallen and you are being seen for the embellisher you are plenty of dissenting opinions on this sub do the work and find them to claim otherwise is just ignorant completely false and a disservice to those that have actually dared to tread the middle ground give them their credit
asoiaf,removed,we dont know if rhaegar and lyanna got married
asoiaf,removed,fyi if you are new to the sub i highly suggest you read and understand the spoiler tag policy for example your post is tagged no spoilers this means that any information about any aspect related to the show books games or graphic novels must be covered with a spoiler tag in other words no spoilers is the most restrictive policy in this sub several people who have responded may get a ban because they didnt use spoiler tags ujmsturm uacrusadera etc if someone reports these users before they come back and cover their response with a spoiler tag the mods will probably punish them if you dont care about spoiler tags then use the everything tag it means that the thread is open to discussion without the need for spoiler tags in other words the scope of a spoiler tag doesnt apply just to you as the original poster it applies to everyone in the thread
asoiaf,removed,frey will be the one to die all of them actually
asoiaf,removed,stop trying to create an argument you immature fuck
asoiaf,removed,yes this guy is a dck
asoiaf,removed,what did it say
asoiaf,removed,oh man i wanna know what it said
asoiaf,removed,i think she is both dim and cunning i think this writer is an asshat for wanting everything explained you havent been paying attention if you think got is going to lay everything out in front of you the fun of the story if picking up the clues yourself i think sansa was afraid that jon was going to bungle this battle which he did he wouldve gotten the knights of the vale killed had he been commanding them she was afraid to tell him that she spoke to lf then she was afraid to tell him she wrote to lf then she was afraid to tell him all those things and admit to not telling him earlier been caught in lies like that we all have a bit dumb but cunning as well arya is still an impulsive rash insolent child yeah shes been training how to fight but she backs down from every commitment she makes when it gets to the final test yeah there was some dumb writing but she is not logical people are not logical the whole point of this show is that these are real people who make dumb mistakes so quit hating on people trying to write themselves out of plot holes and go watch something where you dont have to do any thinking to understand what is going on i think a new season of gossip girl is starting soon
asoiaf,removed,i think its implied that ramsay liked raping her in the ass maybe her pussy was too loose for his tiny dick idk
asoiaf,removed,her conversation with little finger in moles town he made me do things things ladies are not supposed to talk about nut im sure brothel keepers know all about not direct quote just going from memory
asoiaf,removed,you guys need to get fucking lives do you enjoy the show or not just stop fucking watching it for christ sakes and continue circlejerking retarded theories of which are secret identity targaryen and poring over your cumstained copies of an above average genre fiction series
asoiaf,removed,sandsnakes also i bet
asoiaf,removed,i dont know im just not sure how you could read the books and not remember that its a pretty big part of rhaegars character wont happen on the show though it has never been mentioned im surprised they even brought coldhands in though
asoiaf,removed,sansa had the kov in her pocket troops of which we saw their heavy horse vangaurd plus whatever jon had scavenged up plus giants and direwolves there is no way ramsay fights this battle sansa gave up rickon she sacrificed the king in the north so that she could get her revenge since she knew that if jon had known the fact he had the way more massive army on his side he would have negotiated rickons release for ramsays life in black sansa couldnt have it no she needed to see ramsay suffer at her hands shes awful and a detriment to house stark and i hope arya kills her
asoiaf,removed,did i miss utartantyco getting even more mad about a tv show dangit
asoiaf,removed,what a fucking stupid thing to say there is a level of objectivity to fair criticism
asoiaf,removed,tommen dies 😂😂😂 yolo
asoiaf,removed,you think who exactly will declare him kitn between the red wedding and the massacre at winterfell surely the remaining number of stark loyalists is pretty damn low since this is a spoilers everything thread let me take the liberty to tell you that one of the less reliable leaked source mentioned that some one makes a great speech to say that they dont care that jon is a bastard and declare him king in the north i can totally see the destruction boltons brought up on entire north by siding with the south and kings landing they betrayed the great house of stark killed thousands of northern men and not to say how ramsay treated everyone else
asoiaf,removed,no it was the other guy
asoiaf,removed,to your first question yes to your second question probably not
asoiaf,removed,youre ok with weird women giving birth to demons spawn and dragons flying around but question it when direwolves grow fast
asoiaf,removed,haha thats laughable
asoiaf,removed,oh you sweet sweet child of summer
asoiaf,removed,hey mod you should leave this subreddit nice post btw
asoiaf,removed,baratheon branch of gendry oars is the fury rowing strong hear me row hear me oar as high as oar unbowed unbent unaware of where im going
asoiaf,removed,apparently house trump
asoiaf,removed,your off your fucking rocker if you didnt think botb was the best piece of pitch warfare ever shown on the screen that battle scene will change the way tv approaches similar scenes in the future in the same way the beach landings in saving private ryan did for film i will cut you some slack as far as writing goes but the geographychoreography of the battle was something that has never been done before on tv
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,same reason bernie bros thought that bernie was azor ahai sometimes you want so badly for something to be true because that you are willing to overlook all evidence to the contrary
asoiaf,removed,first time for me as well immediately my new favorite house words wish jeynes mom followed them more closely without her interference the alliance with the freys may well have worked out
asoiaf,removed,our servers are clean house clinton
asoiaf,removed,we coming for you nigga
asoiaf,removed,oars is the ferry
asoiaf,removed,just finished affc the sam chapter where he sees eurons eerie banner and hears tales of hundreds of longships raiding the shores and yadda yadda made me wonder what euron of house crowseye would make his words obviously the answer is lets go kill my niece and nephew obviously the answer is i am the storm and i decided that if that were a real thing those would probably be my favorite house words as it stands now there are way too many other great ones to even choose from
asoiaf,removed,house trump d
asoiaf,removed,haha it was a quentyn joke cause you said oh
asoiaf,removed,i dont like how everyone is a pirate
asoiaf,removed,if the video omitted this it doesnt change the fact that aerys also sent his own son to search for the mystery knight if the video omitted something then it never happened in the show rhaegar wasnt sent to look for the knight in the show
asoiaf,removed,she doesnt not sing her a song he sings a song when everyone is there and she happens to be mvoed by it nothing suggest they spoke or meet then next and he learned this how and when when narratively the best way would have been to have uncovered her as the kotlt next so the girl the same age as lyanna was or around it happens to be a excellent jouster and you dont think george rr martin didnt want you to draw parallels yh ok next lyanna described as half horse jamie jousting is about how good the rider is kotlt
asoiaf,removed,the whole point is to hide the hide her indentity since grrm doesnt want to make it tooo obvious its a clear misdirection since you take everything so literally i imagine you dont believe anything to do with patchface or house of the undying cause they didnt spell it out for you not to mention that better riders than lyanna like domeric and harwin you know this how did you stop clock their top speeds and did barristen not already say any knight can be defeated on any day so why is it hard to belive lyanna won when narratively she is the only choice or he just thought she was pretty you do know its a story right you do know its not chance anything happens so he asked lyanna and then what where is the narrative link as to why he jumped to her being his queen of love and beauty god i hate arguing with people like you the answer is literally staring you in the face but you argue just to be different go away
asoiaf,removed,well bran is obviously heavily based on celtic particularly irish paganism httpsenwikipediaorgwikibrendangivenname celtic pagans had druids which believed in natural things such as trees i know more about irish folklore than i do of others so my descriptions might be a bit biased the children of the forest are based off of irish fairies known as long story short these elflike beings had a great war with men only to be defeated and retreat underground where they dwell it is because of this war that they are all so hostile to humans such as leprechauns they are described as resembling beautiful humans while obviously not being human the others not the white walkers from the tv show have their appearance based off of the sidhe as well grrm said the others are not dead they are strange beautiful think oh the sidhe made of ice something like that a different sort of life inhuman elegant dangerous valyria is based off of rome even the doom is somewhat similar to rome it fell under its own weight except with magic the wall is based off of hadrians wall a wall created by the romans during their invasion of england to keep out the barbarians on the other side this was the edge of the known roman world at the time three headsthree eyed crow is based off of the third eye im not sure about the three heads but you seem to be looking for an answer for it the third eye is the unseen magical eye possessed by spiritual sorcerers in mythology you have two eyes which see what all others see but the third eye is the one that can see beyond it could be interpreted that the third head of the dragon is a magical mystical person as aegon was special amongst his two sisterwives as daenerys is special among jon viserys having walked in fire and whatnot not really mythology but kings landing is london effectively capital of the land where the king resides has access to the sea through the thames if i think of anymore ill update this post with it
asoiaf,removed,if you just strike out the valyrian part of this theory it still holds water i could see euron marrying cersei and victarion being the valonqar who will kill her as you said he owes euron a dead wife certain set leaks seem to point so something similar possibly happening as for the rest visiting texas doesnt make you a texan
asoiaf,removed,it just never mentions it and youre inventing it still happened though
asoiaf,removed,is a broken man one who is waiting for the next book more or less there are many sorts of broken men just as there are many sorts of birds some are soured by malice despising the gods and caring only for themselves but some are simple folk who merely wanted to enjoy the end of the story within a reasonable period of time yet the endless years are enough to break them all thought of the story is gone by then and books and old fat authors mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day or a skin of bad wine that might drown his vague longing for a few hours the broken man lives from day to day from meal to meal more beast than man
asoiaf,removed,i roll my eyes every time when i discuss the books with someone and they try to pass show canon as real canon
asoiaf,removed,another preston jacobs i just laugh at and refuse to take seriously to much intentional misinterpretations and cognitive dissonance to even try and take seriously
asoiaf,removed,you asked this inane question and you didnt even just pose the question but you had a whole write up on this foolishness what kind of answer did you expect ac exactly hrs and mins after the king broke his fast i dont want to risk the mods ire so ill just put it like this the game of thrones has been going since there has been a position of power to covet its funny how you think the game of thrones is this super specific term that only pertains to the iron throne it just means scheming for power and thats been going on forever
asoiaf,removed,when youre married to someone historically its not really considere rape like in modern times different standards
asoiaf,removed,thank you ive been looking for this not the shitty reddit help page which says barriston is available in the us paperback of adwd and links you to amazon like wtf lol

asoiaf,removed,ive seen it but spoilers you cock sucker
asoiaf,removed,ned is essentially politics without corruption hes akin to the good king or jfk or haile selassie he is a figment of a false dream he is bernie
asoiaf,removed,i get it but lee pace isnt pretty enough the loras casting had the same problem finn jones just doesnt have the twink factor rhaegar needs to be so hot that the harp thing doesnt seem weird
asoiaf,removed,the free folk dont follow your rules
asoiaf,removed,well as of right now hes king snow so he either keeps his bastard name takes the stark name or calls himself something else entirely like jon prancing jackanape
asoiaf,removed,i love how all the impatient nerds on here feel like they get to decide what he deserves to do with his time
asoiaf,removed,oh poor you george spent years thinking everyday about those books writing for days a year and yet poor poor you waiting for a book
asoiaf,removed,legit retarded
asoiaf,removed,i love the desperation some of you have regarding stannis survival d
asoiaf,removed,try telling poorquentyn but let me get some popcorn first
asoiaf,removed,it was keeping people that avoid production spoilers from taking part into any discussion on this subreddit fuck em
asoiaf,removed,why would you want to live there
asoiaf,removed,you seem like a pleasant person
asoiaf,removed,the entire topic should be removed it is one of the stupidest things ive read here
asoiaf,removed,im just saying the format is awful iv loved what ive read from him you seem to be a huge fan if you or him could just reformat the site in to something with even a frickin table of contents im sure he would be far more popular
asoiaf,removed,hed have had to of fought one of the kingsguard while injured or get a champion the kingsguard at the time had barristan who is a beast and jaime premaime who was pretty damn good himself
asoiaf,removed,actually you have the right to be defended by a champion of your choosing no you dont rikcard karstark didnt ask for it when robb caught him gared didnt when ned caught him and brandon didnt when he was caught committing treason while his father rickard stark was able to ask a trial to determine his guilt for his suspected treason tyrion is able to ask for trials by combat as his guilt is not confirmed in either case had he slit joffrreys throat at the wedding instead of being suspected of poisoning him he would have had no trial neds guilt was never in question like his brother brandon as he committed his treason infront of an audience the idea that anyone could walk up to the king and his royal family and knife them infront of witnesses and demand a trial is ludicrous trials are for only when the verdict is in question it was not with ned
asoiaf,removed,jesus christ you cant be serious
asoiaf,removed,i like her because shes hot
asoiaf,removed,obligatory grrm pls
asoiaf,removed,maester aemon would be rather disappointed
asoiaf,removed,did you even read the comment chain i am not the one who made the george pls comment some people gotta act like a smartass for no reason
asoiaf,removed,because not everything is an excuse to grind your axe
asoiaf,removed,judging by all the fire and blood im going to say that planetos is not a safe space youre reading a novel that includes graphic depictions of sexual violence and brutality and youre going to sharpshoot people for talking like people come on
asoiaf,removed,because nitpicking shit like this by alleging his choice of word has implied bias is incredibly stupid rational people realize that ops use of the word king implies the office of ruler of asshai in this context not that he believes the unknown ruler of a largely unknown land must be male push your political agenda somewhere else
asoiaf,removed,well we now know from the show that there is no great other just a man who was turned into a weapon by the children of the forest so we can assume that the lord of light is as false as any other westerosi religion
asoiaf,removed,is spelling really that difficult im sorry i cant help but being annoyed
asoiaf,removed,would bang
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,rasoiafcirclejerk is leaking
asoiaf,removed,almost still talking about currentyear
asoiaf,removed,id rather have donald trump direct that shit than him
asoiaf,removed,jon should rape ramsay before killing him
asoiaf,removed,i know cuz its all shit right its soooo stupid the show is nothing but a pile of shit steaming turd pile of shit even duck president has shit coming out of his mouth everything is sooo lame now and shitty who the fuck ever wanted to be entertained by action and drama hahaha sooo shitty and stupid all that retarded action and drama in an action fantasy action series unlike any other thats ever been produced on this scale what a steaming pile of shit i could write and direct better shit than that even though i have nothing to show for it shit shit shit shit shit yet im still going to watch it because i dont need something in my hectic life to enjoy and be able to discuss and appreciate and look forward t no fuck that what i need is something that i loathe and bitch about because i have preconceived notions built on the foundation of tin foil and if those predictions dont come to fruition i am going to bitch about how they absolutely butchered the show and it makes no sense while i dread the next episode and how they are going to ruin gurmies epic story which is now starting to get lame too because he is taking too long and that guy owes me a book god danmit dont i sound like a cynical ass hole
asoiaf,removed,i recommend going with bold or italicized words instead of all caps it helps avoiding sounding like a dick re macguffin is a particular shaggy dog story httpsenwikipediaorgwikimacguffin please provide a source please also provide a source for your contention that a macguffin cannot appear in a shaggy dog story otherwise i think you are making stuff up i am also not changing my position as you content i earlier said in the books its davoss journey to return rickon ive been pretty consistent davoss journey is the shaggy dog story rickon is the shaggy dog shaggydogg is grrms clue rickon wont become king of the north in the show they are going to kill rickon because he does not matter for endgame get ready its only two more days before all of the the rickon becomes king in the north theories get blown up and no one believes in them anymore glad to hear you are aware how martin writes i dont think shaggydogg is a throw away reference i think its a clue from a professional author well see and i like my chances
asoiaf,removed,i wish my problems were more like this instead i live paycheck to paycheck and taking care of my elderly mother but i love speculating also so i go that going for me
asoiaf,removed,people on this sub tend to be retarded

asoiaf,removed,shits fucked help ed
asoiaf,removed,he was faking it in a way to the loyal fans and the author of the fucking learning to be unbiased
asoiaf,removed,what the fuck is the point of this thread has aryas terrible writing caused to think dd are god writers because they managed to remember to correctly tell a joke without inconsistencys or is it you just are stupid and did not read anything on this that has covered the sub reddit
asoiaf,removed,play with his pussy ser pounce his other pussy margaery
asoiaf,removed,you ask idiotic questions i mean that as constructive criticism
asoiaf,removed,i would definitely be masturbating out of the windows of the red keep trying to time a hit on lannister patrols
asoiaf,removed,are you seriously so stupid that you think book will take another four years
asoiaf,removed,preston jacobs knows the books better than you do dolt hes completely ridiculous but at least hes original and always has valid points and criticisms its almost bullshit and he overthinks things way too hard but to say that his content is worthless is just a fucking dumb thing to say

asoiaf,removed,you got good arguments but the last paragraph was just retarded
asoiaf,removed,what the hell does that have to do with this director not recognizing he was paying homage to one of the most famous scenes in movie history
asoiaf,removed,it was released years after asos and years away from adwd it was missing dany jon and tyrion and the added povs were much less sympathetic than the ones that came before people were champing at the bit and expecting the exact same rollercoaster as asos and were left with character journeys with little action and unresolved cliff hangers i can understand why people were left annoyed by it but some of the hate it gets is over the top as its a great book and it only gets better
asoiaf,removed,my predictions davos visits shireens grave realizes what melisandre did and wants to kill her he confronts her but says now isnt the time to fight amongst one another smalljon urges ramsay to stay in winterfell where they have the defensive advantage but ramsay says he wants to make an example of jon snow and the iwldligns and they will meet them in the battlefield jon and his commanders argue about how to confront ramsays forces wildling leaders think there is no chance that they win jon goes to melisandre and says not to bring him back if he dies jon tries to fight ramsay in single combat who declines ramsay kills rickon with an arrow and spurs angry jon who charges with the wildlings toward the boltons arrows fly and kill lots of jons army then there is a cavalry clash tormund and group of wildlings get surrounded by smalljon and his forces smalljon chants who owns the north and challenges tormund the two face off one on one and tormund wins jons army is being pushed back and right when all hope looks to be lost littlefinger and the knights of the vale show up they swoop in and knock out a fair chunk of the bolton army jon and the wildlings attack with a second wind bolton forces are pushed back and ramsay retreats with what remains of his army into winterfell the knights of the vale jon and the wildlings kill all the remaining bolton men outside ramsay and a couple archers begin firing down on troops wun wun begins breaking down the door ramsay runs downstairs he breaks through the door and crouches to go inside jon urges the men to follow him inside wun wun spots ramsay and begins running toward him ramsay kills him with an arrow to the eye and wun wun falls just before ramsays feet jon sees and charges ramsay ramsay takes a shot at jon who deflects it with his sword jon and ramsay fight and jon disarms ramsay before beating him unconscious in mereen the masters are firing down on the city drogon flies over the ships and roarsspits fire but there are too many projectiles at once for him to do much dany goes and frees the other two to unleash hell on the masters and their ships one of the dragons is hit and injured when the ironborn show up and destroy the masters fleet masters soldiers arrive on shore and the unsullied and dothraki beat them back the masters are completely defeated after the battles littlefinger confronts sansa while jon meets with lords of the north lords of the north pronounce jon king manderly speech littlefinger says sansa promised him winterfell which she nods to but to keep it secret for the time being dany meets yara and theon who offer her their ships to sail across the sea
asoiaf,removed,heres the video that explains how the episode will layout the stark victory step by step including shots from the promo
asoiaf,removed,i loved reading feast and dance really loved them theons adwd chapters are the chunk of the series that ive reread the most the whole winterfell huis clos is so freaking good but the narrative ground to a nearhalt in those two books its not the end of the world but it stings a lot more today than it did in the summer of i dont get why so many people on this sub feel obligated to take such a hard line with these books hasnt georgie boy taught us all to embrace the grey in life
asoiaf,removed,he surviveshe will kill small jon umber
asoiaf,removed,no leaks yet
asoiaf,removed,you go to megathread genius he said plstell me
asoiaf,removed,megathread alert
asoiaf,removed,its also the season with hardhome one of the best episodes of a show that ive ever seen jesus christ put your hard on away it was just a battle scene
asoiaf,removed,i read a spoiler that is pretty concrete on what rickons fate will be but this is got so anything is possible
asoiaf,removed,right this entire thread reads like a parody probably because rasoiafcirclejerk is a parody of this sub dipshit this comment says something about the sort of people that go there
asoiaf,removed,or do you equate any woman in position of authority with asha yes because i totally equate characters like olenna cersei dany etc with asha i mean theyre women in positions of authority right no also i think you need to reread the book because you dont seem to have a clue what youre talking about aerion brightflame shouldve fucked her up instead of the innocent tanselle
asoiaf,removed,megathread alert
asoiaf,removed,it all started with jon snows death pretty sure they agreed to push that hes really really truly dead in one interview they put in an editors note saying that kit cut his hair right after they were finished talking for exclusive coverage no one pun intended got screeners this year cause of the leaks last season but they still manage to see every week early
asoiaf,removed,you need to work on your reading comprehension
asoiaf,removed,too long
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,yeah im totally oblivious why it would hurt to kick a lady between the legs jackass
asoiaf,removed,run rickon run
asoiaf,removed,he wont you want to play gameslittle man ok run to your brother i shoot arrows once youre near him ill hit you die in his arms
asoiaf,removed,need some spoiler tags for adwd this is spoilers affc
asoiaf,removed,do you have a disorder
asoiaf,removed,he will dietormund will kill small jon umber army of vale arrivedwunwun gets an arrow to the eye die 👍🏻👈🏻
asoiaf,removed,why is it a flagrant you think its going to happen 😂
asoiaf,removed,hey sorry missed the spoilers tag at the top i think ive covered everything thats from adwd now
asoiaf,removed,grrm can go fuck himself for all i care not buying the book whenever it comes out the show is the books now
asoiaf,removed,write the got books you fat fucking cunt
asoiaf,removed,twow jon xxxvii jon saw a hot chick who was so totally italian or maybe some kinda spanish so he stabbed her to forge lightbringer and drank his bud light in peace for once jon cummed that day pale white as milk his seed dawned on her belly he would not make a bastard of his own
asoiaf,removed,the dornish plot was fucked from the start for cutting arianne and quentyn then focusing on the sand snakes and also making the sand snakes retarded
asoiaf,removed,this quote is highly relevant given the current political climate in america wide spread ignorance gives me and many other intelligent people a sense of hopelessness honestly there is a war on knowledge in this country
asoiaf,removed,arrest robert for high crimes and treason aganist house targeryan charges ned is guilty of as well lmfao no but seriously i do hope you realize how dumb this sounds
asoiaf,removed,you basically just described donald trump yet he has millions of fervent followers euron is alpha as fuck and he proved it with chests full of gold and plunder from valyria no one cares hes a dick actually on the iron islands thats a huge plus basically euron is pre wwii hitler inspiring world domination to his beaten down and humiliated countrymen like germany after wwi and like germany some think him a madman but most are ready to believe anything as long as theyre promised conquest and glory so he definitely has the people behind him and fervent supporters who believe the end justifies the means and finally thematically euron has been set up now as the big bad for the final act of asoiaf tywin was the ramsey was the and euron will be the biggest and baddest of them all
asoiaf,removed,euron has a suit of valryian steel armor in the newest twow chapter so its pretty safe to say he went to valyria
asoiaf,removed,the fact is thats the correct pronunciation and anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot the guy who created it said so and come on its the intuitive way to say it
asoiaf,removed,the books are great because tons of things are out there to be caught by clever readers had i not watched the show i would have never known renly is gay for example the show is very overthetop about him and loras the books are far more subtle and renlyloras being gay is one of the more overt parts its why people will read the books at least twice over and start figuring things grrm loves being subtle my best piece of advice is to take them slow and keep some characters in mind the number of named characters is considerably larger in the books than in the show by adwd on my first readthrough i couldnt tell the difference between most of the characters in mereen with dany because they all have foreign confusing names
asoiaf,removed,fucks sake here we go again with tyrion being a targaryen stop projecting this fan fiction nonsense the season spoilers pretty much killed this stupid theory dragon riders right dany jon and the nights king there let it go hes not a dragon rider and certainly not a targaryen
asoiaf,removed,hey mods serious question i got downvoted to oblivion for questioning why a post marked no spoilers was marked as much despite the fact that it was a post about danys dragons can we get rid of that absolutely ridiculously vague general knowledge caveat to spoilers if the last line of a book doesnt count as a spoiler why do we even have spoilers agot as a tag thats the exact time when it should be used
asoiaf,removed,shame on you guys reddit is really the home of stupid theories
asoiaf,removed,this comment was removed for outofscope spoilers please feel free to repost in an appropriate spoiler scope such as spoilers published or spoilers main thanks
asoiaf,removed,there was reportedly a pretty full leak of the season summary and major plot points i read it no ragrets
asoiaf,removed,riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,wait youre only here in the book discussion subreddit cause of the show why arent you off in rgot
asoiaf,removed,b r a v g e o r g e
asoiaf,removed,b r a v g e o r g e
asoiaf,removed,did i tell show watchers to leave i said if you are here only because of the show that is strange or implied rather my exact words wait youre only here in the book discussion subreddit cause of the show why arent you off in rgot because his statement implied he was only here because of the show i was curious why he preferred a subreddit that largely discusses the books as well if he is only a fan of the show you people seem to jump to conclusions and get all mad whenever the show is even questioned so how about please dont try to put words in my mouth and actually read what i say before saying i broke rules that i clearly didnt
asoiaf,removed,really delete all my shit rather than respond i guess all the people insulting me are just aok
asoiaf,removed,wowi dont think ive seen one person on this sub deny grrm any credit is rasoiafcirclejerk leaking or are you new to the sub
asoiaf,removed,cersei is beyond retarded there is no question about that you can write a thesis on how stupid she is everything from her idiotic assassination of robertgetting your husband drunk and hoping that boar kills him how stupid can you get to murdering her friend because of a prophecy to giving the high sparrow an armed faith militant and thinking you got the better end of the deal to filling her small council licksplittles and fools that abandon her at first opportunity i dont understand how anybody can earnestly believe that cersei isnt an idiot
asoiaf,removed,pretender
asoiaf,removed,yes but there are lots of rumors out there that euron got some tricks in his backpack production spoiler do not read if you dont want to be spoiled from leaked photos it seems likely that atleast euron cercei and randell tarly get a good fight against daenerys
asoiaf,removed,points upvoted too old
asoiaf,removed,actually reports say they will be known characters not fan favorites not even necessarily wellknown
asoiaf,removed,yup thanks for doing that gonna delete these in a few minutes
asoiaf,removed,another one who doesnt have any reading comprehension you must be a show only watcher because they are coming in flocks during the last couple months
asoiaf,removed,im so glad that grrm disagrees with you go watch the show if you dont like reading the details the details are the best part
asoiaf,removed,is there any way you could message me a link to that ebook i hope that doesnt violate the piracy rules
asoiaf,removed,desand your vagina
asoiaf,removed,loses an argument must be trolling unfortunately rohanne webber is a fictional character watching someone trying to be a white knight to a fictional character is quite amusing
asoiaf,removed,this is retarded
asoiaf,removed,thats a lazy comment for sure
asoiaf,removed,i dont know the exact amount the actors are being paid maybe someone could reply with that info maybe you could get off your lazy ass and find out before you go all social justice warrior or maybe you can take this over to rgameofthrones and find someone who gives a shit
asoiaf,removed,retard
asoiaf,removed,nope its because were not trolls trying to waste everyones time
asoiaf,removed,what does the bastard ramsey snow and isis have in common isis needs to run out of women before they fuck their animals
asoiaf,removed,how old are you
asoiaf,removed,next thread hey guys i think i just figured out something no one has considered rlj and heres the proof
asoiaf,removed,i realized that those users are a bunch of neckbeards who wants to honor their mlady
asoiaf,removed,this interview brought to you by hillary clintons pay masters
asoiaf,removed,season complete disaster without hardhome hyperbole and blowing things out of proportion thats what all the sub is now nitpicking and whining and tinfoiling
asoiaf,removed,it fit perfectly they constructed some great scenes in the early seasons also really enjoyed the dynamic between arya and tywin in season i think that would have been great in the books too
asoiaf,removed,this is an argument that i find really stupid what you are basically saying is nothing changes over time a continent cant exist in piece if it is not ruled by a single individule do you understand how idiotic both those statements are
asoiaf,removed,imwithher
asoiaf,removed,because it got spoilt
asoiaf,removed,i dont know how else to tell you
asoiaf,removed,that was a legitimate question
asoiaf,removed,rgameofthrones
asoiaf,removed,couldnt stop myself from making this shouldve tried harder
asoiaf,removed,youre retahded
asoiaf,removed,thats how bostonians say retarded
asoiaf,removed,yup this theory is just dumb
asoiaf,removed,youre going to seriously apologize for dd and criticize grrm you know theres an entire track record laid before you about what they have written so far and what he has written just look at it see the difference in quality yeahbut okay your post makes perfect sense rolls eyes
asoiaf,removed,how does any of that excuse the bad writing of aryas storyline it doesnt stop mindlessly defending the show im a big fan of it and think its great overall but anyone who steps up to try to defend that storyline is a blind fanboy plain and simple
asoiaf,removed,i see him as a westerosi bertie wooster acok takes on a new light when you imagine wooster being made prime minister by his dadand then finding hes good at it
asoiaf,removed,you just claimed a metaphor means something literally youre shit at geeking
asoiaf,removed,i hope melisandre has more scenes id love to see more of bewbs ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
asoiaf,removed,bad writing is bad writing no ifs ands or buts aryas storyline was terribly written and badly filmed write excuses all you want but her story from episodes and was bad do you disagree yes no everything you typed here is apologetic and doesnt actually speak to the quality of the writing about her character in those episodes keep on hating on grrm without him this show would never exist dd couldnt come up with anything even remotely close the brilliance of this series on their own if they could they would they cant stop hating on grrm if youre that pissed stop supporting him
asoiaf,removed,whoring drinking and managing cisterns
asoiaf,removed,i think ramsays hounds will turn on him
asoiaf,removed,nah either figure of speech or metaphor work youre still shit at geeking ps your edit is loser level stuff try typing fewer
asoiaf,removed,i could see the theory of jon offering a to end the massacre and ramsay accepting happening but i really would prefer them dueling in the middle of the battle robert vs rhaegar style
asoiaf,removed,i think the scene from the show where jaimie has to go fetch him from the brothel kind of sums it up pretty well we do know that he made the shit flow to the sea in casterly rock as the lord of sewers or something
asoiaf,removed,those who cant do teach is the most fundamentally wrong headed stupid ignorant truism there is out there
asoiaf,removed,listen fam which is the biggest number or on the internet we are one one family with one purpose i live in canada and theres no hbo go and due to that fact i pirate my episodes cause hbo doesnt want my money
asoiaf,removed,wasnt he in control of the sewers of casterly rock all the shit found its way to the sea the pipes never ran cleaner
asoiaf,removed,but where do whores go
asoiaf,removed,httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikitwow
asoiaf,removed,in ac when he became a man at sixteen he wanted to take a tour of the nine free cities as his uncles gerion and tygett had done tywin forbade him to go and instead gave him charge of all the cisterns and drains at casterly rock when tyrion was eighteen his uncle gerion left on a journey for valyria to recover the ancient valyrian steel blade brightroar which had once belonged to house lannister lord tywin forbade tyrion to go in this journey as well when cersei married king robert i baratheon in ac tyrion came to kings landing for the wedding where he sought out the dragon skulls which had decorated the throne room during the targaryen reigns but which had been taken down by robert for his twentythird birthday tyrion received a mare from his brother jaime
asoiaf,removed,you sure germany wouldnt be koran or something
asoiaf,removed,i hate when people read spoiler threads and then so blatantly act like its something theyre just theorizing
asoiaf,removed,do you look at a stop sign and see go
asoiaf,removed,yall are like the guy after hitler saying im not shaving this mustache just because that guy ruined it
asoiaf,removed,i have a feeling its just going to be one stupid little arrow that takes him out though
asoiaf,removed,yes i know who they are two people who are a complete joke
asoiaf,removed,daenerys gets some pretty amazing dresses as well with a lot of little details as minimal as it is her white dress with the dragon neckpiece in the fighting pits was my favorite of hers although of all the outfits i think cerseis darthcersei outfit is probably my favorite of all
asoiaf,removed,so youre a troll got it
asoiaf,removed,margs joffrey wedding dress is another good one
asoiaf,removed,dont blame me for your inabilities science in planetos doesnt work as it does in real life but instead works how george believes even if paternal age does not have an effect on the health of a child in our world george likely believes it does which means that is the case in asoiaf
asoiaf,removed,you should have spent those couple of hours just reading the book he brings it up later
asoiaf,removed,you are going to struggle mightily to pick up on hints during this series
asoiaf,removed,honestly this is just dumb its just saying that the wall and the nights watch should be able to protect them nothing more he killed jon to get him out of the nights watch the nights watch is already a depleted organization that will offer no protection from the others if the wall comes down they could have hearts of solid gold and never have killed either of their commanders and it would be just as irrelevant to their ability to guard westeros as if theyd begun to randomly murder each other i mean honestly this post is just soooooo dumb but theres no show airing and no book or chapter out to discuss so carry on
asoiaf,removed,i dont really think so the three eyed raven is obviously aware of the mark and its properties but has bran escape the cave anyway thats an odd choice if bran is a walking barrier breaker
asoiaf,removed,aww yes the infamous but youve never wrote a book so you cant criticize defence very persuasive
asoiaf,removed,degenerates that flood the board with pointless threads maybe you should be thinking hm am i typing something rude
asoiaf,removed,hm am i typing something dumb cough cough cough theres never any reason to be disrespectful and rude to someone who has not treated you poorly
asoiaf,removed,the hairy mousepig as big as a cow is obviously ops mom heyyo
asoiaf,removed,its definitely not anything close to related to how much effort it takes him so much as having the prerequisite conditions to do his mumbojumbo we dont know if the night kings mark is a persistent effect or if it gets burned when you use it or if the mark for the childrens enclave is even compatible to the magic in the wall it may be specifically attuned to brs weirwood node rather than bran himself we know pretty much nothing of how the spell actually works
asoiaf,removed,it only spoiled hodor jon others origin and what else im positive that twow will be out before and im also weirdly sure that the book is gonna be very different show is stupid and the stupidity increases
asoiaf,removed,tinfoil or did you read the leaks
asoiaf,removed,please do not be to harsh on me as this is my first post not a grammaticallogical abomination please go easy on me this is my first post haha not great but not an full on abomination just a thought dont be too hard on me haha this is my first post such a vile abomination that it is the literary equivalent of molesting the mother above in full view of god men and the most devout upon the very steps of baelors sept shame shame shame
asoiaf,removed,fewer
asoiaf,removed,the actor for aemon targaryen peter vaughn i tried to post a tribute to him in rtelevision but the mods decided that a clinical article about his death was plenty so posting his best scene was offensive
asoiaf,removed,to be fair some of this is just opinion on my reread of affc when i wasnt racing to find out what happened to all the chars from the end of book i really enjoyed cerseis chapters and the half of briennes the first half was still a bit slow for me i think the book is a pretty good book which is held back by issues with the way that grrm chose to end the book with so many major character climaxes and not follow up on them in the the book is probably the weakest in the series imo but still was better on the reread as well im not arguing with the book being the best its very hard to argue with that but i also think the and get a bad reputation for what is really a pacing issue across the series and not a problem with the individual books themselves
asoiaf,removed,no dumbass he was in he was already the king of fantasy the american tolkien long before the show was even imagined
asoiaf,removed,this sub is stooping to new lows lately

asoiaf,removed,are you seriously suggesting that bond or bourne isnt absolutely unbelievable lol clearly we have significantly different perceptions of reality both are examples of the same level of completely unrealistic injury recoveryphysical prowessetc in every other instance of the show being gutted twice would absolutely have either killed or seriously maimed a person but were expected to believe arya just shook it off and went on a sprintparkour session through town ending in her beating a clearly superior and healthier adversary she may as well have used an iron man suit or hulked out for the amount of realism in the scene

asoiaf,removed,yes op it can still happen but now i need to say something to the idiots who say that hype is dead ffs why does everyone think that cleganebowl cant happen because the king banned trial by combat after every fucking idiot reviewer said that hype is dead and cleganebowl wont happen are you guys fucking retarded trial by combat being banned wont stop sandor from having a fight with gregor omfg
asoiaf,removed,because carice van houten is a beautiful woman and emilia clarke is an average bottom heavy girl who adds every season
asoiaf,removed,cgi budget i guess i dont see how the dothraki would have arrived maybe things dont really need to make sense on the show im guessing euron is going to save the day make another trumpesque speech whip his cock out and start dry humping danys leg yes most of us were annoyed with this episode not really found anyone saying they thought it was a good episode ive seen people saying that many of us are being too harsh critics but fuck that it sucked
asoiaf,removed,actually my definition of the stranger involves sitting on your dominant hand until it falls asleep and then doing the deed using your nondominant hand is called the mongoloid to me
asoiaf,removed,these types of posts are so annoyingbasically everyones complaining because they didnt understand ithow condescending people understand what happened it was just such a rush job and so clunky i dont know how anyone can be happy with it
asoiaf,removed,comvert to islam and shes milf again
asoiaf,removed,rickon is killed the war starts bolton co have the upper hand and almost win knights of the vale swoop in and save the day ramsay gets the shit beat out of him is held prisoner and then fed to his dogs jon becomes kingindanorf the end
asoiaf,removed,safe for now all those characters are surviving the season
asoiaf,removed,pretty much everything you wrote is the same as the spoiler that was released at the beginning of the season i dont think thats coincidence
asoiaf,removed,you cant just reiterate the same line over and over again that would be retarded
asoiaf,removed,its about theon and sansa being brutalized in wf each in their own specific way or are you arguing theon has it better than sansa if it was only sansa whats the point of showing the rape scene we all knew it was going to happen the point was that ramsay wasnt going to treat sansa well and that theon would be powerless to stop him
asoiaf,removed,i was raped when i was much younger the male perspective on rape is somehow lacking im done with you
asoiaf,removed,good point when i heard it i thought he said one of them too which really doesnt make sense i mean disregarding the fact that its hard to stop two armies fighting once the battle is underway theyd still have to get to ramsay i know he likes to fight shirtless at the front of his forces but maybe this time hell stay inside winterfell and deny them the option of sniping him your alternative makes sense also with the leaked synopsis that terms of surrender are rejected maybe jon says challenges ramsay saying thousands of men dont need to die only one of us and ramsays response is something like surrender to me and nobody has to die which jon would of course reject
asoiaf,removed,well ready your anus for the inevitable downvoting that you are bound to experience sooner rather than later reddits users are unfortunately too stupid to adhere this sites and its subreddits rules concerning downvoting which ought not to be used as a disagree button
asoiaf,removed,i think the obvious death will be rickon but youre probably right about wun wun as well
asoiaf,removed,there are a lot of details from this battle that leaked that i didnt predict happening sure the ending is predictable but what actually happens during the battle isnt a lot of people dont even realize that ramsay retreats back inside of winterfell
asoiaf,removed,you know linda
asoiaf,removed,noticed his hands during the speech as wellnice pickup he really did look uncomfortable i really think something bad is in store for tommen i know its already a given that he is going to die but based on the last few episodes i think hes going to go out in a tragic way prediction i think that now that cercei has no option for trial by combat shes going to know shes screwedso shes going to tell tommen straightup that hes a bastard and a product of incest and that if she goes to trial she will be found guilty and as a consequence tommen will no longer be king he is already weak and insecure but this will completely break him i think he will kill himself which will make cercei absolutely snapand then shell burn the city
asoiaf,removed,jesus these thread titles does anyone else think did anyone else notice am i the only one who these are not descriptive titles theyre absolutely useless
asoiaf,removed,oh god another one of these threads
asoiaf,removed,glenn glenn dies spoilers from the filming has shown that glenn dies
asoiaf,removed,naw id rather call you out these appreciation threads are tired old and about as much fun to read as the user manual for a year old vcr keep the great content coming
asoiaf,removed,check this out there is a since deleted well known reddit post about a bunch of got season spoilers that have been spot on so far knowing this he stated that ramsey does not die and is instead taken prisoner by jon snow so knowing this consider a statement sophie turner made while playing truths and a lie dies stoneheart returns checks people off her list again we know now know that ramsey does not diemind blown
asoiaf,removed,no
asoiaf,removed,check this out there is a since deleted well known reddit post about a bunch of got season spoilers that have been spot on so far knowing this he stated that ramsey does not die and is instead taken prisoner by jon snow so knowing this consider a statement sophie turner made while playing truths and a lie dies stoneheart returns checks people off her list again we know now know that ramsey does not diemind blownwow
asoiaf,removed,all due respect this is an rgameofthrones shitpost not rasoiaf material
asoiaf,removed,did she though yes she did lol rewatch season its not the wildfire everyone jumping to conclusions again just like with arya
asoiaf,removed,because it makes dickheads like you upset and thats funny
asoiaf,removed,i believe so i think it was also used when jon executived janos slynt
asoiaf,removed,no not all targaryens are mad you would know this had you made an effort to read the books so your entire theory is based on false assumption again you can despise her character but to mock others based on foolish immature lack of circumstantial evidence and illthought out ideas are in your own words is annoying
asoiaf,removed,listen why dont you chill and bugger off you startes this unintelligent conversation getting rank in your school is not a reflection of yoyr intelligence critical thinking skills are which you cleatly lackyou obviously have not read the bookyou are here because you watch the show i hate medicores like you who watch the show and come on these forums to show off what you think is intelligence when all you display is mediocrity
asoiaf,removed,i think he may have heard it from donald trump that mother fucker hears all sorts of things
asoiaf,removed,jon as a stereotypical bastard huh i assume hed be drunk a lot and have a reputation for roughing ygritte up on a regular basis also ghost would clearly be sick but jon would never take him the vet maester hed be known for borrowing small sums of money from friends without ever repaying and cheating at cards hed talk about how mancy rayder is going to make westeros great again whenever in his cups loudly telling everyone how the wall would soon be feet higher and how mance will make the white walkers pay for it
asoiaf,removed,i like the new system set leaks arent so common that itll be a toobig hassle for the mods to approve spoilers production and the reposts were certainly annoying removing the minileaks from extended i welcome our new overlord tag will probably finally settle down the people who dont want to have plotpoints spoiled by random grainy photos or sophie turner lying in two truths and a lie or at least i think she lied my question is about something old posting pirated material or linking to it is strictly prohibited now obviously asking for pirates or linking to for example torrent sites is forbidden thats clear but what about more degrees of separation for example can you link or talk about a sub that doesnt have our rules afaik some time back uimaginarywesteros allowed at least the discussion of pirated content the great spring leakening i think then there are all the conspiracy theories regarding the freefolk some are convinced you cant even mention them here false im sure others say that you cant link to them im not sure about this one since theres a lot of confusion regarding the topic in pms and on these other subs at least could you clear things up so that everyone sees it here
asoiaf,removed,yes of course that is what i meant takes me back to my old child murdering days come on dont be an idiot
asoiaf,removed,kids these days holy balls wtf
asoiaf,removed,you are literally playing the sexism card willnilly its okay a lot of young people these days have been taught to call any opinion they disagree with sexist or racist youre just par for the course bronn straight up defies cersei has assassins sent after him and then ends up killing them he does absolutely nothing to hurt tyrion other than refuse to sacrifice his life meaninglessly correct choice see martell oberyn i know logic might not be your strong suit but try to see how person actively killing cerseis agents is a bit different than person actively trying to kill tyrion
asoiaf,removed,such a cocktease
asoiaf,removed,fewer
asoiaf,removed,do it then show me one famous white person with actual black hair youre all disagreeing with me and telling me about your supposed black haired white relatives yet no ones got any actual shit to show
asoiaf,removed,no you precious snowflake your view is less valid than mine in this case because you are demonstrably incorrect and i am demonstrably correct our opinions here are not equally valid this is not a matter of taste or opinion you are wrong i am right littlefinger creates every single situation you contradict yourself in your own reply there presumably because you dont know what youre saying if he sets up the dominoes and hopes they fall to where he wants hes creating the situations hes not taking advantage of dominoes falling hes setting up dominoes in a particular way thats creating the situation its not chaos and hes controlling it just fine
asoiaf,removed,that if i can crush you and your independence is conditional upon following an order i gave you it doesnt matter how diplomatic i am or whether i shake your hand vs making you kneel im the one with all the power and im being nice youre still not truly independent and if i change my mind theres nothing you can do about it
asoiaf,removed,i know shes my damn capture you hooligans i dont know what she wants from me though
asoiaf,removed,wouldnt torrent
asoiaf,removed,like trump eh
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,burn them all
asoiaf,removed,very likely my sources tell me itll happen a publication date will be announced at the end of the episode via twitter post by grrm himself
asoiaf,removed,this comment contains spoilers outside the thread scope and was removed please cover the spoilers and we can reapprove this comment to make spoiler tags type this s like this to get this s like this
asoiaf,removed,super hyped for the wildfirework show especially if its soundtracked by this from the recently released ost it will be beautiful
asoiaf,removed,cmon show as little dorne as possible lets do this d kingindanorf danys sad breakup with daario danytyrion talky talky cersei gets violent
asoiaf,removed,question what are the odds of cersei andor tommen surviving the episode
asoiaf,removed,so why is cerise going to burn the mall
asoiaf,removed,what stores do they have at the mall that will be burned
asoiaf,removed,jesus that sucks there is a specific subreddit that has links specifically for got if you feel so inclined
asoiaf,removed,sansa nudes tonight please dear god
asoiaf,removed,sandsnakes nooooooo
asoiaf,removed,i dont think so
asoiaf,removed,iron fist
asoiaf,removed,sparrow trump the worst
asoiaf,removed,cant wait for high sanders to get firebombed
asoiaf,removed,westerosi bernie sanders gonna feel the burn
asoiaf,removed,oh fuck me marg didnt deserve iti hoped at least she would make it out
asoiaf,removed,help a brother out wont you
asoiaf,removed,i mentioned that in a post i made earlier today i didnt want to flat out say csection because the mods have been quick to pull down things that resemble the spoilers that other subreddit claim to be true
asoiaf,removed,right behind isis cersei
asoiaf,removed,can someone link me for a live stream mine just stopped working pleaseeeeeeeeee pssorry for yelling
asoiaf,removed,gotta protect the snowflakes i consider it uncivil for someone proven to be demonstrably wrong to reply our opinions are equally valid im reporting the precious snowflakes reply please give the snowflake the same warning thanks champ
asoiaf,removed,so i gotta say everything that was leaked has been correct so far almost anyway
asoiaf,removed,that girl is arya calling it now
asoiaf,removed,the fire and blood was so award
asoiaf,removed,i dunno maybe an episode that didnt have such a glaringly obvious conclusion from episodes before it being the mole town meeting between lf and sansa if the complex twist is lf showing up at the end of the battle for this season then that is a joke it looked great and tried to pull on your heart strings with rickon although he was hardly a part of the show but i think the only thing you could say about the botb that is the best thing on tv ever is perhaps its cinematography which was pretty spectacular the only thing causing anyone to even consider this the best moment of got forget tv is emotions and hype that come from a well shot battle sequence so if you were to try and prove that objectively this is the best twenty minutes of tv you would come up painfully short
asoiaf,removed,thats my king though dakingindanorf the white wolf
asoiaf,removed,thats my king though dakingindanorf the white wolf
asoiaf,removed,eat shit preston jacobs what ya gonna complain about now ya sweet robin loving dick
asoiaf,removed,geralt lives again
asoiaf,removed,definitely him they literally fucking cut to john anybody that theorizes anything else is an absolute retard
asoiaf,removed,thats is an excuse no i wont chill i was fucking hyped because up until that moment i was sure varys was gonna set up faegon in dorne making us all think oh right fire and blood thats dany right when in reality it was a bait but no it actually was dany and literal months passed a single episode no fuck it theres streamlining and then theres just not making any lick of sense
asoiaf,removed,rip my nigga kevan
asoiaf,removed,why dont you just go eat shit and not complain what are you unhappy why criticize a show huh who are you fuck off you stupid strawmanning fuck get some taste
asoiaf,removed,never
asoiaf,removed,varys must have set his hearthstone in the inn in mareen he hearthed back after he was done in dorne so he could be in that sick team dany shot
asoiaf,removed,so the implications in the scene with the septa and cersei is that the mountain is pretty much going to rape the septa thats pretty fucking dark
asoiaf,removed,just wear brown ones
asoiaf,removed,are you really so close minded that you dont realize those scenes are clearly far apart temporally
asoiaf,removed,yeah uh dont be so stupid man although bran may be super psyched to tell jon the news
asoiaf,removed,imwithhim
asoiaf,removed,her hands are bigger than trump ironically
asoiaf,removed,make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,why bother leaving this asshole comment its clear that he traveled no ones questioning that its just weird that he rolls up on one continent then is halfway across the world about minutes of screentime later at least it took him an entire episode to get to dorne
asoiaf,removed,if they say that multiple times in the show you think youre the authority of inheritable titles what else dont we know about the show mr cowriter
asoiaf,removed,shame on a nigga that tried to run game on a nigga cersei
asoiaf,removed,fuck those bookless bastards
asoiaf,removed,like i said earlier he rolls up on one continent then is halfway across the world about minutes of screentime later it took him an entire episode to get to dorne the inconsistency is an oversight does that make sense to you
asoiaf,removed,we can stop pretending showwatchers are literally retarded any time now
asoiaf,removed,aryas pie was satisfying ushieraseastar
asoiaf,removed,yea i always thought they couldnt make someone worse than joffrey well they did even gave her the same gay lil haircut as joffrey
asoiaf,removed,yet another reason why splitting the discussion into regions is fucking hamfisted and stupid goddamn mods need to get their heads out of their own asses
asoiaf,removed,shut the fuck up
asoiaf,removed,i think you missed something she is still alive theres your proof right there or this the other lords of dorne didnt send their soldiers to kill her or this theres an entire chapter in affc whose sole purpose is to establish that everyone wants a war those were my counters would you like me to meet you somewhere and shout them at you also the subject matter of this sub includes the book series not just the show you seem to not be aware that one was even written because you completely ignore every point i bring up from it
asoiaf,removed,lady mormont for queen of the north make the north great again build the wall feet higher and make the white walkers pay for it
asoiaf,removed,imwithher
asoiaf,removed,thatll show trump
asoiaf,removed,we need professional lip reading right now
asoiaf,removed,your comment reads like the ramblings of a crazy person
asoiaf,removed,people always seem to forget jamie gave bram the tommen treatment
asoiaf,removed,people always seem to forget jamie gave bram the tommen treatment
asoiaf,removed,people always seem to forget jamie gave bram the tommen treatment
asoiaf,removed,people always seem to forget jamie gave bram the tommen treatment

asoiaf,removed,sound slike the little nigga who was in star wars with lando calrissian
asoiaf,removed,this is the answer please up vote
asoiaf,removed,make winterfell great again
asoiaf,removed,i will more people would read the books and understand the depth of the characters especially the female ones thankfully the stupid internet outrage settled down a bit this season maybe because there was less nudity but the perpetually outraged and sjws were going full force for awhile again got
asoiaf,removed,when the camera stayed i realized how right the person who leaked info on this season was they literally got everything right and i didnt believe it when i read it
asoiaf,removed,the only reason the sand snakes think they have the bad pousssey is they havent tasted mine uh im gonna go take the black before the police get here
asoiaf,removed,i loved this gif the first times i saw it
asoiaf,removed,im getting pretty sick of people with two neurons
asoiaf,removed,make the north great again
asoiaf,removed,i didnt
asoiaf,removed,t this is probably the stupidest thing ive read all week
asoiaf,removed,i see i have offended you by interrupting the circlejerk there was nothing badass about lyanna mormont except maybe how far her eyes are apart and how she looks like a fucking toad i would bash that bitch with a club
asoiaf,removed,dude theres dying and then theres raped to death were not talking statistics were taking existential misery if i had to choose between being beheaded by isis and being experimented on by nazis im going isis every time
asoiaf,removed,if you want to criticize writing then spell the characters name right at least or stop complaining
asoiaf,removed,here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your schoolwork or is unavailable for any reason lady mormont ftw post title spoilers main lady mormont for president top when someone doesnt pickup their phone
asoiaf,removed,had to double check i wasnt still on rthedonald
asoiaf,removed,high sparrow is like a homophobic bernie sanders
asoiaf,removed,if you truly want to remain unspoiled yeah i wouldnt watch unless twow come out before theres been a few reveals that as a book reader wouldve been much more satisfying to read hodor and rlj for examples since i was a show first guy i dont mind especially since theyve diverged to some degree and i like visual medium more than the book personal preference but yeah if youre a true book purist id stop now if i wouldnt have already
asoiaf,removed,stop making me blush
asoiaf,removed,dude you jist went full retardnever go full retard
asoiaf,removed,i imagine this is what its like to go home to hillary clinton every night
asoiaf,removed,im just wondering hw clegane can get it up without any blood flow
asoiaf,removed,heres an upvote to offset some knuckledraggers downvote
asoiaf,removed,nah marge figured it out and tried to leave but were stopped by the retard brigade
asoiaf,removed,make them tits calm dude im just giving my opinion on a show i never really read the books i get it no one owns her but hes loyal as fuck and proves it over and over again and hes been by her dide since jump street i just feel like he should have a chance of getting out of the zone also the shows and the books are so different at this point from what i know that theres no point in comparing the characters or their situations beliefs and emotions givejorahaashot
asoiaf,removed,make the north great again
asoiaf,removed,damn straight you can die happy now go jump out a windo
asoiaf,removed,if you think brans plot was about killing wights you might actually be retarded
asoiaf,removed,reminded me of the last images in the trailer for the tyranny of king washington dlc for assassins creed
asoiaf,removed,cersei is basically hillary clinton
asoiaf,removed,jon and dany arent really all that different while dany is ambitious at heart she still cares a great deal about other people she didnt need to liberate the slaves she could have taken the gold and ships when offered and marched on to westeros but she couldnt leave people to be treated as property likewise despite the history of bloodshed between the freefolk and the nights watch jon couldnt leave the wildlings to be slaughtered by the night king dany has a temper but is still willing to listen to reason and the opinions of others i think she and jon would actually work well together
asoiaf,removed,who are you hillary varys was literally standing behind danys right shoulder screen left
asoiaf,removed,k son
asoiaf,removed,holy strawman batman
asoiaf,removed,nah no a his name is robert paulson
asoiaf,removed,such a tired and lazy comment
asoiaf,removed,this is irrelevant to this episode go away
asoiaf,removed,they are their own external threat if they are not centralized i dont think you grasp the concept of internal and external bud didnt address the rest of my points the rest of your crap is basically what is talking about about people on the internets on feudalism and absolutism
asoiaf,removed,evergrowing trend nigga the series is based on cool calculating powerful female leaders cersei and dany have been around since book one my man
asoiaf,removed,wow what a fantastic thread title so descriptive wowww
asoiaf,removed,rip bernie sanders
asoiaf,removed,guys i just pulled the best prank ever my friend aiden had to wear a suit to school cause of a speech that he had in one class but i sit behind him in english class i put thumbtacks on his chair and he sat on them punctured his asscheeks and was pouring blood and crying like httpmylolfacecomassetsfacessadcryingjpg it was the funniest shit ever i got detention but i was httpragefacesmemesoftwarecomfaceslargetrolltrollcrazyinsanelpng
asoiaf,removed,the sand snakes have martell blood you nit
asoiaf,removed,fuck off
asoiaf,removed,top kek
asoiaf,removed,you made a new reddit account just to post how much you hated last nights episode twice
asoiaf,removed,oh for fucks sake the whole season has been slowly revealing what happened at the tower of joy lyannas appearance in the finale was all buy certain get off this sub altogether if it takes this little to trigger your spoiler sensors
asoiaf,removed,poor bernie sanders hillary got him again but he felt the burn today
asoiaf,removed,uashan in case he hasnt found the surprise yet
asoiaf,removed,but the entire plot of stannis in the war of the five kings heavily involves magic stannis and magic directly kills one of the kings and possibly of the others
asoiaf,removed,funny i read asoiaf during some of my formative years as a writer and now my writing style is very strong on rhythmic pacing of wordflow thanks to my wellplaced utilization of italics thank george
asoiaf,removed,wow you are truly a fucking retard youre opinion sucks and you point our grammatical errors speaking of grammatical errors what is a prizetag its a price tag moron get a life and get off this sub you are hateful
asoiaf,removed,dont count your chickens until they hatch man the show is different from the books anyways and all they have done is show jon is lyannas son no need to get butt hurt about people having different thoughts
asoiaf,removed,a lot of people joke about dying or grrm dying before the series is finished roy dotrice is basically the for sure bet for death hes now and will be before twow releases bday is in may i hope we get twow narrated by him but i have to wonder who theyll get for ados
asoiaf,removed,well take a look at the leaks if you want lets say its not top notch quality
asoiaf,removed,thats the dumbest reasoning for thinking it would be different that would be like changing the fate of jesus in the bible for the tv adaptation its literally stupid to think it would be anything but what has already been established especially seeing as how that single plot point alone is what landed dd the rights from grrm likethey arent fucking with it at all in the slightest so why you think it might be anything other than what weve all been revealed is asinine
asoiaf,removed,before we start remember that the civility policy still applies this is so hard
asoiaf,removed,pizzagate runs deep
asoiaf,removed,linda antonsson
asoiaf,removed,dont hate me but rhaenyra targaryen after her kids httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphprhaenyratargaryen
asoiaf,removed,better than trump
asoiaf,removed,i dont remember what ian mcshane spoiled can you remind me
asoiaf,removed,if someone has read all of the books watched all of the show and doesnt care about spoilers they have no reason to limit the scope of the conversation that they are starting just because there might be someone else out there that hasnt finished reading the books or is worried about spoilers it is their discussion their time their energy their work at the same time there is a very real chance that if they try to use any other spoiler setting from this subreddits utterly byzantine spoiler policy they might get something wrong and get punished so instead of trying to simplify things and make things more straightforward the mods have come up with a policy to try to bully posters in to using other spoiler tags they are using the stick instead of the carrot more bureaucracy and more risk instead of incentive and greater ease of use it sucks that i saw leaked spoilers thats your own fault you have no one to blame for that but yourself what does it say about you that you want to make other peoples lives more difficult to cover for your screwup
asoiaf,removed,fucking asshole
asoiaf,removed,this is fucking dumb
asoiaf,removed,with the casting rumors i hope we see rhaegar and lyanna at the tourney of harrenhall
asoiaf,removed,you your logic and your analysis of symbolism are vomitinducing dont quit your day job unless that day job is literary analysis

asoiaf,removed,you lost me when you started equating son with sun although i got to congratulate you on something youve finally made the tinfoil in this subreddit as batshit insane as antigmo or climate change denial conspiracy theories this might even get up close to the territory of chemtrails
asoiaf,removed,make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,youre missing the point that i was paying you a compliment there is no need to jump on the offended train yes were book readers that is why the spelling of a word is important to its context a son does not provide light and energy to the world a sun does not come out of a womans vagina its not a play on words its a deliberate misinterpretation grrm does not play on words dd do not play on words they tell stories not try to confuse people by showing that they dont know how to spell threeletter words go back to rconspiracy
asoiaf,removed,nobodys going to pay attention to that the mods are overvaluing their own importance they administrate this subreddit for the users the sub belongs to the users the users are the ones who provide content and engage in this subreddit the mods are actively attempting to restrict that for no better reason than for stroking their own egos take a chill pill and just let the subreddit do what it wants to do because this policy is only making this sub haemorrhage subscribers and the other subs more and more popular by the day its not your fault automod youre just doing your job and youre doing it well your bosses are crazy tho
asoiaf,removed,oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,sorry didnt know you guys were so sensitive that you cant take any form of insult wont happen again bud
asoiaf,removed,that is a terrible analogy
asoiaf,removed,so dany is a neonazi
asoiaf,removed,so many of these girls are going to end up using their middle names or going by lee of kellee or some other variation also id say a girl named khaleesi is more likely to end up working on a pole for dollar bills than most other girls
asoiaf,removed,going off of the show and book i honestly see her and tyrion being the most tragic death options for grrm at this point or hero which turns into a villain i feel killing another stark at this point might not trigger the same emotional response as their family has been slaughtered so much throughout the story
asoiaf,removed,its not a thing its pure proof retarded idiocy
asoiaf,removed,arya damn right i named my little girl aryanna she takes right to it i know if im ever betrayed by some twobit bridgelord i trust shell slash some throats
asoiaf,removed,i hope i meet one of these children in twenty years or so so i can tell them how retarded their parents are
asoiaf,removed,every single parent who has named their child this is a moron
asoiaf,removed,khaleesi toneesha la queesha laronda tilisha twylite yashiika zaniqwa targaryen has a nice ring to it
asoiaf,removed,a lot of you are coming off as judgmental arrogant assholes and confirmations of the worse stereotypes of our fandom
asoiaf,removed,just wait until someone thinks cerseis name is your grace and names their daughter grace ha what an idiot
asoiaf,removed,who the fuck cares if its a title in the series you self important twats
asoiaf,removed,couldnt you also say farwyndtrump with some of the grandiose claims
asoiaf,removed,house trump sigil a toupee house words sad
asoiaf,removed,aka a hilary elizabeth warren ticket
asoiaf,removed,u mean house drumpf
asoiaf,removed,with a big beautiful wall to protect all like in the north a well manned and funded army and his daughter ruling as the god empress yeah that sounds about right
asoiaf,removed,no of course it isnt not to be rude but have you been paying attention all of the major events of the story revolve around rhaegar and lyannas actions and around jon snow jons parentage and the implications thereof form the core of an interconnected web of storylines and events
asoiaf,removed,i have no idea what this is about but im really interested now
asoiaf,removed,then youre an idiot
asoiaf,removed,thank you ujoemagician for redirecting me here long time lucker anyway i wanted to humbly ask that the moderation crew members of rasoiaf to cease and desist with using the admins as a weapon against rival subreddits
asoiaf,removed,its certainly reasonable to speculate as such were later shown in affc how much the faceless men value gathering intel through hearsay jaqen could well have figured out that a doublecross was underway simply by listening in on the chattering
asoiaf,removed,eurons actor implied that euron is basically playing up his macho act because it fits in with the ironborn its still early so lets not write off dae dd are hackscuz muh ironbarn speech not thar yet please
asoiaf,removed,sigh saying aerys is not tyrions father in a thread discussing alternate parentage theories is exactly equivalent to saying not true or wrongcontext dude context if youd like to see my contributions take a look i expected more from someone with a cyvasse related name from the sounds of it hodor would beat you bad in cyvasse
asoiaf,removed,pls george
asoiaf,removed,he ded
asoiaf,removed,maybe hes dead
asoiaf,removed,oh sweet summer child

asoiaf,removed,what did he say
asoiaf,removed,tinfoil onoff grrm just died the publishers are covering it up but brandon sanderson cant figure out his blog password to post in his place
asoiaf,removed,is he pulling a robert jordan
asoiaf,removed,he was found clutching a twinkie in one hand and a syringe in the other
asoiaf,removed,or just dream of the ending to the series because he may die before releasing any more books
asoiaf,removed,httpiimgurcomaseqaujjpg ten thousand of your children perished in my palm your grace she thought slipping a third finger into myr whilst you snored i would lick your sons off my face and fingers one by one all those pale sticky princes you claimed your rights my lord but in the darkness i would eat your heirs
asoiaf,removed,when he finally says haha aint got shit aint got shit aint had shit yesterday aint got shit today aint got shit for tomorrow aint got shit motherbitches i got money tho hahahahahaha money money money haha motherbitches imma get up outta here yall stay up haha aint got shit i am going to say i told you so
asoiaf,removed,hey not to be that guy but seriously its been hours post the damn photo if this even happened in the first place this type of shit belongs on rthathappened
asoiaf,removed,fuck off same joke every time
asoiaf,removed,yea smartass he was talking about the film crew being so far back
asoiaf,removed,go be a dick some where else
asoiaf,removed,haha the commenter it was acting all neck beard because op is a girl
asoiaf,removed,so apparently emilia and kit are both filming together in spain so nothing to disprove the mary sue and marty stu have sex with each other leaks
asoiaf,removed,if the leaks are anything to go by bad poosey will soon be dead poosey i am kinda hoping that part of the leaks is true tough i hope we get some more skin time before that
asoiaf,removed,im starting to believe that leak was real
asoiaf,removed,rumors posted earlier are looking really likely
asoiaf,removed,the leaker claimed the meeting would happen in episode not like its confirmed im sorry i dont follow how is it confirmed the meeting will be in ep
asoiaf,removed,supposedly in the finale as theyre setting sail for eastwatch to fight nk
asoiaf,removed,and danys taking cock and clam from all comers these days
asoiaf,removed,posts like this one should be deleted by the mods
asoiaf,removed,heinlein was a strong conservative as were many of the great classic sf writers even a leftie like vonnegut wrote harrison bergeron which when the pc left starts banning literature will probably be among the first to go
asoiaf,removed,ah fuck off politically correct loser
asoiaf,removed,take a break from the computer champ
asoiaf,removed,so what youre saying is you literally didnt watch the video youre disparaging youre going out of your way to be negative youre refusing to make any attempt to engage with the content on screen and are instead heaping baseless criticism upon it which it arguably doesnt deserve hm
asoiaf,removed,and todays word of the day is objective objective means unbiased criticism based on factual evidence which is not at all how preston operates he sees something that isnt thoroughly explained and decides to rip it apart instead of filling the gaps himself in order to reaffirm his opinion that the show is awful based on the loose fact that the writing isnt as strong as it once was
asoiaf,removed,whats with the guy who always comments about licking ass
asoiaf,removed,heres a noob guide on how to enjoy gotasoiaf read books read show realize both are two different entities and the show is not going to have all random charactersplots george put in the book be happy
asoiaf,removed,this just made me realize that alt shift x hasnt released his episode video its been two weeks anyone a patreon donor and now what the timeline for release is
asoiaf,removed,youve been voted i shit you not bc the pc drones on here are conditioned to vote down anything in any way unpc
asoiaf,removed,too bad his character who we have been following since season is getting eclipsed because girl power must be established
asoiaf,removed,it seems very easy to infer that cersei sent the mountain to find him what did cersei show him a picture of the guy did she make a sketch for him i appreciate your ability to take things at surface value and not want to analyze it but thats not how a lot of people who watch game of thrones operate and its certainly not what people who read the book series operate
asoiaf,removed,this guys reviews blow i love the books more than the show like most of you here but come on man he sounds like hes got such an ego if something doesnt go down the way he thinks yeah i do t think this season was perfect or anything but i still think its pretty good i wish asx would release his review already
asoiaf,removed,if u dont watch the video so why you feel the need to come into the discussing thread of said video to bash it
asoiaf,removed,the books are a little complicated a lot more characters you intimately get to know all those bannermen and minor houses other major characters and its a different pace for example hellos like this
asoiaf,removed,he updated mainly norse myths and legends that had existed for centuries he was inspired by his own culture face it tolkien was just as unoriginal as grrm is how dare you go slap yourself he originated the genre and grrm is a pigeon in his kingdom
asoiaf,removed,im astounded that it could have gone over your head given that you seem to sit on such a high horse ha you cant hide behind a computer tyrion well figuratively you cant
asoiaf,removed,yes its just him being disgruntled his nonsensical theories have been shot down by the show again and again im amazed he didnt hurt himself after the rlj confirmation he was so big on the story giving it all to daenerys sue
asoiaf,removed,preston enjoy that salad dressing its more interesting than you and your autism in martins eyes
asoiaf,removed,are you some kind of preston fanboy youve said this same thing like times in this thread
asoiaf,removed,another weekly play by play of the latest episode its altshift x though so rasoiaf will cream itself
asoiaf,removed,well im sorry i did apologize and i didnt mean it as an insult in the first place but ill try to be less snarky in my responses in the future
asoiaf,removed,i didnt start a slap fight i defended myself
asoiaf,removed,im filing that response right next to the idiot claiming that stannis is still alive
asoiaf,removed,what is the allure behind preston if you dont mind me asking
asoiaf,removed,i dont disagree with you i think a lot of people hitched their wagon to preston and since he turned out to be painfully wrong all that is left from his followers is misguided and myopic angst and armchair tv criticism
asoiaf,removed,personally i like cersei as hillary and trump as the night king i dont think hillary has had her wildfire moment yet though i think trump brings the storm
asoiaf,removed,i do have my own opinions on why i disliked season coincidental as it is they also happened to be the same as prestons issues with it he didnt tell me how i should feel about it he articulated my feelings about the show far better than i could
asoiaf,removed,another bloke danarys might hook up with is jon he is ice and she is fire right guys they are also first cousins how about mentioning that as a reason they wont be getting married anytime soon
asoiaf,removed,i get it but i still wish spoilers everything didnt include the pre release chapters because everyone uses spoilers everything for any discussion im telling you my opinion and you keep trying to tell me im wrong so why dont you just shut the fuck up and quit bothering me
asoiaf,removed,it is only natural to not know why you dislike something if you dislike or like something is generaly decided by your subconsciousness your consciousness then has the task to invent a revisionist history of why you dodont like it what i want to say is the reason you likedislike something is only very very losely connected to what you think that reason is if you look at it from that angle it is only logical to watch some critical stuff to find out what might be the reason you hate the show
asoiaf,removed,one could argue one could but one shouldnt people shouldnt need to be hit in the head with a hammer if theyre going to make fun of showonly people for needing the same
asoiaf,removed,not as much with how many responses but more of the quality of your response is what makes you a cunt
asoiaf,removed,i didnt feel the need to report him
asoiaf,removed,doesnt seem like you actually watched this the criticism is that lancel was sent to collect cersei not that she was getting arrested again for no reason even though yes several episodes before the trial lancel comes to arrest not an official legal term in westeros her in advance of the trial the mountain kills one of them by ripping his head off and the rest of the sparrows run away minutes of careful analysis and this is all you can spit up say what you want about the tinfoil and shit this guy is way smarter than you
asoiaf,removed,thats an unfair judgment on your part i phrased my differences fairly and upvoted all dissent for shame
asoiaf,removed,why are you dick riding someone that people clearly dislike in this sub and i did point out what i didnt like about the content this content happens to be someone reviewing so the person is more or less apart of the content
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,it does relate to the topic because preston confuses both show and book
asoiaf,removed,love all these comments filled with tv autists that wouldnt voice these opinions here because theyd be afraid of getting downvoted
asoiaf,removed,a raging nitpicker detected
asoiaf,removed,i didnt say there was nothing wrong with the show im saying i couldnt take his incessant whining about it you bring up good points and i even say the same about his videos it is interesting but his videos can be aggressively toxic for something i consume as entertainment i like how im accused of drinking the kook aide and basically told im an idiot for holding this option thought very welcoming place you got here
asoiaf,removed,why even bother commenting go back to rgameofthrones and jerking off over memes if you cant accept the show being able to have valid criticism and analysis thrown at it half the flaws he points out are blah blah and i can say this even though i didnt watch it greatest show ever seriously idiot
asoiaf,removed,yay thanks very much leslie d
asoiaf,removed,my bad edited out the end bit
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,cough cough cough cough cough cough
asoiaf,removed,youre the one pissing and moaning about everything being bastardized martin has already said there are stark differences between the show and the books this has been known for quite some time several seasons in fact just stop bitching about anything being ruined no one who watches the show cares
asoiaf,removed,hooray for care bear subreddits so lame
asoiaf,removed,anyone who watched the battle of the bastards and thought thats awesome i want to be there is a fucking idiot the show does not glorify violence it is ugly and brutal and no one is ever shown a gallant hero in any battle or fight ever in this show preston jacobs is a moron
asoiaf,removed,well build a wall and make the first wall pay for it
asoiaf,removed,preston jacobs went from a mildly entertaining theory crafter to a snobby douche that literally thinks his theories are the best way for the story to play out let me say that again he thinks hes more clever than the author how he thinks he is the voice of a song and ice and fire is just amazingly and infuriatingly arrogant
asoiaf,removed,delete your account
asoiaf,removed,the girl raised up her head but made no answer she has no tongue to answer with the damphair knew he licked his lips and tasted salt the forsaken aeron i twow one of my favourite chapter
asoiaf,removed,i dont want to call you an idiot for labeling the tower of joy the siege of riverrun and benjens return as filler but you are wrong and your opinion is shit
asoiaf,removed,this shows terrible fans are retarded too hbo is the only entertainment channel worth watching
asoiaf,removed,aaah welcome internet doctor
asoiaf,removed,dont we see bran walking in his green dreams in the show at least
asoiaf,removed,all the points made here are about the show then its only logical that this should be posted in rgameofthrones no this sub discuss both which is why i like it go and linger in rpureasoiaf if this post bothers you that much or heres cents to call someone who cares
asoiaf,removed,i would rather it go unfinished than let elio and linda shit all over its legacy
asoiaf,removed,if you think that the show makes more sense than the books then toy a clearly inbred
asoiaf,removed,heh i actually didnt catch it per se my roommate did i was reading allowed to annoy my roommate the part where loras goes nuts because renly gets killed and he said something like thats why you dont fuck with faggots he is gay and it clicked i was more amazed he caught it with such little background
asoiaf,removed,dany was maybe a few hours from landing at the end of so i dont think winter will ravage the north and make it accessible that quickly
asoiaf,removed,i think thatd be cool but i also feel like arya would of had some inkling of it she knew when nymeria pulled her mother out of the river jon seemed to have pretty good ideas about where the other wolves were i hope its true but i feel like robb would of been like mom there were get this two wolves
asoiaf,removed,hey waymar royce is a damn hero the likes of which westeros will never see again waymar
asoiaf,removed,the fat man should focus on completing the book instead of going to some emmys
asoiaf,removed,zoo wee mama
asoiaf,removed,its a cool thought and maybe true but if nymeria helped she didnt have her superpack at that time she appear to start building it towards the end of acok and seemingly has it it at great strength by affc
asoiaf,removed,no they are assigned to where the citadel sends them technically theyre not assigned to a lord but to a castle
asoiaf,removed,it would have been bad strategy ned knew that conflict with the lannisters couldnt be avoided had he brought theon the lannisters would have captured him and forced balon greyjoy to attack the north balon attacked the north anyway but thats just because hes an asshole
asoiaf,removed,hindsight theon would have never been in the iron islands to start the invasion of the north foresight theon would be near and couldnt cause mischief
asoiaf,removed,on this topic ive always wondered how it is that sam can just show up at the citadel to receive his training to become the new maester at the castle black
asoiaf,removed,little birds killed pycelle
asoiaf,removed,the wall is going to fall and people are going to suffer the ww attack still stannis will make westeros great again hell strengthen the watch by building a new focking wall of ice and hell make the wildlings pay for it
asoiaf,removed,i would probably be a raper or a thief i run a cnc laser and coach flag football neither of those skills would help me in westeros but i could steal and fuck
asoiaf,removed,if the telltale games have any credit to the lore they were licensed to the asoiaf universe its just up to any holding that has no maester maester ortengryn wanted to be assigned to the eyrie but since colemon returned after jon arryns death he was sent to ironrath
asoiaf,removed,still no idea what the fuck youre talking about its like the ramblings of a drunk
asoiaf,removed,would have been nice irony if robbcat had offered jon to marry a frey and they turn him down only for rlj to be found out and he wipes out the freys for betraying robb when they could potentially have had the royal grandchildren they wanted
asoiaf,removed,this comment and the following comments have been removed for outofscope spoilers if you cover them up we can reapprove to create a spoiler tag use this code s things happen to get this s things happen then let me know and ill reapprove your comment
asoiaf,removed,there are many words i dont use on a regular basis that doesnt mean i dont learn them and understand them im sorry the scope of your personal experience has been limiting if you keep reading and learning you will find that almost all words come from older languages thats how languages develop over time
asoiaf,removed,that seems to be the case for everything in westeros if you come from nobility you get special treatment even the nights watch gives preferential treatment to highborn recruits also because they usually arent criminals and are likely castle trained fighters ser waymar royce was given the command of the ranging mission despite the fact that he was the least experienced of the lot jon was groomed for lc even as a bastard im assuming benjen was given similar treatment
asoiaf,removed,make westeros great again by rebuilding the arm of dorne
asoiaf,removed,you watch one isis video and youll change your mind
asoiaf,removed,its amazing how people without even a drop of actual text evidence cook this stuff upand get praised for it incredible
asoiaf,removed,i dunno watching the videos from the dnepropetrovsk maniacs or any of the various isis executions would probably make you forget this fake video pretty quick upon seeing some insane real gore
asoiaf,removed,im just trying to theorize how gendry fits into the endgame but i guess time answered for me
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,i know maester aemon declined an offer from his father who was king at the time asking him to be at kings landing to offer counsel
asoiaf,removed,a lot of spoilers are in the show or i already know
asoiaf,removed,i think lord mormont mentions at least once that waymar kept complaining that he didnt get a chance to do anything glorious and he was given command of that expedition to keep him from getting fed up enough to write to daddy and cause problems
asoiaf,removed,riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,just producers cashing in on his recent successes by giving him a small cameo and draw in some extra viewers for the novelty of having seen mcgregor in an episode honestly feels unnecessary and makes the series out to be some network tv sitcom with soecial guest actors for shits and giggles
asoiaf,removed,we can close those are magical effects based on what we know about magic and how it works we didnt just decide they were magic because we couldnt come up with any other explanation
asoiaf,removed,cool story bro
asoiaf,removed,yes and in the context of the fucking story we are talking about dire wolves are not mythical the exist north of the wall and several main characters actually have them as pets in this regard they are not mythical within the asoiaf world just like dragons are not mythical within the story either furthermore and not germane to this discussion is that the actual extinct species is not mythical either that martin borrowed elements or that he intended the same creatures and intended in story exaggerations is irrelevant not sure what point you think youre making but it sure seems like youre wrong
asoiaf,removed,cuz she fine
asoiaf,removed,brynden rivers aka the three eyed crow the really old targ bastard stuck in the roots of the big weirwood
asoiaf,removed,the bitch is fine
asoiaf,removed,hi just a reminder this is a spoilers agot thread can you cover up your second sentence thanks example of spoiler code usage s your spoilers here please make sure the quotes are regular quotes and not fancy quotes
asoiaf,removed,this is an apologists pov your arguments are ridiculous it can easily run for as long as it desires to run money is not an issue for hbo especially since got is their cash cow the actors none of whom are big time stars in hollywood all seem to love the popularity the show has brought them i am sure of them would stay on board for as long as it takes d and d have done a horrible job this is not a minority opinion i still watch the show and like it but it does a disservice to the actual story
asoiaf,removed,hahaha ned you gotta be kidding me in my eyes hes the biggest villian in the book he clings to this artificial sense of morals that he makes up and he kills people and takes their rights from them if they break the rules that he makes up if ned was decent his family would still be living there are no good characters in asoiaf but the closest we can come are characters like septon maribald hotpie and sandor those that did terrible things in the past but are on redemption arcs that make them better people
asoiaf,removed,you seem to be confusing op with ops mom
asoiaf,removed,heres the actual description from the casting call fletcher he is a fat nobleman in his s he has distinctive rugged features a northern accent and a distinguished air our source says he has a stirring speech during which he unexpectedly shifts political allegiances that has to be either wyman manderly or a new character similar to him my money is on the former
asoiaf,removed,holy shit the episode has actually been leaked
asoiaf,removed,gods imagine if they leaked the last episodes like season first
asoiaf,removed,you know ive already seen the episode and no there is no plan there is no switch gutstabbed arya is doing parcour
asoiaf,removed,s neither and it was pretty well done actually the hound is with bwb now get hype
asoiaf,removed,man everyone knows the ep leaked i havent read your theory
asoiaf,removed,theres another reason to get hyped actually the episode leaked and all i can say is s fookin confirmed
asoiaf,removed,in the worst way imaginable this episode was pretty shit all in all but s fookin confirmed
asoiaf,removed,youre about to be so disappointed
asoiaf,removed,oh its true s bwb and the hound team up
asoiaf,removed,elaborate
asoiaf,removed,i loved the episode for what it was except the arya stuff which was even worse than i could ever have imagined
asoiaf,removed,the episode leaked a few hours ago mods might want to have a leaked discussion thread put up or people will spoil the episode in the live episode discussion
asoiaf,removed,what a waste of time that was why would you write this
asoiaf,removed,the episode has been on a certain torrent tracker for a couple of hours now time to put up the post discussion thread
asoiaf,removed,are you watching this show joffreys death man is that not a big enough secret for you
asoiaf,removed,this was one of the worst episodes of the entire seriesim very disappointed right now
asoiaf,removed,it was terrible
asoiaf,removed,well that was meh all the hype theyd built up and it all came crashing down that being said i enjoyed seeing the bwb again even if there was the absence of a certain stonehearted lady
asoiaf,removed,clegane sure loves hic chicken best line of another semi blue balls episode looks like the hound sansa is up for a reunion soon since bwd seems to head north would be to fucking awesome if the hound made it there in time for bastardbowl
asoiaf,removed,its the episode discussion threadare you soft in the head boy
asoiaf,removed,will httpiimgurcomvijunsopng
asoiaf,removed,god i loved the jaime scenes
asoiaf,removed,cleganebowl disconfirmed
asoiaf,removed,the moment arya sipped milk of the poppy i thought she is going to have wolf dreams and warg nymeria just like bran she is deeply injured and subject to a coma like state of mind with the scene that followed the men by the fire i thought they are going to be ravaged by the wolves pack but a hound did all the work so thats cool
asoiaf,removed,the day hype died the day arya developed wolverine type healing powers tbh after that perhaps i am jaded i thought why after all that has been cut did we sit through seasons for that lady crane must be the best surgeon in the planetos being able to suture bowel and muscle arya heals super fast did like clegane bwb i thought dd might screw them over high sparrow outmanouvers again was that the bsg lieutenant that used to be with boomer standing to the left of lancel not sure am glad the queen of thornes was not present hopefully thi means she will survive till next season if the burn them all theories are true bronn and pod was brilliant
asoiaf,removed,so pretty much everyone was wrong with their arya theories from last weeks episode there was no surprise or twist or syrio what we saw is what happened
asoiaf,removed,ah good to see rory mccann and jerome flynn in the credits again i mean i think they were in the credits last week but still
asoiaf,removed,she survives getting gutted and his able to run through the city also killing the waif and the blackfish offscreen jesus that was a shitty episode
asoiaf,removed,i seen the episode 😕 weaksauce
asoiaf,removed,they should have killed him in season this is just retarded waste of budget and actor they could have used him in the north story line instead of killing him off screen its not like jon dosent need an advisor he has a year old lady and a knight who cant fight as hes top advisors
asoiaf,removed,this is fucking retarded
asoiaf,removed,welp first id heard of an all season leak headed over to the megathread to discuss this episode and ended up getting massive finale plot points spoiled in the top post maybe make it clearer in the post above that the leaks include the whole or the rest of the season not just tonights episode that was leaked by an hour or so
asoiaf,removed,they wont dae think dennette and duplo are fucking hacks who cant even handle all the nuance and subtlety of the books which make james joyce look like garbage
asoiaf,removed,if you think that the arya who spoke with the westerosi ship captain is the real arya then you dont understand cinematography its not bad writing this was done on purpose for a reason oh man are going to eat crow how cocksure posters were the show doesnt have time for your subtle games dd are pretty straight forward with their writing
asoiaf,removed,so with no lsh what are everyones thoughts on the role of the bwb we know they dont mind cutting stuff thats not important so clearly they have a role to play but im having trouble placing what it is especially with the hound seemingly joining them
asoiaf,removed,so with no lsh what are everyones thoughts on the role of the bwb we know they dont mind cutting stuff thats not important so clearly they have a role to play but im having trouble placing what it is especially with the hound seemingly joining them
asoiaf,removed,ayy lmao you dumb fucks were all wrong about arya did you idiots actually think dd could ever be that smart
asoiaf,removed,this is a sub for the books you idiot
asoiaf,removed,lets obliterate this episodes rating on imdb
asoiaf,removed,that episode shoulda been called no homo instead of no one random ass fingering in the woods bronnpod crotch grab edmurejaime
asoiaf,removed,itt tinfoils being disappointed their stupid unrealistic theories didnt happen
asoiaf,removed,its one thing to discuss about plausible possibilities but an other thing to create outlandish and weird theories and expect them to happen it blows my mind how so many people here appear smart and creative yet still they absolutely cant comprehend the fact that the show is not the books and that game of thrones is pretty straight forward sometimes i think were not watching the same show people set themselves up for major disappointment and then collectively whine about it its borderline autistic at this point
asoiaf,removed,what in the books edmure likely thought up of something with tom osevens and then went to riverrun and let his uncle escape even jaime noticed that edmure looked too happy considering that he was going to be a prisoner suggesting that he has something up his sleeve given that jeyne is going to be in the prologue im guessing shit is going down on the way to casterly rock likely because of the bwb
asoiaf,removed,dead rickon
asoiaf,removed,and sometimes something not being in the show means it just not important other times its dd are literally hitler and destroying the show
asoiaf,removed,calling it now she burns the sept with him inside and he kills himself rather than burn alive
asoiaf,removed,thats retarded
asoiaf,removed,somebody tip off the sjws dd just made a female character whos only purpose is holes
asoiaf,removed,then why dont you stick to the books only thenoh right
asoiaf,removed,ungregor literally popped that niggas muffin cap off
asoiaf,removed,he made westeros great again yeah id burn my own daughter themannis
asoiaf,removed,fuck off ive been posting here for years
asoiaf,removed,uhhh nigga isnt a racial slur dude
asoiaf,removed,bugger off dr phil
asoiaf,removed,eat a dick
asoiaf,removed,so your version of good writing is to have a bunch of groundbreaking events happen in dorne in the first episode of the season where the people in power shift from one family to another group of female rebels and then abandon the plot for the rest of the season thanks for your input never comment again
asoiaf,removed,damn even in here youre abrasive and displeasant to talk to
asoiaf,removed,guys basically a troll on rfrance wouldnt mind him too much
asoiaf,removed,she was stabbed multiple times drugged broke her legs once then twice hurt her wound again killed the waif and then walked calmly back i knew dd were stupid didnt know they were retarded
asoiaf,removed,if we have berniesparrow and lizardhillarycersei who is our glorious trump
asoiaf,removed,if you dont like it that much stop watching and leave dont assume your opinion is now valid than those that are enjoying it i get it youre unhappy with the direction of the show thats understandable but its not some universal truth personally ive separated the current seasons from the books and am happy i get to experience two versions of the story now
asoiaf,removed,if you thought that what you just saw was great then youre fucking delusional sorry
asoiaf,removed,i expect him to be filled with regret that he could have prevented the whole thing had be been there when he finds out that every person he once loved has been taken from this world the last two people by their own volition i think that story arch delivers a powerful message about how the rich and powerful would rather destroy everything than relinquish what they spent their life accumulating
asoiaf,removed,get a fucking life its only tits and dragons
asoiaf,removed,you know rasputin is mostly a legend right it ruins my enjoyment of the show you arent the only person who matters here
asoiaf,removed,some of you are serious morons do u have no understanding of setting things up for the future this isnt the last episode or even last season calm your fucking jimmies
asoiaf,removed,no that is retarded
asoiaf,removed,in the show nobody is allowed to change arya is the same sansa is the same jon is the same the hound is the same jaime is the same cersei is the same margaery is the same she will be trust me no matter what psychological epiphanies these characters seem to go through in the end they havent changed in the least name one character that has had a change of heart in any capacity whatsoever nobody
asoiaf,removed,everyone who thinks this episode was bad and fookin idiots come on dude this episode had some great dialogues and tbh two girls fighting in total darkness wouldnt have been interesting and fm may not have been as awesome as the books but arya did learn some awesome skills from them
asoiaf,removed,yeah people in america used to settle disputes by firing guns at one another from a few yards apart thats retarded too im glad we dont do that anymore too
asoiaf,removed,in a world where dd are retards is this really a surprise to you i cant wait for prestons reaction to the episode it will be sooooo good
asoiaf,removed,cool no society can function under a judicial system that holds if you are the better fighter in handtohand combat then you cannot be guilty of any crime whatsoever tommen explained it perfectly to you try listening its a retarded law
asoiaf,removed,this sub menjust toxic
asoiaf,removed,no society can sustain itself under that legal system
asoiaf,removed,same thing goes for theon and the hound except way more likely bran should have been dead in the first episode of the show by that logic jaimes severed hand is surely death tyrion should have died due to infection do you want me to keep going like i said you must hate the show the amount of criticisms you must have should be astronomical
asoiaf,removed,you wanted it so so so badly it hurt and this is somehow meant to convince me youre making a rational argument hahaha sigh
asoiaf,removed,it boggles my mind that this has been so highly upvoted if grrm is writing about the weaknesses of feudalism which hardly needs to be done and i fundamentally disagree thats even a major theme of the story but i digress its in the ways that feudal vows force people to compromise on their morals not to show that might makes right is an effective alternative system trump voter logic like this makes me shudder
asoiaf,removed,yeah focusing on details and a consistent plot is for losers
asoiaf,removed,the fuck are you talking about have lee or chan ever even once played an assassin
asoiaf,removed,youre saying that a seldom used but real world concept that existed for centuries across multiple societies is unbelievable did i say that quote me the issue is that you called it unbelievable the issue is that youre confusing political science with elements of a fantasy novel if trial by combat is a sustainable judicial practice because of supernatural powers then let it be stop being a little bitch the concept is retarded and it spaciously retarded to anybody with half a brain
asoiaf,removed,how long was aryas recovery your criticism doesnt hold water and youre trying to justify it ex post facto you have no clue what youre talking about and youre justifying your unjustified beliefs after the fact its sad you should stop commenting
asoiaf,removed,the hound had maggots and other insects eating away at his open wounds before he was healed tyrian jaime arya all had similar recovery times the mountains was dead by standards of modern medicine davos had his fingers cut off and he was blown up and found later without a scratch the hound should have died when his brother burned half his face off i wonder what medical miracle saved him them too not counting brownes pummeling bran fell from an unreasonable height hes dead theon should have died when he was literally crucified and had his penis cut off none of these people were resurrected im down with you your argument doesnt hold water its stupid stop commenting
asoiaf,removed,allahu leafbar
asoiaf,removed,varys is on his way to dorne to meet with olenna at the water gardens according to leaked set information but yes id much rather varys little birds do the stabbing rather than qyburns little birds
asoiaf,removed,i use seven hells all the time now also for the shooting i called it that it was a muslim terrorist as soon as i heard it happened at a gay bar obama would still try and say this wasnt an act of terror but it was
asoiaf,removed,maybe try using google seriously i just typed it in and it turned up
asoiaf,removed,most of us arent teenagers who havent seen that shit times before
asoiaf,removed,lets all be beautiful butterflies and love each other and hold hands whilst we sing about how great the show is fuck off if i have a problem with the show im going to talk about it i dont know why people have such a hard time reading other peoples opinions and the thing is these opinions are absolutely valid most outstanding pieces of media ever produced i like the show but give me a break why is hating on the show bad but blindly loving it like how youre doing is perfectly fine
asoiaf,removed,jesus what a shitfest this thread is
asoiaf,removed,more like rickon with an arrow in him
asoiaf,removed,everybody is bitching about how arya would just go out like that is out of character for it and whining about how the money is a plot hole for one arya knows how to steal we know shes done it before and she pretty heavily implies that she stole the money it isnt that difficult to figure out for two it isnt out of character for arya to react impulsively on an emotion she felt free so she did something that made her feel more free we know shes incredibly impulsive thats why she does this also not a plot hole like when she beats up joffrey yeah joff is a total prick and had it coming but hes the crown fucking prince if her dad wasnt ned she would have lost a hand or when she murdered the freys talking about robbs death again they had it coming but it was a stupid fucking move or when shed sew sheep dung into sansad bed because shes pissed arya acts on emotions she was able to run after three days of healing because adrenaline makes you do freaky shit man thats when you hear the stories about lb women lifting a car when the body is under stress that extreme it can push past a lot of things plus she was shown as struggling later the problem is that this sub is stagnating and the more it stagnates the worse it gets people get caught up in their theories and forget that theyre just theories and wouldnt work well they criticize what the writers do because theyre pretentious and dont want to acknowledge that they dont have the answers and sincrber dont know how the storyline for her ends up in twow we dont know if this happens too but even if grrm did it the same way itd just have so much more subtle nuances and would be praised tldr none of this shit is out of character for arya yall need to get off the high horses
asoiaf,removed,this is a watershed week the show has been getting away with plot and dialog murder for a long time but the arya plot is the one where people finally said enough likewise in our own game of thrones trump has been getting away with blathering hateful nonsense for almost a year but the curiel debacle finally opened up the floodgates of universal condemnation better late than never i say
asoiaf,removed,they want to make sansa look like a g after spending a tad bit of time with littlefinger but then say arya doesnt learn shit after an extended period of time with the faceless fuck you dd
asoiaf,removed,apparently according to leaked spoilers he bends the knee to the boltons and helps fight with them against the starks only halfway through he changes sides and starts attacking the bolton army
asoiaf,removed,logic get out of here with that tonight is about how the writing is lazy and dd are baby eating nazis and how this was the worst episode evercue comic book guy voice seriously the jerking about this episode is on par with the dorne circlejerking thats been happening for an eternity it wasnt the best episode but it certainly wasnt horrible either
asoiaf,removed,yeah the anally retentive
asoiaf,removed,no you have to be overwhelmed by dds incredible perfomance and ask for more danny epic speeches or get banned choose wisely
asoiaf,removed,uhhh no shit but neither costume time mean any significant passage of time passed arya changed out of her bloody clothes the waif changed clothes to disguise herself whats the point of this thread aside from stating the obvious
asoiaf,removed,its confirmed to be wildfire in the leaks we already got the high sparrows past in a recent episode think before you post
asoiaf,removed,thats a lot of bullshit coming directly from the time you live in where ideal tends to dictate every single life to be considered absolutely precious no matter what which disregards morality completely living under lannister or bolton government fine as long as we saved the men that would have died opposing them what of the men suffering under their rule what of the men dying under their rule leaving the future of westerosi civilization to them fine were saving a lot more people this way s id like you to make the same comments about nazi germany how anyone taking a stand against them against all odds were idiots with too much pride how every man who died fighting in battle were just a waste if their side didnt win the war
asoiaf,removed,just stop watching if you get so sad about a single episode lmao float yourself please
asoiaf,removed,the episode discussion thread was such a person has read all four books at lest times
asoiaf,removed,i cant see anything other than cersei burning down kl now or at least the sept something i posted a few weeks back
asoiaf,removed,i love coming on here and reading all the fedora tippers yelling terrible writing with doritos crumbs still laced in their pubey beards this is a fantasy show where a guy was brought to life and dragons eat people shut the fuck up i dont see any of you jabronis writing for an awardwinning show oh wait thats right youre all a bunch of keyboard jockeys with liberal arts degrees comparing your page essay on dantes inferno that got you an a in enc to a script written by legitimately talented writers lmao
asoiaf,removed,thanks that dude is a real creep
asoiaf,removed,shit post theyre not rushing anything its a different medium shes been on her way back to mereen for episodes and its shit story telling so tired of the whiny complaints people have about the dumbest shit
asoiaf,removed,this post was removed for being rude and condescending about groups of fans a violation of our httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikicivilitypolicy and our httpswwwredditcomrasoiafaboutrules

asoiaf,removed,how do asians name their children by dropping silverware down the stairs i am a bot to summon me include tell me a joke somewhere in your message
asoiaf,removed,my guesses by seasons end ep dany and drogon fight off masters ironborn arrive and finish them off in the north davos finds shireens grave jon attempts to fight ramsay on who declines rickon is shot by ramsay and killed battle ensues smalljon is killed by tormund in on wildlings start to die and get closed in on when the knights of the vale arrive and save the day they push the bolton forces back wun wun breaks down the doors to winterfell but is killed by ramsay with a narrow to the eye jon beats ramsay almost to death but spares him ep bwb and hound capture brienne and storm the frey castle killing them all and capturing jaime dany speaks with ironborn about ships and sailing for westeros idk if itll just but yara and theon or if euron shows up her arc ends with her setting sail jon and sansa kill ramsay by letting his dogsghost eat him sansa confronts littlefinger jon is proclaimed king of the north pycelle and kevan killed by qyburns little birds marg loras tommen high sparrow and several others wait for cersei to appear at her trial she chooses not to and unleashes wildfire killing loras marg mace high sparrow countless tyrell soldiers and faith militia and so on mountain and her escape qyburn killed while escaping tommen retreats into the throne room to escape wildfire and commits suicide by jumping out a window bran sees tower of joy flashback revealing jon to be stark and targaryen benjen tells him to go south of the wall and escape the others varys arrives in dorne makes arrangements to gain the sandsnakes help and ensure dany sits on the throne jorah finds red preistess who heals him he begins his trek back to westeros after hearing dany has left white walkers arrive at the wall they use magi to break it down edd and remaining nights watch are slaughtered
asoiaf,removed,sorry for my wrong word speak orwellian master in all seriousness retarded has taken on two completely different meanings one in the colloquial sense and the other in a medical sense one meaning describes someone who is acting like an idiot and the other calling someone mentally deficient another example of this is the word fag some people use it to call people idiots and others use it to offend gay people it doesnt always carry emotional bagging it depends on the context in which the word is used i call my friends fags all the time am i a homophobe god no i have zero problems with gay people anyway i know you dont care but i am a big believer in the old mantra sticks and stones may break my bones but words may never hurt me that is how i got over being bullied as a kid if words affect you that much you need to develop a thicker skin because unless you suppose we started going full orwellian and start policing language you are going to be hearing that word a lot more than what you want to hear especially on the internet
asoiaf,removed,theres a theory going around that theres a frey party scene we still havent seen yet in the trailers and it is when arya enacts her revenge on walder poison frey forceslannister forces begin heading home and the bwb strike the same night that arya does at either the twins or riverrun while they are vastly outnumbered i could see the show having them sneak past the soldiersarmies of each side and into the castle main hall where the damage is done that being said storming the castle was exactly the wrong terminology to use on my part
asoiaf,removed,uh yeah maybe we had a better vocabulary in the because that was a pretty common year old insult where im from makes me want to pull a im rubber your glue outta my pocket lol but whatever makes you feel ok about everyone being allowed their own opinion obviously you have an issue with differing ideas good luck with that
asoiaf,removed,well then i disagree with the subs policy however i understand that this is not a privately owned website and i will adhere to the subs policies from now on in terms of the argument that i made i believe it is perfectly valid context is everything but as i said if its this subs policies i will change my wording
asoiaf,removed,you are a talker i hate talkers mostly because you wrote a long wall of text without really making a point
asoiaf,removed,hes like the trump of got
asoiaf,removed,oh a karma whoring thread nice
asoiaf,removed,lol someone called me a retard for saying the same thing occams razor rules the show and all quality narratives obviously ruling out that syrio forel was really dead but jaqen stole his face kept it cracked until and used it to kill the waif and save arya i was called a retard for saying occams razor dismisses retardedly complex theories
asoiaf,removed,easy way to get that comment karma right cause people interested in a lsh thread arent going to know the rest of that scene right
asoiaf,removed,leads me to think the high sparrow isnt religious at heart but completely a player in the game yes every holier than thou movement leader is just another player in the game the only difference is how effective they are at pr and marjory is one of the best ps sorry bernie bros
asoiaf,removed,in other words dicks enjoy it

asoiaf,removed,are you pretending to be confused the waif has been aryas key antagonist since she arrived at the house of black and white arya is abandoning her fm training to return to westeros any good story has to resolve the conflict between the or risk loose plot threads the death of the waif ends their story and leads to the end of aryas time in bravos

asoiaf,removed,no not really i mean he was trained by a skilled masterofarms no doubt but his brother tygett was the warrior in the family when he served in the war of the ninepenny kings it was in his friend aerys personal retinue so i doubt they saw much fighting he was just really intelligent and a ruthless leader is all trying to keep the realm together while aerys daydreamed must have been a nightmare
asoiaf,removed,you know i always hated this as a stupid meme but we really do need a new book
asoiaf,removed,i think tommen might kill himself he even sounds like a person with selfesteem problems probably will jump out of a window
asoiaf,removed,also the melisandre reveal and the jon snow reveal the hound reveal the mountain reveal nope dont think so
asoiaf,removed,cersei reminds me of hillary
asoiaf,removed,you sound like a retard when you write like this

asoiaf,removed,not gonna happen you can read more in the megathread but ill just say that its pretty fuckin bad
asoiaf,removed,find me three recent posts theorizng stannis is alive and ill find you posts whining about these people created within the last hours fuck ive seen four in this post alone the circlejerk has come full circle and your bitching is no less annoying than their nonexistent blind belief in stannis being alive the only difference is theyre actually contributing and youre wasting space telling us how tired you are of things we never see
asoiaf,removed,youre not very bright
asoiaf,removed,if that really is arya its shitty writing like arrow level shitty
asoiaf,removed,goodness you have a complete lack of iq dont you i said if something happens itll be shitty writing no need to act like i gravely insulted your entire family

asoiaf,removed,makes iron islands great again
asoiaf,removed,cersei she was married off to a guy who loved another after the guy she dreamed of marrying all her life ran off with the same woman and the two men causing a war over said woman she was the first born but last in line to inherit anything from her family even after the imp coming in second was the story of her life and im sure many people can relate she did some really bad things but the people around her werent any better people just sometimes better at hiding their true intent i was somehow happy for her when she blew up all her enemies in the sept because she mustve lived in constant fear for a long time and now she might finally feel safe it was the only option to get out of the whole mess alive i dont respect her for the choices she made because lots of it is really her fault but i can understand why she was so desperate to make these choices
asoiaf,removed,did anyone else read this in trumps voice
asoiaf,removed,a lot of show watchers are idiots
asoiaf,removed,haha yes the falia thing would probably not fly so well with the casual audience
asoiaf,removed,so even after grrm repeatedly confirms that cat had only one bad incident with jon when she was traumatised after brans fall sexist people on this sub have to keep on repeating this lie people like you are why reddit has this bad rep on the internet you will latch on to a female character in any series and demonise them to any extent even though there are plenty of characters in the series who commit blunder after blunder and are mean you will still hate the female character more because why not
asoiaf,removed,i wish the show would have done this but from jons position we would have had this huge question of faith with jon spit in the face of the old gods by burning their trees or try and win the fight in any way you kind it would have been an excellent moral dilemma instead we got utter nonsense from the battle of the bastards beautiful nonsense dont get me wrong but nonsense nonetheless
asoiaf,removed,hodorhodorhodorniggerhodor
asoiaf,removed,oh sorry i forgot logic is banned by the preston jacobites
asoiaf,removed,maybe its because im new reddit and just dont get it yet but not sure why this is being down voted shes done porn and it wouldnt be the first on set relationship
asoiaf,removed,except he never was he was bathed in a furnace wind except he absolutely was when he raised his whip he saw that the lash was burning his hand as well all of him all of him was burning why lie why prove my point about the utter pathetic weakness of this joke of a theory by blatantly omitting the literal words describing first the whip then quentyn on fire oh right you do it because the theory is trash you have to make such omissions or else the theory falls apart if both dany and quentyn got hit by the same thing then why cant quentyn survive too dany never looks at her own arm and describes it as burning the same way the whip she is holding is burning you know why she didnt get bathed in dragon fire quentyn did except for the fact that the only guy who actually got roasted by any dragon was a random crossbowman yeah nah as i literally pointed you omitted the one guy who is bathed in fire and is dragged out alive again because doing so is the only way this travesty of a theory can hold water and the corpse in barristans chapter is specifically noted to have burst eyes and is missing most of its face again you lie about what the text says the text describes quentyns skin as sloughed away heres a lovely little special important definition you apparently dont know slough verb past tense sloughed past participle sloughed shed or remove a layer of dead skin firstly barristan can see quentyns skull if you have the capacity to do so reread your quote about the crossbowman and acknowledge that the skin on his face is not sloughed away rather his neck is bitten the amazing difference between those two things having your neck bitten and having the skin on your head slough away to reveal your skull is staggering yet again for this weak stupid theory you ignore it wow literally every point youve made so far are literal lies and omission of facts great theory kiddo and last we saw quentyn he had specifically shielded his eyes and they were still working just fine and the chapter cuts off right then we dont see completion of events and thus your concluding that quentyn covering his eyes is proof he is alive is now misrepresentation and outright fairytale quentyn never demonstrably got struck by dragon fire in his chapter yes he did he literally describes his own arm on fire the only person who did get struck by dragon fire in the chapter is the crossbowman a weak lie proven wrong already what quentyn did get struck by was rhaegals furnace wind something that dany earlier in the same book gets struck by from drogon yet shes still alive and well its utter misrepresentation to again omit the fact that quentyn describes himself on fire the corpse of quentyn matches the description of the crossbowman that viserion roasted right down to specific details while it doesnt match what we know happened to quentyn again a weak lie that defies the actual text describing the crossbowman as having his neck ripped out which barristan fails utterly to describe about the dying prince he does see in fact ill straight up say we literally see that crossbowman die on page in quentyns chapter making it literally impossible for you to reasonably conclude that maybe the day slow dying charred corpse was in fact not quentyn its impossible for that day dying corpse to be the crossbowman because the day dying corpse was alive for three days while the crossbowman dies in a pov right for us to read you can choose to not like the theory thats perfectly fine but to say its one of the worst theories youve ever seen is complete overkill theres tons of evidence that the corpse wasnt quentyn no there isnt there is no evidence that the corpse wasnt quentyn absolutely unequivocally none all there is is a weak theory supported by omitting lines and outright lying and misrepresenting others you can like it all you want but you better be prepared to have your opinion shredded given its a shit opinion founded on nothing but weak weak lies deal with it kiddo quentyn is as dead as the shit theory that he isnt
asoiaf,removed,the books show shat the riverlanders hate northerners for pillaging their lands ill wait for the quotes that show the riverlanders hate the northerners ill wait for you to post that one quote of one person who says wolves and lions are the same and then ill wait for you to ignore the fact that it was roose bolton who sent the bloody mummers back out into the riverlanders and that the karstarks are the only northerners roaming the riverlands without leave

asoiaf,removed,if you havent read the most recent euron chapter euron impregnates falys flowers cuts her tongue out and binds her to the prow of his ship along with aeron hes an absolutely horrible suitor since the closer you are to euron the more likely you are to experience tortureabuse hes killed of his brothers tortured and mutilated a fourth aeron can no longer use his legs sent the fifth halfway around the world on a fools errand and apparently used a maester to ensure that victarions wound would fester euron does not have a good track record when it comes to dealing with his immediate family
asoiaf,removed,no stannis was a scumbag usurper who was put down by the warden of the north ramsay bolton
asoiaf,removed,he tells them hell make iron islands great again that kind of speech doesnt need many reality to gain voters

asoiaf,removed,average doesnt mean minimum like you believe average means that many of them were younger congratulations you fail both history and math
asoiaf,removed,if you had bothered to read the first linked article youd know that in in england as part of the rape law the statute of westminster made it a misdemeanour to ravish a maiden within age whether with or without her consent the phrase within age was interpreted by jurist sir edward coke as meaning the age of marriage which at the time was years this was medieval england not englishistan
asoiaf,removed,nobody cares about your reading difficulties
asoiaf,removed,because hes gonna build a wall
asoiaf,removed,because he keeps proving the theorists wrong at first they thought hed run to the east and be easily defeated by their chosen yet highly flawed queen those that thought hed stay in westeros believed hed never make it through the bottleneck of the redwyne straits that their galleys naval experience and firepower not to mention his challengers among the ironborn would create a ceiling on what he could achieve he defeated them all by a wide margin they thought a bookish nerd like rodrik harlaw could stand a chance against him just because of his vast wealth and last name they entertained the idea of a fringe religious figure leading a revolt against him among the base because of his lack of godly credentials the drowned men remain subdued even the great victarion whose wife euron personally attacked and who still commands a wide following among those who believe in the old way has submitted to eurons leadership when they failed they thought a young man with a well established name experience against the others and ties to wildling integration could take him out with a well aimed shot from a weirwood bow when the contest began in earnest at oldtown that man repeated the same attack four times before being defeated in his own homeland and may never return to the order he once served in four years will anyone even remember samwell tarly eurons appeal among the fandom is that he is new and that he knows how to use magic and dragons to inspire and control people something the last generation of old way fiscally iron priced ironborn candidates have never understood maybe hell even have a shot at defeating daenerys bending the knee to aegon is wasting your sword littlefinger does that man even know where astapor is theres an arrest warrant out for sansa besides euron who else is there to support to prevent daenerys from taking the iron throne
asoiaf,removed,if there were going to be an book we are probably going to need a heart transplant for george

asoiaf,removed,this one also have transcriptions and the notes of the one that were read in conventions and stuff
asoiaf,removed,that theory you had yeah its not really his style hed make it more nuanced grey and less obvious maybe you should stick to something less morally advanced like lotr or harry potter so that everything fits into the blackandwhite box you live in
asoiaf,removed,i dont know they way that he had faegon raised makes me think that he wouldnt he has lived with fisherfolk worked with his hands swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need he can fish and cook and bind up a wound he knows what it is like to be hungry to be hunted to be afraid tommen has been taught that kingship is his right aegon knows kingship is his duty that a king must put his people first and live and rule for them dwdw epilogue varys wants a leader who looks after the interests of the little people and understands the needs of the poor and exploited a king like that would raise taxes on the richest to pay for medicare and early education programs
asoiaf,removed,those arent the same thing at all stannis is a living claimant to the throne and joffrey was a bastard of incest jon is the last male heir of the starks as far as everybody is aware even if he is a bastard

asoiaf,removed,try to keep the tone civil
asoiaf,removed,so you believe what he tells robert wow its not even worth replying to you the whole point of making jon his bastard was to hide him from robert in fact him telling robert its wylla is more proof of rlj because he only tells robert that to throw off any suspicion why else discuss it with robert but not his own wife also he was known to have a huge crush on ashara dayne but he fathers jon on a servant at house dayne instead godric borell says jons mother is a fishwife why not believe him

asoiaf,removed,good bears ser twenty of house goodmen
asoiaf,removed,im with you my good man dont let to in the sub get you down
asoiaf,removed,heres a resolution stop watching the show

asoiaf,removed,congress does not require desire on the womans part ive been saying this for years
asoiaf,removed,gagnonca used waaaaah its not very effective
asoiaf,removed,lsh would be the only one to order thoros to kill innocents beric would never and beric wasnt said to be returning but thoros is
asoiaf,removed,congress does not require desire on the womans part bill cosby high sparroe
asoiaf,removed,and nigger and every other insult is ok in my vocabulary so everything must be great of course sexist male white redditors will make up vocabularies which suit them
asoiaf,removed,he refused treatment nigga probably got fucking aids from that dirty ass bloody as fuck arakh
asoiaf,removed,thats bc its a shit opinion
asoiaf,removed,waaaah the fan fiction i predicted didnt happen and it was so much better than what other people wanted why doesnt this multimillion dollar production cater to my whim
asoiaf,removed,why do you want her dead what did she ever do to deserve that
asoiaf,removed,dude no joke there are some people on this sub with some fucking retarded ideas guarantee theyre the same retards that complain about heavyhanded and handholding narratives
asoiaf,removed,i love ethnically ambiguous panderrap
asoiaf,removed,im telling on youwaaaahhhh dont be a cry baby
asoiaf,removed,hate to break it to you butriponeofthemsoon
asoiaf,removed,totally one small gripe u can tell she wasnt into the titty kissing scene just little pecks i wanted to see her suck that titty i hope i dont get banned for this vulgar desire
asoiaf,removed,youre a fuckwit
asoiaf,removed,episode was way to short i thought the hound scenes were well done most redeeming quality of the episode was the lack of a certain blonde bitch with dragons blackfish scene where he tells them to kill edmure was great arya getting stabbed over and over was a bad call would have prefered a slash stab then the waif dumping her off the bridge and end the episode with that scene
asoiaf,removed,well you dont seem understand why its pointless youll find out why in episode
asoiaf,removed,its like the feminists in europe who want to invite in a bunch of muslims rape and murder will ensue but it gives them power for a little while so theyre okay with it
asoiaf,removed,i remember my first beer
asoiaf,removed,i mean tommen has to die somehow margaery stops sleeping with him and he jumps out of the red keep and although his very swollen and large balls absorb the brunt impact they explode and the pure shock kills him
asoiaf,removed,i didnt reveal any spoiler i didnt even give any indication nor direction as to the events that will take place
asoiaf,removed,it isnt even a spoiler where is the spoiler does telling someone to find out why in episode count as a spoiler now because im pretty sure theres zero amount of spoiler in that comment
asoiaf,removed,nigga said aisha lol
asoiaf,removed,yeah jon will whip out the longclaw for her to see and of course she wouldve want it but dont want to want it just like ygritte
asoiaf,removed,look at episode description before being a smartass
asoiaf,removed,i hated it
asoiaf,removed,downvoted for wasting bandwidth
asoiaf,removed,he has made some overtures about being a father and calling tommen our son he didnt care much not that he didnt care at all and of course he acknowledged that tommen is his son that doesnt mean he was feeling strongly about it im sorry but thats just the way its portrayed you constantly see cersei referring to and talking about her children you dont get the same with jamie nor was jamie nearly as heartbroken as cersei yes he was still sad but its not comparable and i disagree him stagnating is good writing its not stagnating if what im saying turns out to be true its called being set up they cant suddenly have him do a turn on cersei theyre still reinforcing the fact that he does love her so when they do split itll be more impactful i disagree with the regression of jamie back to season where he was aerys bitch and now is cerseis bitch just because he still likes cersei doesnt mean he regressed back to season while he was traveling with brienne he was still in love with cersei by your logic he would also be regressing there thats obviously not true he still went through that arc and his development is still there he acknowledges hes not a warrior anymore as bronn pointed out and he still would have outheld the oath of bringing sansa and arya back if he had them that isnt backpeddling just because theres one aspect of his character that hasnt changedyet he truly savours other peoples suffering if its for cersei when has he ever shown to be in delight of other peoples suffering youre just making stuff up now its quite clear from your tone and your blatant lie that you cant really be objective about his character in the show im going to end this here as i know from past experience that if people cant be objective then the discussion ends up going no where like really he enjoys suffering in the name of cersei now wont read your next response because its probably just going to be more silly
asoiaf,removed,fuck off you piece of shit
asoiaf,removed,what a bunch of bullshit
asoiaf,removed,watch mad men breaking bad the wire or even the newsroom and tell me monologues are boring thats the attitude i would expect from a frat bro dude their arent enough tits
asoiaf,removed,i really hate that cunts smug face
asoiaf,removed,true story my exwife confessed to her priest she told me this that she was struggling in the marriage and he advised her to be a good wife serve her husband as god wanted her to to please her husband i listened with a straight face but inside i was like yes so youre going to do that right we are going to fuck more than once per month and your going to stop bitching about everything yeah she didnt she decided she hated being married to me because a guy with a job who didnt smoke drink or gamble but likes to play some video games and ride his bike is a real asshole therefore exwife but yeah priests sometimes do say that stuff
asoiaf,removed,your friend is stupid
asoiaf,removed,game of thrones episode the hype awakens
asoiaf,removed,too bad you get hype and stabbing
asoiaf,removed,why is it crazy either something is done well or it is not and if multiple people feel that some things take them out of the show immersion and even causal viewers complain about jet packs it is definitely not well done but go ahead please circlejerk about the show that is what this sub has become
asoiaf,removed,everyone save this line and use it to smack over the face of the people who constantly complain about jet packs and teleporting it is pathetic what this sub has become a constant show circlekerk where bullies like you gang up against anyone who says one single point against the show and i would not be surprised if some of you were not in hbos pay because there is no way there is so much venom against people who make a single complain of course you also do not have the intelligence to understand that if multiple people are complaining about something it is not well done at all even if you make a million excuses for it when something makes you laugh at a serious scene takes you out of the immersion of the show makes even casual viewers joke about jet packs then that thing is very poorly done but go ahead bully anyone who has a single complain about the show many book readers have stopped posting here and many have left because of bullying of people like you just look at how anyone who has replied to your points has been downvoted got is a show only forum but this sub has become a poor cousin to it
asoiaf,removed,i think so too lol i hope so aswell
asoiaf,removed,you do not complain about the show on this sub you just do not you will just be bullied an downvoted no matter how decently you try to debate this sub is a show circlejerk for a while now with bullies or those in hbo pay running rampant
asoiaf,removed,your friend is retarded
asoiaf,removed,yeah but would it honestly have made for good tv for most viewers well not for viewers httpiimgurcomljckjjegif evidently
asoiaf,removed,lady stone heart more like lady stone cunt
asoiaf,removed,most girls from a certain demo or social status are bisexual or just dont mind fooling with girls at parties
asoiaf,removed,in this instance i was merely stating that there are viewersas uhrithgarcyning who apparently prefer dd material more as the particular scene of the show linked here then again there are others who prefer the original material more it is unclear to me what the violation is
asoiaf,removed,okay we get it you read the spoilers dont spoil it for others by pretending like you came up with this theory
asoiaf,removed,this was my big question if rljsansa a femalerickon from spoilers i read is going to die and bran unlikely but possibleto procreateandbei g eyed raven and all who will take the mantle at house stark my guess it would have to be john being legitimized some how house stark is dead gave me chills
asoiaf,removed,link
asoiaf,removed,girls who are more sexual promiscuous than the average will recreation ally have sex or less with the same sex
asoiaf,removed,i wish donald trump would reveal himself as a terrifying wizard pirate it would certainly shake the cycle up a little bit
asoiaf,removed,for some odd reason i read with like a trump speech
asoiaf,removed,didnt some dude post a ton of similar spoilers at the start of the season but withheld what happened in episode i wish he just went all out and told us everything keep up the good work you are doing the work of the old gods and the new
asoiaf,removed,this potential future spoilers obviously
asoiaf,removed,so is no one else going to ask why a random site called quirkybyte with godawful formatting is being trusted as the sole source of this info
asoiaf,removed,there was some leaked info about the trial not happening cerseis got other ideas
asoiaf,removed,so you havent even read the books yourself fuck off im so sick of these bran theories from people who havent even picked up a book what if bran warhead into the nights king what if bran went back in time and warhead into khal forgo to kill dannys brother coz he was actually the real king to be what if bran warged into reek back in time and killed ramsey what if bran warged into jamie and didnt push himself out a window what if bran warged into tyrion to get him to build him a saddle what if bran warged into see how stupidly easy that is to do its literally mental diarrhea the bran stuff on the show has made fan theories on the net absolutely shitty online with all the show watchers chiming in with their limited knowledge and bogus what if endless shit
asoiaf,removed,piracy my friend
asoiaf,removed,but it has to refer to the zombies be iiiii thought of it op
asoiaf,removed,maybe just maybe many fan theories are in some way correct because fans spend countless hours theorizing plot elements we are approaching the end of the series so when long held fan theories end up being true dont go whining that its fan service when in reality its part of the story that was correctly guessed by hardcore fans of the series the show just cant fucking when with some people i wish i had enough poison for the whole pack of you
asoiaf,removed,everyone laugh at ukentrel worst episode ever neckbeards are the worst
asoiaf,removed,i think your theory is stupid no better than the bran time traveling crap
asoiaf,removed,grrm spends time detailing all the physical similarities of a seemingly unimportant dude have you not read the books
asoiaf,removed,i know im gonna get downvoted for this but i think itd be cool if jon snow kills ramsay
asoiaf,removed,you could also chose not to read this subreddit if youre afraid of hearing opinions you dont like
asoiaf,removed,wow i guess she takes after her character that is a serious bitch move
asoiaf,removed,heres a challenge for you go through all your posts and find one that isnt just going against the flow
asoiaf,removed,you shut the fuck up
asoiaf,removed,go watch network tv then you idiot
asoiaf,removed,except for the fact that most people ive interacted with here and in the real world seem to rate this season as one of the best viewership is higher than it has ever been critics have also had a high opinion of this season and fans seem to be loving it as well if you dont like it thats perfectly fine youre entitled to your opinion but youre trying to convince people that the show is bad because you dont like it even though most viewers and critics seem to think that its good the show is an absolute pop culture phenomenon and you are trying to tell us that it is bad because you dont like what theyve done with some characters
asoiaf,removed,by the way shouting fan service at the end of each of your posts is hardly a quality way to have an actual conversation your opinion is already made up and youre clearly not trying to engage in a dialogue youre simply talking down to everyone else being condescending and combative makes for a shitty discussion
asoiaf,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot

asoiaf,removed,so youre expecting him to pull a trump
asoiaf,removed,of course theyre fake a queen comes forth we all know that jon will retake winterfell and well witness an inversion of the yaraasha iron islands scene with theon
asoiaf,removed,my autist alarm is going off here
asoiaf,removed,please go fuck yourself
asoiaf,removed,i have watch episode yesterday
asoiaf,removed,it would be hilarious that that guy thinks muslims cleanlinessobsessed icondestroying citybuilding muslims have anything in common with dothraki if it werent also terrifying islam is the one thing that finally pacified the constant waves of central asian hordes
asoiaf,removed,i figured battle of the bastards meant ramseyjon houndmountain and danyeuron
asoiaf,removed,wow thanks shithead i havent been able to watch the episode yer and you just spoiled it use tags faggot
asoiaf,removed,i apologize i was unclear in this case yeah i have no idea what youre talking about but i trust you to be right yeah i suck dick as a hobby good the world needs more amateur cocksuckers its like sure some people do it professionaly but what is money compared to doing something out of love for the art of it people should look up to us deep south your grace what english isnt my first language what the fuck does that mean
asoiaf,removed,there are spoiler tags for a reason fucking use them
asoiaf,removed,fuck you nigger lover hodor on my cock so the cum stays in
asoiaf,removed,of course she would seem brilliant to you youre a turd
asoiaf,removed,im ready for the serious discussion threads to be legitimate serious discussion and not turn into a comment joke that ill probably see regurgitated in another thread ffs when i click on serious discussion i want paragraphs of input not snarky one liners you faggots
asoiaf,removed,sansa wont be queen of the north shes retarded and mentally incapable she just wants to go home and chill for the winter she has no idea what war is only ramseys dick size
asoiaf,removed,jorah dies in ep
asoiaf,removed,sansa is incompetent that was clear from the start she showed absolute lack of honor when she lied about aryajoff fight she betrayed her father when she told cercei about her fathers plans she let lf kill her aunt who was protecting her she was woman who lacked empathy and treated arya and jon like shit in a way she totally deserved the ramsays rape now there is not doubt about the following mistakes she should have kept brienne close to her at all times she should have ideally killed off lf at moles town and then gone to vale she should have told davos and jon about vale troops she should not have trusted lf
asoiaf,removed,thank you zombiejesus i now see the error of my ways i will no longer question any hype posts nor tinfoil i bend the knee to those who propose actual relevant ideas and those who propose the most retarded shit ever to see the light of day
asoiaf,removed,hi guy who takes random comical comment in game of thrones thread way too seriously
asoiaf,removed,saw a similar thread after the episode was aired nice finding you did
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,pretty sure what littlefinger wants as a reward sansa can give for free over and over wink
asoiaf,removed,so what he gives people heals and buffs with his magic butthole
asoiaf,removed,good theory but i dont think the understudy could have held character while being stabbed let alone have the mental capacity to jump into a river and swim at length out of sight under water and then run through the crowd without telling someone what was going down
asoiaf,removed,good theory but i dont think the understudy could have held character while being stabbed let alone have the mental capacity to jump into a river and swim at length out of sight under water and then run through the crowd without telling someone what was going down
asoiaf,removed,lol and you know this how trust me despite your trendy rainbows and unicorn assumption of these situations described by oprah and degeneres complicated holdhouses are complicated
asoiaf,removed,a super dumb idea concocted under the influence of tinfoil
asoiaf,removed,salty cunt well see in the next three weeks
asoiaf,removed,this is where we discuss why it wasnt arya who got stabbed wasnt shaggydogs head on the table the umbers are going to turn on ramsay right
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,my main frustration is theres endless downvoting of people who clearly arent that wellversed as many others and innocently dont know certain facts how dare you i demand the right to downvote people who dont instinctively know that mychel redfort married waymar royces sister on a more serious note youre right im sick of people getting downvoted for asking reasonable questions or even worse raising unorthodox opinions i mean bran will be the reason why hodorhodor is way more outlandish than a lot of the stuff that picks up downvotes
asoiaf,removed,maybe bookmark this link
asoiaf,removed,this is the real reason im so hyped for what this guy did at hardhome was great hope this season it will involve some ww too but what truede said we wont see anymore ww this season for once i hope hes not right
asoiaf,removed,yeah thats the stupidest fucking logic ive ever heard the head of the fm is going to allow himself to be killed by a trainee so that he can give her a lesson so he can find arya and tell her a secret theres literally no reason why jaqen would disguise himself as arya get himself stabbed by the waif and then stumble through the streets hoping that he manages to get to arya in time to tell her something
asoiaf,removed,except this just as well applies to the book so fuck off
asoiaf,removed,clutching at straws
asoiaf,removed,lol yer wrong sorry race doesnt just mean color why do you think hitler exterminated the jews and went to war against the ussr because he hated the jewish and slavic races he was ok with the english because he thought the anglosaxon race was decent and a natural ally for the germanic race within the context of the show given the cultural differences between the wildlings and the rest of the realm v little andal influence and next to zero interbreeding between them and the realm i think its fair to think of wildlings as a distinct race
asoiaf,removed,and yet both beric and lady stoneheart lead men and people dont run away from them even though lady stoneheart is way more fucked up than jon this guy just wants to rip on the show for no reason
asoiaf,removed,are wheat done yet with these puns
asoiaf,removed,are wheat done yet with these puns
asoiaf,removed,hurt durr muh book
asoiaf,removed,i pray youre right and yeah thats my fault dont know the world to call your dads wifes nephew and assume rlj youre uncles wifes nephew but yeah also i feel like now that jon is no longer a man of the nights watch that robbs will should come into play and i could forgive a lot if the manderlys suddenly show up and say robb legitimized u dawg ur a stark bra and we will fight for u dawg also i have to believe dragons cost a lot more to show than dire wolvesshouldnt ghost be like with jon and wouldnt that maybe help his negotiations if he had ghost with him and was all like listen glover you oath breaking sack of shit i will have my dire wolf rape your wife once we are done with the boltons
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,if grrm finishes the book series before he dies i will jerk myself off with a running chainsaw on webcam
asoiaf,removed,how much debt are you taking on to learn these valuable life skills
asoiaf,removed,probably banging one of the other cast members
asoiaf,removed,that is going to be so gay if it ever happens
asoiaf,removed,if some dumb shit like that actually happened i would legitimately consider packing up and leaving the series for good last thing i want is another christopher paolini and his super badass army of cat people that only want to be paid in milk and mice
asoiaf,removed,you wrote that and honestly didnt think to yourself gee that sounds a tad too moronic and childish for asoiaf
asoiaf,removed,i said doggos because calling people dogfags usually gets you banned
asoiaf,removed,thats cause its a crap thread people getting all hot and bothered about the thought of a few hundred wolves somehow miraculously killing armies of thousands of armed armored and trained soldiers
asoiaf,removed,giants riding mammoths mance wouldnt have done a weak attack just to test the walls strength hed have immediately hit them with everything he had i wouldnt write them off so easily the wall had been attacked by kings beyond the wall many times before but never with the cohesion that mance was able to bring
asoiaf,removed,well its not a very interesting alternative reality if the same thing just happens again is it stannis was able to lead a surprise flank attack during a break in the fighting which the northern wouldnt be able to do
asoiaf,removed,well the south would have turned out a bit different stannis sent his letters to every lord in the realm after ned was executed saying he would not make the same mistake that ned did though i imagine regardless stannis would have still sent his letters but perhaps what with neds confession being accepted fewer would have believed stannis not that many did anyway if he had still murdered renly and marched on kings landing the lannisters would have been garrisoned and ready for him this does of course mean stannis doesnt get taken by surprise and tyrion would never have been hotk meaning no wildfire plot its hard to say maybe stannis would have won his siege if hed been able to get the tyrells or dorne on his side
asoiaf,removed,i dont think ser alliser would have had the balls really and once ned was at the wall it could quickly become evident to everyone that he was the honourable man they had all previously thought things would get interesting when janos slynt showed up though
asoiaf,removed,i dont think this is entirely accurate though obvioisly all speculation the end of this is presuming stannis would not still help in the north which i do not understand due to the fact that his involvement in the north had jothing to do with who was there other than davos reading a letter that was sent but that letter still would have been sent just maybe not by jon
asoiaf,removed,i dont think this is true stannis is a man who believes in all lw and according to law all crimes are forgiven and forgotten when taking the black melisandre would still have been with stannis when he got the letter and her and davos are the reason he went north not because of who sent it
asoiaf,removed,ten thousand men at the wall and youre saying it would fall dude jon snow held the wall at castle black with a hundred times fewer men than that a dozen or so men held a tunnel against the mightiest of the giants based on what we know ten thousand men could fully man the wall lord commander hoare had as many men with all castles staffed three hundred years ago obviously due to the small time frame you propose this would be impossible no time to fix the ruined castles but that still doesnt make mances attacks successful mance has barely ten times as many people as the army at the wall his real fighters are less than twenty or thirty thousand including mammoths and giants and on the wall a man is equal to a hundred below the wildlings have no chance
asoiaf,removed,he would have died with yoren when the lannisters sent men to find gendry
asoiaf,removed,fully agree now way the wildlings could breach a fully manned wall a strong army of westerosi souldiers probably couldnt breach the wall from the nort if the wall was manned with men
asoiaf,removed,you can tell who is a show only fan by the lack of reading comprehension
asoiaf,removed,exactly so this is a place for people who have both read the books and watched the show if youve only watched the show you should be on rgameofthrones
asoiaf,removed,in addition to just being a twat this guy seems to think that ambiguity only exists on paper
asoiaf,removed,you definitely can but like you dont have to to validate your intellectual capacity
asoiaf,removed,oh man what went down here like removed posts from civility violation lol
asoiaf,removed,cersei is kinda the trump of the asoiafuniverse
asoiaf,removed,then dont be dumb
asoiaf,removed,most of them probably masturbated at least
asoiaf,removed,you can discuss without arguing you can disagree without being an asshole
asoiaf,removed,yeesh wish i looked at your comment history before engaging with you my mistake homophobia mocking the mentally handicapped and misogyny youre not secretly donald trump are you
asoiaf,removed,these sort of post titles are
asoiaf,removed,quentyn is aliveshut up preston
asoiaf,removed,to you i think she can a great arc but shes gonna die and live her second life its not just so sansa can have a wolf you dullard
asoiaf,removed,ctrlshiftn man ctrlshiftn
asoiaf,removed,dont spam your shitty youtube channel here
asoiaf,removed,hes an idiot
asoiaf,removed,haha dont even try convincing one of the sansa haters they dont seem to be able to be empathetic to others at all can only sympathise with other intjs like them ie stannis
asoiaf,removed,sansa may look like catelyn but in character she is ned come again this is the stupidest thing ive ever read on this forum sansa imitates catelyn and the bad parts of catelyn were she like ned she wouldnt look down on jon she wouldnt betray her sister because her current senpai is a queen with lots of pretty bling in her hair and she wouldnt generally be a stupid whiny bitch who values appearance over substance as in the way she liked joffrey shes shallow and stupid and i believe a young catelyn might have had a touch of that as well but then with the war and having married ned she came to her senses and matured
asoiaf,removed,i think that the nobility in general are the jocks of the story the ironborn are like the white trash kids that listen to icp get addicted to crackmethheroin and perpetuate the cycle of poverty
asoiaf,removed,lets make croatia northern ireland great again i propose building a wall to keep actors and other unsavoury hbo types out a total ban on actors entering until we figure out what the hell is going on when hbo sends people to croatia and northern ireland theyre not sending people like you and me they play act as murders theyre bringing drugs they play act as rapists and sure some of them i assume the guy who plays davos maybe are nice people
asoiaf,removed,home is where you make it by your logic and username im arguing with a nazi
asoiaf,removed,fuck your throne nigga
asoiaf,removed,thats what you are looking forward to the most a dog
asoiaf,removed,confirmed the donald loves fallout
asoiaf,removed,when gerold iii died without male issues a council crowned his only daughters husband ser joffrey lydden who took the lannister name and became the first andal to rule the rock interestingly the first andal to become king of the rock was a joffrey lannister who wasnt really a lannister the first lannister to become king of the seven kingdoms was a joffrey baratheon who wasnt really a baratheon but was actually joffrey lannister well technically he wouldnt have had the last name lannister being a bastard but still
asoiaf,removed,well the basic illyrio plan was to get dany married to drogo so she and viserys would have an army then they would go to asshai and find the magic needed to hatch a dragon of course things dont go according to plan viserys and drogo have an altercation and viserys dies then things get worse when drogo dies and dany loses her army however things get better when dany hatches her dragons qarth is the first time that illyrio has found out that dany has dragons and is in a position to pick her up she can no longer provide any army but at least she has dragons that her and aegon can ride those dragons are a huge advantage for team illyrio even if the worse happens he can always sell them and get another army
asoiaf,removed,at least its giving us more and more reasons to doubt the script leak
asoiaf,removed,good think jorah did that otherwise dany wouldnt have gained the unsullied freedmen stormcrows and second sons
asoiaf,removed,i say show because in the books she is still alive and there may yet be further content going into her greyscale and it may have an effect on the story going forward however in the show she is dead and there appears to be no visible implication yet and i doubt there will be so why include all those scenes about her greyscale if there wasnt some storytelling purpose to it considering the air time is limited im rewatching as we speak and had the thought when watching the scene where dany commands jorah to find a cure i get a feeling this was just a setup for sam to get some insight into greyscale and then meeting jorah and ultimately curing him
asoiaf,removed,robbs wife and unborn baby being murdered in the red wedding just added even more tension and sadness to the whole event

asoiaf,removed,the bit where you compared a historical fantasy set on our doorstep to the fucking yanks do you breathe through your mouth sonny jim
asoiaf,removed,did you reply while you were drunk you mostly make no sense i am not mysgonistic or a bigot oh of course not i bet you have gay minority and female friends who just love you right if a girl has drunk sex you loonies call it rape you claim youre not a misogynist then throw this whopper out there lol first off if both parties are blackout drunk fine ill agree however if one party is blackout drunk and the other is sober and the sober person still has sex with the blackout drunk party then yes it is rape being drunk consent if someone is drunk and they stick their dick in someone who is passed out then its rape period if you cant not rape someone because youre drunk then dont fucking drink period sexism means that you have a opinion on how a sex should act so that means youre a sexist as well when did i claim anyone should act in any way people can act however they want if theyre a big burly guy and they want to wear pink dresses fine if theyre a petite female and they want to lift weights and join the football team fine how does that affect me in any way it their life their body their choice so sexism isnt inheritantly bad misogyny is a real problen in certain parts of the world and certain cultures but not among the western countries and cultures generally those that are sexists misogynists like to make this claim just like racists like to claim racism isnt really a problem its easy for those that arent victims of a thing to claim that thing isnt a real problem one of my favorite books from the bible is the book of esther this explains everything anyone who takes a book written thousands of years ago in a patriarchal society seriously is generally a misogynist in one way or another no wonder

asoiaf,removed,negromancy
asoiaf,removed,oh ny how like original
asoiaf,removed,oberyn im not going to debate with you because i dont really care about his character tywin however is much better in the books in the books he is a devious fox who embraces every aspect of ruling he manipulates people on the council by using his brother kevan to create the illusion of consensus eddard even describes him as being part fox when he sent the mountain to burn the riverlands tyrion learns several lessons from tywin in the books he learns why tywin felt the need to kill elia and her children as well as why tywin kept the red wedding a secret from tyrion by contrast in the show tywin presumably one of the most capable men in westeros lacks the intelligence to recognize arya stark when she is right in front of his face and thanks to common leading man tropes is shown as getting his hands dirty by engaging himself in battle instead of leading the reserve his only diplomatic tool is being overbearing and threatening and he lacks any trace the diplomacy or deviousness that made him so formidable in the books bottom line the show is pure idiocy there are a thousand wrong details in every single episode the only reason to state otherwise is to pander to the morons who have never picked up a book in their lives
asoiaf,removed,youre being downvoted bc behavior like yours as a mod is bullshit and this isnt the first time youve been involved in inappropriate conductabuse of power and youre even taking joy in it
asoiaf,removed,make the wall great again i dont have to build a wall its there i will make it great again it will be even yyyyyuuuge er with all my brothers behind me i will stand up to the corrupt blonde in kings landin jon snow is stabbed taking the black no women they are racist and misogynist ive run kings landing for years when my cheating poon hound husband was running around i ran the show remember then no wars lots of trade good times so vote for me or my giant zombie will kill you cersei i did a great job across the narrow sea well kinda but now i got tyrion the real brains behind kings landing and ive got three flying flamethrowers who have a taste for human flesh and a horde of mounted rapists who will be on their best behavior vote targareyen only of us have been crazy and im not one of them maybe probably dany vote me because im going to win anyway the kid near the wall brags about his wall im gonna rebuild harrenhall and winterfell im a businessman whose actually done business i have a potential trophy wife a big army and more gold than tywin lannisters asshole vote littlefinger or else littlefinger fuck them stannis
asoiaf,removed,he died
asoiaf,removed,slip ups happen all the time people lose their jobs people get killed etc etc look at hilary clinton as evidence of that
asoiaf,removed,varys speech to aegon in adwd epilogue aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk he has been trained in arms as befits a knight to be but that was not the end of his education he reads and writes he speaks several tongues he has studied history and law and poetry a septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the faith since he was old enough to understand them he has lived with fisherfolk worked with his hands swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need he can fish and cook and bind up a wound he knows what it is like to be hungry to be hunted to be afraid tommen has been taught that kingship is his right aegon knows that kingship is his duty that a king must put his people first and live and rule for them
asoiaf,removed,kind of funny how the future king of westros jon and the future president of the untied states trump are hanging around the same percentage in the polls
asoiaf,removed,i hope there are no idiot fans emailing grrm about this it will annoy him and he will delay his announcement
asoiaf,removed,lol calm down friend might wanna go back to ur kin at tumblr to help u
asoiaf,removed,northern politics are entirely different than southern politics there are different customs different expectations and different ways of accomplishing things they really are a realm apart a separate religion and ethnic group the north has more in common with the ironborn than the other kingdoms
asoiaf,removed,hold the darwin
asoiaf,removed,if ted cruz was an iron islander
asoiaf,removed,your opinion is unpopular because its stupid cat is probably the smartest and most politically astute member of the stark family shes one of the few pov characters to successfully predict major events like theons betrayal and the ironborn invasion if robb had listened to her hed still be alive shes also despite her flaws a fundamentally good person who is primarily interested in protecting her family and honestly all the exaggerated whining about how mean she was to poor widdle jon is fucking dumb people act like she beat him or starved him or something she didnt like him for good reason and said mean things to him occasionally jon can suck it the fuck up he was incredibly lucky and privileged to be raised among his trueborn siblings and lived far better than any of the common people and even most highborn bastards this is the lesson he learns from donal noye at the wall and this what melisandre reminds him of in the show
asoiaf,removed,are you referencing the whole milo thing if so youre an idiot
asoiaf,removed,most likely the wildfire in kings landing will be used once aegon starts to siege the city or after aegon takes the throne and dany invades and accidentally sets it off s i think cersei might use the wildfire to kill the wights at kings landing in the show set leaks have shown that she sees a wight in the dragonpit so she knows they exist in the books i think the others will be stopped at the trident since dany has a dream of burning an army armored in ice there however i think it would be more dramatic if the final battle happened at kings landing in the show and the wildfire is used as a last resort to burn them all
asoiaf,removed,he said this is a fantasy novel not medeival historical or scifi novel which was directly curt and condescending to op not to mention inaccurate based on grrms commentary dont apply your rules selectively
asoiaf,removed,theon always tried to play it gentle with catelyn and was very respectful to win her favours and be considered youre reading too much in it its a very realistic behavior of the smiling fuckboi agot theon whos far different from acok theon when he gets to pyke and realizes hes considered nothing then he just goes full retard lol its not like theon would throw cat a shady smirk before leaving like saying yeah whatever mocking her
asoiaf,removed,its telling and symptomatic how much this subreddit fandom is made of uneducated gamer nerdsgeeks and not of wellread fans by how much you upvote that alex jones youtuber thanks to that terrible mediocre show
asoiaf,removed,that its not all a dream and trump really was elected president of the united states oh im sorry you meant an asoiaf theory didnt you probably tyrion as a secret targ too many secret cooks spoils the secret broth
asoiaf,removed,how can you read those books and be so easily insulted
asoiaf,removed,thanks for the offer of help im at the point right now where ive changed something in the story and now have to untangle my own knot to get back out of it
asoiaf,removed,lmao yeah you sound like a firefly fan you belong as a post on riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,auuuwwkkk literally worse than hitler is what trump is auuuuwwwkkk
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,stop doing that please
asoiaf,removed,imaginings of jon snow as trump
asoiaf,removed,tim kaine figured it out as soon as he saw the cover
asoiaf,removed,if this is your conclusion after reading the books i question your literacy it is incredibly obvious you havent actually read the books if you think kg jaime is nothing special id advise you to cut the facade and actually go read more than the wiki you arent fooling anyone
asoiaf,removed,well of course she means well thats what the good intentions part of it is but are you a good person if you backstab and murder a merchant to free his slaves are you still a good person if you did not give him any sort of ultimatum and had to resort to treachery to get what you wanted are you a good person if you indiscriminately kill innocent masters such as hizdahrs father without so much as a trial are you a good person if you burn down an entire building full of khals are you a good person if you stole gold from the astapor master after he wanted to take it back dany is the perfect candidate for good intentions going to hell she does what she thinks is right and because she does what she thinks is right she believes in what shes doing and she feels justified so when she kills an innocent person she does not regret so much as she feels justified she feels like she did the right thing and thus theres nothing bearing down on her conscience the fact that she murdered someone doesnt bother her because she believes shes morally justified danys good intentions has led her to rationalize the murder of innocents
asoiaf,removed,fuck littlefinger and fuck you
asoiaf,removed,seriously why are you here
asoiaf,removed,sigh youre an idiot there is no wave of illegal immigrants illegal immigration to the united state has pretty leveled out to a net zero in the past decade also your insinuation that people trying to come here illegally are people that the realm needs to be protected from is downright disgusting
asoiaf,removed,arya also sounds like what a nazi would name their daughter
asoiaf,removed,that last sentence reads like a trump tweet
asoiaf,removed,wow so wikifags do exist after all i thought you were a myth
asoiaf,removed,hah for real didnt even recognize her
asoiaf,removed,worst episode to date get the fucking sand out your vagina preston
asoiaf,removed,meanwhile
asoiaf,removed,lol so much butthurt its too funny all those nonsensical theories of his going down the drain
asoiaf,removed,this is typical of all thin wristed liberals dont get too angry about it
asoiaf,removed,hmm this is foreshadowing that indicates that youre very anal about things
asoiaf,removed,took hours to enforce this rule
asoiaf,removed,we stand together sounds too much like stronger together which was the remain sides motto for britain and one of hillary clintons phrases mayhaps a bad omen for hillary
asoiaf,removed,the show does this a lot i think in a show when you have a very limited amount of time to tell a story its easier to see character development when you have a starker contrast in behavior so they make him rougher and less empathetic initially but the payoff is that he really starts to genuinely care for dany and her wants and desires instead of a slow change they like to add more contrast the same thing is happening with jaime by this time in the books he had long started to turn against cersei but in the show they delayed it to give it more impact you saw signs of jaime changing sure but the biggest change of allturning against his own sister and love of his lifewas delayed which will make the payoff that much more immediate and impactful
asoiaf,removed,i agree with ujohninbigd the purpose of these and many other changes from the books to the show is to provide a clearer arc of character development these simplifications do a small disservice to the characters but they serve the structure of the show and make it easier for less dedicated show watchers to understand what is going on another example of these changes is samwell tarlys character in the show vs books by the time he reaches oldtown in the books sam has become quite a bit more serious and developed a firm backbone when he talks to gilly about the baby swapping he has to confront the hardening of jon snow as lord commander and he is himself hardened by it the book version of sam even started a fight with dareon in braavos show sam hasnt had to confront the harsh realities of the world as much and i think stealing his fathers sword will be the plot element that leads to those changes his story has been changed to allow for more dramatic and noticeable growth to occur
asoiaf,removed,i mean the kid has set himself up for disappointment no matter what he seems to have borderline personality disorder honestly i dont get why this is even posted to this sub it feels more like the the insane ramblings of a mental patient
asoiaf,removed,a bunch of religious people died in fire the holocaust is the first thing that springs to my mind
asoiaf,removed,it is not just pretentious but it is mentally deranged the fact that this has upvotes is simply disgusting this is the pure epitome of what is wrong with fandom not just here but across the board this is one of the single most judgmental and offensive things i have seen all week honestly it is boarderline hate speech
asoiaf,removed,no preston jacobs theory are completely whacked out and seriously show signs of mental illness in how obsessed he is with the fiction i mean jesus this video simply disgusts me to say that people who liked this episode are of lower intelligence than him is simply insipid and imo it invalidates everything he says preston is the absolute epitome of what is wrong with not only this fandom but fandom in general i would say that his content should be banned from this sub after this video because in my mind i was just severely insulted in a way that is reflective of hate speech
asoiaf,removed,hmm that seems plausible
asoiaf,removed,i wasnt actually talking about preston with that comment haha i was referring to the people at westerosorg especially linda antonsson
asoiaf,removed,folks can we let people give their ideas on the theme of rape here without being down voted to oblivion please leave the stupid sjw shit for other subs
asoiaf,removed,again read the whole chapter it is explicit that she is in constant pain from the day long ridingmarching drogo isnt the source of her pain becoming dothraki is how can you miss what is literally the theme of the entire chapter
asoiaf,removed,this ones a girl you idiot dressed as a boy
asoiaf,removed,that never happened he said he would let the men and their horses fuck her if it meant him getting his kingdom pretty sure that was never on the table on the other hand her brother actually tried to rape her the night before her wedding
asoiaf,removed,will you also destroy isis
asoiaf,removed,in the books the north was never overrun by ironborn stop being a idiot this seasons plots are full of wholes dont you think even if they did came to wf that theon accepting his bones wouldnt be a scene we would get if they got there before theon even more emotional scene with bran receiving them get your head out of your ass showpleb
asoiaf,removed,thats ridiculous bookreader elitism right there only know stark and lannister after seasons do you think we are borderline mentally retarded
asoiaf,removed,its not the show watchers i remember looking up reviews after each episode and id have to search for them now youtubers desperate for views and pop culture media outlets realize how popular the show is so theyre to ride the wave and boost their ratings by covering game of thrones also to be fair a lot of book readers seemed to enjoy spoiling certain events for show watchers
asoiaf,removed,no comment
asoiaf,removed,i saw a magazine in tesco a few months ago with jon snow is alive plastered across the front page with a picture of kit harington theres no escape
asoiaf,removed,ive got a friend like that if he ever got spoiled hed go apeshit but he constantly spoils stuff not long after the show airs like after the hodor death it couldnt have been more than minutes after it aired and he posted a gif on twitter and facebook of young hodor shouting hold the door
asoiaf,removed,to be fair if its no spoilers the idea that he may not be alive is the spoiler
asoiaf,removed,actually you seem very far from understanding
asoiaf,removed,calm down
asoiaf,removed,maybe you should study more
asoiaf,removed,your sister is damaged
asoiaf,removed,because people are retarded lol
asoiaf,removed,make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,this is cool op thanks for posting ive read about this and the follow up path of the dragon which are her asos chapters did you read this when it first came out or did you pick it up later
asoiaf,removed,contrary to popular belief a found here im the head nigger in charge as said by benson
asoiaf,removed,two other compilations were released danys storm of swords chapters and the greyjoy chapters of feast for crows im honestly surprised the dany acok novella never happened
asoiaf,removed,ah yes another cuck pretending the north wasnt in every single interpretation of the war justified
asoiaf,removed,that should put things in perspective for you my sweet summer child how about dont be condescending my sweet old dickhead
asoiaf,removed,grrm said that people went through with their arranged marriages and that it just never fucking happened that girls abandoned their arranged marriages cause they didnt like the match its pretty funny you would say that because grrm wrote two other women who run away from their arranged marriages alys karstark and shaera targaryen there are also an additional three more nobles who broke their marriage arrangements jaehaerys targaryen jaehaerys ii duncan targaryen and daeron targaryen son of aegon v so apparently it happens in grrms own universe and it does nothing to change the fact that grrm said that in real life if someone mouthed off to the pretty prince a scenario that many think more or less happened if rhaegar found lyanna as the kotlt that the pretty prince wouldve raped her except that is not even remotely true grrm talks about how a low born could not possibly dare to oppose a noble he doesnt say being a spirited person would automatically result in your rape lyanna is a high born lady and the theory isnt that she backtalked to prince and told him to bugger off the theory is that rhaegar caught her which is not something that is an offence against him and that he helped her hide her identity there are no peasants mouthing off princes here there is a prince who finds a lady doing something adventurous but unlady like those two situations arent even remotely close you can dismiss what the author himself said and say it doesnt apply but it really can you simply just dont like what he had to say and prefer your own headcanon version of the story this is exactly what you are doing your entire post is the epitome of projection
asoiaf,removed,thanks obama
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,come on dude youre better than this
asoiaf,removed,come by the bonfire nigga to warm up yo legz
asoiaf,removed,agreed op is practically a parody of a book fan with this post its ridiculous assume none of that will happen in the upcoming books to present it as fact that it wont with no explanation other than pretty much saying i didnt like this stuff so it better not happen is ridiculous i wish people could just appreciate the show and books as separate entities both telling the same story but with variations in the details and some differing subplots we have no idea what will be in the new books but the show definitely gives a good idea of where the plot is going pretending it doesnt is just pure denial
asoiaf,removed,do you need to be spoonfed every plot pointtwist how do you handle asoiaf then if it wasnt made obvious enough in the show theres an official chart confirming rlj
asoiaf,removed,yep especially the battle of the bastards the cavalry vs cavalry scene has to be one of the most brutal depictions of a battle medieval or modern ive ever seen on film
asoiaf,removed,whatever you end up mechanically engineering after you finish college is probably gonna suck if youve never read a book no offensive im just worried is all
asoiaf,removed,due to the ops laziness or oversensitivity to uncommon scenarios this is the kind of bullshit that really pisses people off one of the mods got on my case for calling people who complain about the overuse of spoilers allverything lazy but you and other mods freely call us lazy assuming that we are too lazy to use the correct scope i want to post something and not limit discussion im not lazy i simply dont give a shit about spoilers in fact i am hungry for them your attitudes are condescending and rude you arent going to be able to fix the problems in this sub if you keep up the attitude toward the people who do the heavy lifting and actually make the content thats drawn the huge audience
asoiaf,removed,i dont think hes done yet however your thread title sucks and this comment is indicative of nothing
asoiaf,removed,you just answered your own question everyone used everything even when it wasnt necessary thats a big fancy and completely wrong opinion you have there
asoiaf,removed,this is why the mods have a bad rep way to be condescending
asoiaf,removed,downvoted for being a twat
asoiaf,removed,seriously fucking we know its not out yet and theres no date for it at this time tell us something we dont already know you tests
asoiaf,removed,sorry gotta downvote you and uscrapmasterflex it is called the konami code as it was used in more games than just contra and the code is upupdowndownleftrightleftrightbaselectstart yall were probably not alive when contra was popular innocent summer children
asoiaf,removed,not a fan of this possibility you see a lot of old guys a lot of fat guys but not a lot of fat old guys
asoiaf,removed,shes still alive i thought shed died
asoiaf,removed,if you plan on getting it for summerhill dont youre not gonna get an explanation i am excited to hear we will get one in the future fyi you can find awoiaf online for free if youre not opposed to that sort of thing
asoiaf,removed,karma whore we get it youre an actor on the hit show game of thrones
asoiaf,removed,she is so annoying
asoiaf,removed,yeah but shes a hot dweeby awkward gooberso shes got that over me
asoiaf,removed,she thinks shes so cool because shes on the show game of thrones stfu maisie
asoiaf,removed,did anybody else think truede or whatever will spoil a bunch again
asoiaf,removed,maisie is so unnecessary
asoiaf,removed,im so fucking tired of you blobs of fat and flesh and everything you post here maisie williams threads she looks like fucking sid from ice age her eyes are so far apart the spanish armada could fit there
asoiaf,removed,gay
asoiaf,removed,lol spoiler tag for this this is nothing just maisie hypeing yes we know shit is about to get real as winter is here yes we know whitewalkers will fuck shit up unsubbed from this shitty sub going to rpureasoiaf
asoiaf,removed,ew
asoiaf,removed,i wish people would keep got stuff to rgot not because got stuff is not welcomed here but because that sub could do with something other than just cosplay stuff take the show posts there people make rgot great again
asoiaf,removed,yes yes we heard you already
asoiaf,removed,i would say i really liked it but there were somethings i just really could not get over jons ressurection supposed to have much more impact on the story we didnt even get to see him revealing it to sansa i called that bs the daenerys storyline was the worst yet she did exactly what shes been doing for seasons kings landing was boring until the last few episodes but the rest was pretty good with some really memorable scenes
asoiaf,removed,actually its not fat that makes up my blob but many small bladders
asoiaf,removed,from the people ive spoken to and from what ive read online it wasnt great because a lot of the characters are gone from kl or altogether from the show that were in kl the moves that cersei is making along with the faith militant are just allowed to happen because the main guys with the real power arent around anymore the faith militant wouldnt have done what they have with king robertned starktywin lannister
asoiaf,removed,an actress has some good things to say about the next season and somebody starts a thread where people can yet again bash the show how surprising
asoiaf,removed,i did but somehow i think the statute of limitations has passed on that being a spoiler
asoiaf,removed,it was snowing in kings landing at the end of the last book
asoiaf,removed,the arya stabbing scene in particular stands out a double stab to the gut with a long knife is a fatal wound probably even today with modern medicine so people were convinced arya had tricked the waif to fake her own death there were even video breakdowns of people in the background dressed similarly to aryasimilar hair and people thought that was the hidden explanation turned out to be just bad bad cinematography made worse by her instant recovery after one night of sleep
asoiaf,removed,is young in any world also using faggot and cuck isnt a good look yeah i looked at your comment history and now your comment is even more disturbing now
asoiaf,removed,basically trump
asoiaf,removed,i was really disappointed with how dnd addapted the relationships between the stark family instead of arya being an outcast who was picked on by sansa and jeyne and always told she wasnt good enough she just sort of became a generic tomboy who everyone except sansa thought was funny can you seriously see cat accepting arya running around and practicing archery i genuinely think they only cut this because they wanted people to like sansa so they cut that aspect of her character and the arya we get is kind of the result of that its the same reason they changed the conversation above like you said and the same reason they didnt have sansa betray ned
asoiaf,removed,what a retarded person you are
asoiaf,removed,you should probably go take a nap its past your bedtime and youre getting cranky
asoiaf,removed,if you like stupid tropes
asoiaf,removed,dont disregard the stupid before trope
asoiaf,removed,you got a problem bro
asoiaf,removed,stannis is going to make westoros great again he will build that wall and the wildlings are going to pay for it
asoiaf,removed,i like that he compares trump to joffrey makes a lot of sense
asoiaf,removed,so trump is dead
asoiaf,removed,i see this debated a lot and i think the really answer is completely obvious and people are just forgetting all of the possibilities so trump is clearly vyseris crazy racist imcestuous and selfaggrandizing fully willing to sell or kill amybody and anything he has to satisfy his ambitions i think hillary is more a sansa once a naïve young girl fr a small town she was twisted and made bitter by the grim world in which she lives and her political allies of all people she will have to marry for political gain rather than love she is becoming cold calculating and dispassionate and her greatest ally is westeros greatest financier incidentally only one of these characteras has a chance of ever sitting the iron throne
asoiaf,removed,wow comparing asoiaf characters to the presidential candidates in one thing we do not need
asoiaf,removed,he acts like theres nothing on hillary im not a trump supporter but hes trying to make this election black and white when its not
asoiaf,removed,well some of those comments made me cringe online trump supporters are insufferable
asoiaf,removed,nice way to sneak some pro hillary propaganda in there op
asoiaf,removed,i had no idea he liked corruption so much
asoiaf,removed,for those with discord that want to chat
asoiaf,removed,celebrities using their position to get political annoys me so much of course hes entitled to voice it more power to him but it seems like hes going out of his way at this point to dotalk about anything except the next book
asoiaf,removed,oh god there are people who still buy this bullshit its not real baj completely shits on not only eddard as a character but martin as a writer cause he foreshadowed the shit outta this theory for multiple books remember the series was gonna be a trilogy so he had to start this early and if you think game of thrones was foreshadowing to brandon and ashara then you lack basic comprehension skills this theory is born out of arrogance cause no way a writer would want to place clues for his fans to see nooooo he wouldnt do that he wants to do random and stupid twists
asoiaf,removed,wight hunting is fucking confirmed and by extension jondany fucking is also confirmed
asoiaf,removed,do you have a link to that leak that i could look at
asoiaf,removed,how would one go about reading this leak
asoiaf,removed,i havent read the leaks and i really dont want to but for some reason i just cant stop myself from clicking on production threads and occasionally visiting wotw just wondering why everyone thinks a wight hunting mission is a terrible idea and how it makes look terrible i agree with some other sentiments that the only way anyone is going to believe a bastard deserter traitor and secessionist without cold hard proof on its own that seems like a good idea to me especially since he wouldnt have any allies or sympathizers at all elsewhere under cersei
asoiaf,removed,yeah but he knew super intimate details about scenes that couldnt possibly be filmed in spain like wall and winter fell stuff the only people who fit the intersection of knowing that much about the plot and willing to give the info up is super slim its the higher ups they would be able to spell better unless they made it poor on purpose as a deliberate mislead
asoiaf,removed,could you link me to the leak
asoiaf,removed,hardhome sounded awful when the leaks came out but turned out to be one of the best episodes it sure did but the concept surrounding hardhome was sound so the doubt about hardhome scenes was about the execution of it not the actual story but the doublerangingwighthunt doesnt make a lot of sense not like hardhome especially considering the show already has a traveltime problem as if they would just take jon the bastardturnedkitns word for it exactly the concept of bringing a wight south to convince everybody is actually a very good one but the proposed sequence of events is jon goes south not everybody believes him about the ww jonco go north to catch a wight they go south again to show off the wight now everybody believes them why wouldnt jon take a wight with him the first time he goes south it takes months to travel from the north to kings landing especially now that its winter are all the other characters just going to waste time while jonco have traveladventures it doesnt seem to make a lot of sense
asoiaf,removed,i think the wight hunt makes sense its the only way to prove to everyone the threat is real
asoiaf,removed,i dont think any of that sounds as dumb as jon having the same name as his brother
asoiaf,removed,what leak are you referring to link
asoiaf,removed,how come we arent talking about what brilliant political commentary this is clintons campaign adds show us trump the same way grrm shows us his characters here he is form your own opinion
asoiaf,removed,if they are indeed all true it wont be bad it will be terrible there is just so many wrong things in it that they cant execute it well from arya executing the sentence sansa gives what happened to the man who gives the sentense should swing the sword to jon having the same name as his halfbrother and somehow being legitimate despite rhaegar already being married to jon refusing to bend the knee to daenerys and after being abandoned by her to die in the wight hunt accepting to without getting any mad about what she did bad fanservice jon and dany giving each other looks the whole season being mostly just jon and dany with very little of all the other plots davos joking with gendry about rowing making a meme into the show dany justifying burning people to jon by comparing how he executes criminals and kills people in war and he conceding the point
asoiaf,removed,undead fucking dragon so three heads has the dragon means nothing now theyre going to break a thematic link set up in the second freaking book just to give a showonly character and undead mount that is so fucking stupid i dont even know where to start and how the hell does dany even know somethings gone wrong with the wight hunt much less find the fuel required to turn drogon into a concord jet so she can get there in time to rescue everyone but jon before she hands the nk his new mount on a platter god im normally as big a show supporter as youll find and even i cant defend this this is awful
asoiaf,removed,what leak are you talking about
asoiaf,removed,is there a link to it
asoiaf,removed,i dont give a shit about clinton or trump but i gotta say i like that poster thats a solid poster
asoiaf,removed,that actress probably thinks ice and fire is a condom so thats irrelevant
asoiaf,removed,muh never bein written lel
asoiaf,removed,have you read the leaks apart from a couple of things this season is terrible even worse than season
asoiaf,removed,not just leaked pictures but leaked information this information came out before the picturesand were correct
asoiaf,removed,grrm plz
asoiaf,removed,i dont recall reading twelve companions only companions that they all die the last heros dog dies even his horse his sword snaps made me think of brans story to get to br
asoiaf,removed,iirc jon gave the decree to some northmen including a mormont they werent at the red wedding and havent been seen since its popularly believed that they might appear in the prologue of twow with the blackfish trying to resue jeyne westerling im sure someone can fill in the rest much better than i can
asoiaf,removed,this was confirmed in the twoiaf was this it app
asoiaf,removed,oh you poor bastar ehh i mean sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,in before oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,in rogue one the plans are physically brought to the ship
asoiaf,removed,the bolton foot soldiers are not in phanlax formation as a huge history buff know the difference between a shield wall and a phanlax a phanlax stacks long spears
asoiaf,removed,it was nothing to do with semantics you just threw dumb shit in to the conversation because you have nothing else to fall back on
asoiaf,removed,please george
asoiaf,removed,from the trailers jon has drawn the boltons out of winterfell perfect time for a few crannogmen to sneak through the back entrance
asoiaf,removed,whats even the point of this thread can the mods delete it
asoiaf,removed,people are so retarded for thinking that tyrion did anything wrong and that hell be punished its even more retarded than the wild arya theories
asoiaf,removed,just stop grasping for straws its not fun its not interesting it just plain weird that people come up with theories like this
asoiaf,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo

asoiaf,removed,i dont know if imdb synopsis is true but it sure that dany will appear in episode because in the journey to spain video at about seconds you see tyrionmissandei and a dragon head prop then a few seconds later a guy is holding a clapboard with and the guy who correctly leaked all season plot confirmed that episode will have location winterfell and mereen
asoiaf,removed,not really a theory but i predict that one of the dragons will die in the battle of fire on the show everything has been going danys way for awhile now and they really dont use any dragon except drogon less cgi money too
asoiaf,removed,any theories regarding whether or not bran is brandon the builder he can experience past lives so is he really all the starks that came before
asoiaf,removed,it will be like minute about winterfell and minute about mereen you will see
asoiaf,removed,the book is about feudalism and warpeace the whole of the riverrun sequence was about this or do you just choose to have temporary amnesia in order to shit post incessantly
asoiaf,removed,but the ones he doesnt subvert are just his genius people will make excuses for anything if they fanboy hard enough
asoiaf,removed,this is fucking retarded
asoiaf,removed,thats so stupid
asoiaf,removed,being this delusional rasoiaf hes speaking of brienne
asoiaf,removed,since this episode is supposedly only going to cover winterfell and mereen ill start with winterfell jon offers single combat terns ramsey refuses and sets his own army on jon before jon can get back to his side jon makes it out and ramsey calls his men back before sending rickon out to be shot down by arrows battle will start and wun wun will rock i think tormund jon and davos make it out torumnd because i love him and would really hate for him to die mel will be to traumatized from the stannis battle that ended so poorly that she will say she has nothing left to help jon prebattle sansa will watch as jons forces are decimated and are surrounded i do think vale army will swoop in to save the day though many people hate this i think its the only main thing that could happen in the ranks we may see that wonderful speech we have heard of when the tides turn causing ramsey to retreat back to winterfell to lick his wounds after the battle jon will go in with sansa and lf to talk to ramsey for his terms of surrender ramsey will try to spring a trap but wun wun will wun smash before getting offed but this will cause a free for all and im really hoping for ghost to rip ramseys throat out as sansa watches smiling mereen will have dragons flying over it as dany commands her forces to take the city back she will be angry with tyrion but he will tell her about his plan that would have been good if it had worked mereen will be won again for dany but she is done with it and will leave it in the hands of people who should run it she is going west to take what is hers with fire and blood tyrion will make some remark about going back and how hes the most wanted man in westeros by his sister and im sure daario will top that with something else so thats my thoughts im just ready for sunday
asoiaf,removed,rickon will die one way or another no doubts about it now that jon is at winterfell there is no reason for ramsay to let rickon live anymore look at it if rickon lives if ramsay wins rickon will always be a threat to winterfell and to his claim in the north not only that but as rickon grows up as a prisoner he might grow to be ramsays downfall rickon is marked for death no matter what and what better way to dispose of rickon then to do it infront of his family and to lower their armies morale
asoiaf,removed,i think jamie is gonna kill cercei maybe he kills tommen to save her and then she breaks down hell think of it as a mercy killing
asoiaf,removed,not sure on the source but we were told minutes north minutes mereen
asoiaf,removed,the knights of the vale are definitely going to come in and save the day when all looks lost for jonno and co though on the other hand rickon will die to balance things out
asoiaf,removed,why was jaqen hghar in westros in the first place
asoiaf,removed,tommen will die also and cersei will blow up the sept of baelor with wildfire a northern house will betray ramsey ramsey may call on other houses to help him fight jon the manderlys glovers or cerwins that may use the alliance as a ruse to get back at house bolton in the books the manderlys the richest house in the north pretend to be allied to the boltons while plotting a betrayal if they make an appearance in the bastard bowl expect a change of sides littlefinger will save the day unfortunately the most likely last minute savior of the outnumbered stark army will be petyr baelish
asoiaf,removed,prediction littlefinger will save the day wun dies after an ungodly amount of carnage weve all come to know and love the big friendly giant wun wun but although hes undoubtedly the greatest asset to team stark hes also the biggest target dont get me wrong wun wun will kill an obscene amount of people carving a path of destruction through the bolton army but its an only a matter of time before he takes an arrow to a vital organ at the end of the day hes made of same soft fleshy stuff as the rest of us rickon will die a northern house will betray ramsey davos finds shireens funeral pyre a deadly confrontation between davos and melisandre has been in the making since their introduction on their way to the battle davos may find the spot where melisandre and stannis burned shireen alive davos already is suspicious based on previous conversations between him and melisandre
asoiaf,removed,removing my comment from a post you removed dear me
asoiaf,removed,oh boy here we go all of the following is from your own god damned article if the stab wound punctures the aorta minutes punctures the large bowel probably days doesnt get into the peritoneal cavity unless it gets infected youre probably ok consider a stab wound in upper abdomen which has pierced through upperventral wall of stomach this is what medically called as gastric perforation and requires emergency surgical management within to hours of injury if left unattended the person will develope distension of abdomen with vomitting within to hrs fever within hrs all because of infection spreading to rest of abdomen medically called peritonitis if no surgery is undertaken the person will die due to sepsis within to hrs for those that dont get treated immediately then the problems of gastric leakage causing peritonitis with infection then would be the cause of demise if the knife pierced an organ such as the stomach liver intestines it would definitely be lethal add to this scenario the fact that you are asking for modern survival rates not those of a medieval society on to it the fact that you clearly have no medical knowledge i would just stop it i were you

asoiaf,removed,rob stark named catelyn stark as the heir to his kingdom of the north and riverlands not jon snow varys uses blood magic removing the tongues of children lets them communicate with him at a distance the hound is azor ahai and he will kill robert strong with a bow and fire arrow possibly with arrowheads made by gendry from one of the swords made from ice ser mandon moore was a faceless man paid by littlefinger littlefinger ordered him to kill tyrion
asoiaf,removed,could you link me to the forsaken chapter i seem to be having a hard time finding it
asoiaf,removed,i want to make a little prediction concerning arya in the books shes undergoing training without much hurdle so i reckon her arc would be different from the show in the mercy chapter of twow shes been hanging out with the theater troops and plays the part of sansa in their latest play she hadnt been given any assassination task just something to polish acting skills hence its quite possible she wont be leaving thobaw also stannis is alive and has borrowed heavily from the iron bank which is known to meddle in the affairs of other kingdoms so as to keep their investment safe iron bank can hire faceless men to get rid of stannis opponent which would be ramsay i reckon arya is sent to westeros by the kindly man to assassinate ramsay
asoiaf,removed,nope it just got feet higher and braavos will pay for it
asoiaf,removed,you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,years sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,did you really feel this was post worthy
asoiaf,removed,ok mate
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,this horse manure of a reply has points this sub is pretty atrocious the guy lives modestly for someone worth im sure hes holding the ending hostage that must be it
asoiaf,removed,you think the last book is going to be finished sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,and sansa is totally going to marry ramsay in the books too are you even paying attention of course they make up their own major plot points
asoiaf,removed,im reading this while i poop
asoiaf,removed,the last book wont be done by martin
asoiaf,removed,hes not a terrible person in the books youre probably all butt hurt that hes in love with dany who cares they dont live in modern day earth they live in medieval westeros things kinda happen differently there if you dont understand that youre reading the wrong books
asoiaf,removed,his first book became three books his offscreen timeskip became two books in a bit martin must be a very special guy if he only now realises that hes not a concise writer
asoiaf,removed,it will be finished i wouldnt put money on that
asoiaf,removed,im sorry if this is a bit rude but who the heck are you to say taking years to write a book is lousy when was the last time you wrote a series as good as game of thrones
asoiaf,removed,sounds dumb enough not to be
asoiaf,removed,you keep replying but youre not saying anything other than i dont like waiting we get it
asoiaf,removed,all i picture is grrm at his desk working on a box of twinkies
asoiaf,removed,i dont think it is a picture of a septa it is the shadow of the grim reaper seriously that motherfucker aint getting any younger
asoiaf,removed,i would be less anxious if he wasnt as old and noticeably at risk for health complications as an obese man doubly so that i remember reading there are no plans in place if he keeled over tomorrow theres no secret document with the major characters fates and a general outline waiting for a chosen writer to take over im okay with waiting but im not sure a contingency plan is in place
asoiaf,removed,i just dont want him to die
asoiaf,removed,when did you realize you were never going to see the end of this series
asoiaf,removed,to be honest ive given up hope well ever see twow ive concluded hell die before he finishes either of the last two books if im wrong ill be pleasantly surprised
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,im not sure that fat fuck has ever worked a hard day in his entire life
asoiaf,removed,i am also everyone knows that well never see the last book written by him whether you admit it to yourself or not
asoiaf,removed,i really really truely desperately hope he will live to write the last one because at this rate and his health
asoiaf,removed,he gon be ded before im just preparing myself its not even debate
asoiaf,removed,i guess most of us are just gonna ignore and look the other way regarding health concerns too i wonder what the vegas odds of him ever getting to book seven and completing it before passing
asoiaf,removed,the meaning is extremely clear
asoiaf,removed,nah sounds more like youre being over sensitive
asoiaf,removed,i dont mean to seem cynical but i assume that he wont live to finish the series i hope he has all of his notes organized and has an idea for a successor
asoiaf,removed,stannis fanboys have once again proven that theyre the most delusional ones in this subreddit youre the one that needs a reread
asoiaf,removed,your entitled to your wrong dickeating opinion
asoiaf,removed,ok guy you can explain to cersei that she isnt queen because feudalism doesnt work like that then after laughing in your face she will have the mountain gush your face
asoiaf,removed,ah yes the brilliant story line that requires casual watchers to known the inner workings of feudalism and succession laws she murdered her way to the top now nobody is fucking with her and being honest i dont even know where the fuck you are trying to go with this
asoiaf,removed,dont bring that but what about the menz shit to this sub
asoiaf,removed,not really he sold out to hillary already
asoiaf,removed,vote alliser thorne for lord commander and lets make the nights watch great again
asoiaf,removed,he takes pride in simple things he taught his sons well and he backed the most honorable guy with the best legal claim to the throne unfortunately this is westeros so his sons died screaming his king was fooled by a glamour charm and his favorite baratheon was roasted alive
asoiaf,removed,do you have a link to that chapter ty in advance
asoiaf,removed,westeros is such a shit hole their bitterness about the show is just amusing at this point
asoiaf,removed,rasoiafcirclejerk
asoiaf,removed,ikrand it seems like critics forgot that dorne existsno doubt duplos rigged the emmy
asoiaf,removed,me so smart me so edgy
asoiaf,removed,yes
asoiaf,removed,only if he wore it to his uncles wedding
asoiaf,removed,here come the breaking bad fanboys
asoiaf,removed,quality shitpost
asoiaf,removed,no he hated wearing the crown i cant imagine hed even entertain the idea of an iron man suit
asoiaf,removed,thanks for that incisive analysis
asoiaf,removed,linda is that you
asoiaf,removed,the funny thing is the people who decide the emmys are typically as edgy as you p of course theres some favoritism with big names etc
asoiaf,removed,sorry about that i hadnt realized that he had asked that it not be recorded id just found a link to it in one of the subverses on voat
asoiaf,removed,i agree youd have no success arguing with me honorable of you to admit it
asoiaf,removed,haha
asoiaf,removed,heres my problem at least showwise why would the others launch an assault on the wildlings before jon could evacuate them all over water to the south why not just let them leave
asoiaf,removed,talking facts to a preston apologist is useless
asoiaf,removed,or euron or any of the ironborn or dothraki understanding their culture doesnt mean it negates their acts these are rather deplorable people
asoiaf,removed,when he says he got a lot wrong i dont think hes saying that he messed up any of his crucial points but that there might be quite a few of his smaller details that he misinterpreted i think this series basically says i think doran has this plan for rhoynish restoration these are all the potential motivations i see and these are all the ways i see him acting it out when he says a lot of it could be wrong hes suggesting that some of the claimed motivations arent actually important to doran and some of what hes interpreting as calculated moves are actually just coincidences potentially a lot of them
asoiaf,removed,it actually helps you understand some things in the main storyas this is a no spoilers post ill be vague but there are things that happen in the novellas that then things happen in the main seriesits hard to explain without spoilers and wthout knowing where u are in the main series im not going to take the chance even with spoiler codebut just trust me its worth the read and once u finish i think youll understand what i meanalso pm me if you dont mind and ill explain it to youanyone who wants to know what im talking about
asoiaf,removed,lighter and more fun fantasy story prince gets his head smashed in by his brothers mace seems legit
asoiaf,removed,stannis is the one true king dany fags get outnothomophobic let the usurpers and traitors bend the knee and fuck dd
asoiaf,removed,jon is rightful king and heir to nothing until dany comes strolling in with her dagrons and her army of unsullied and her horde of dothraki screamers and her storm crows and her second sons and the support of the dornish and highgarden and she claims the throne and then all john has to do is be all like hi and then she has to give the throne to him cause he has a wiener its the law
asoiaf,removed,this high school level of arguing is getting nowhere i dont give a fuck about slaves masters or anything in between stop saying i sympathize with anyone thats not my point but youre right its a small minority asking to be slaves again the other adwd dany v are being killed by the pale mare rampaging through the camps of slaves that dany barred entrance to even though it already spread into meereen and even to the invading army such a wise and just decision by your benevolent dany
asoiaf,removed,you keep focusing on those exceptions though you have to be trolling at this point ive never read a more ironic statement you still refuse to put forth anything contrary to my point while simultaneously attempting to pigeon hole me into some goofy ideal that i sympathize with slave owners this is absurd and i would ask that you stop replying i cant help but draw a parallel to the hillary clinton hearings forgive the absolutely uncalled for tangent but here i am putting forth that the supposed leader is using bad judgment and lacks a true sense of justice and youre like black lives matter i cant stop laughing
asoiaf,removed,happy shitposting
asoiaf,removed,this is your brain on tinfoil any questions
asoiaf,removed,i cant wait until the ice dragon comes out of the wall when the horn is blown you stupid asses are gonna feel like really dumb lol
asoiaf,removed,people arent going to search your twitter to find what you said if youre not going to copy others then why bring it up
asoiaf,removed,hes years old he could easily be around another years but hes not exactly the picture of health
asoiaf,removed,yeah who are you though and why would anyone care its off season were here to discuss not circle jerk around you
asoiaf,removed,i dont mean to be rude but how often do you see a very obese year old fat people dont grow very old
asoiaf,removed,oh my sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,being around isnt the same as being able to write his health is in a bad state and he still has to finish books and the dunk egg series
asoiaf,removed,you people need to learn english and re read the books before coming on here and discussing
asoiaf,removed,there are a lot of old people there are a lot of fat people there are not a lot of fat old people
asoiaf,removed,i always tell my patients you can be a fat guy you can be an old guy its very rare to be a fat old guy choose
asoiaf,removed,youre right you have to work for it nothing is obvious but when you find it you realize it was there all along how can you relate your bat shit theory to the existence of the others they are confirmed multiple times please show me one other theory that turned out to be true that had not hints in the text you wont because grrm hints at his curveballs youre entire theory is based on this is what the books tell us but theyre just flat out lying and here is the actual truth
asoiaf,removed,oh thats weird if you check this reddit the writing on the show is terrible and david and dan dont know what they are doing if you check the emmys it only gets nominated for best writing directing and acting every year cry more reddit cry more
asoiaf,removed,no hes totally objective what are you talking about you show apologist
asoiaf,removed,dude shut the fuck up
asoiaf,removed,people praise the show here in this aub while true fans know that we will probably never get a fully realized version of asoiaf its just too sad i dont understand why people in this sub are so happy the show has many enjoyable aspects like the cinematography and the music but knowing how theyve disfigured a truly deep and mysterious story makes it somewhat disappointing most people on this sub have no idea how dd have mutilated asoiaf during the past few seasons by replacing and removing story lines from an epic tale that only makes sense if all story lines are present even martin himself has quietly distanced himself from it at this point
asoiaf,removed,wouldnt there be two big battles one at sea the eurontheonyarakills a sandsnakeand then the casting for more unsullied dothraki extras in spain for a land battle daenerys isnt just going to walk into kings landing
asoiaf,removed,unlike you i dont care what race or gender they are again when did i say i give a crap what race or gender my friends are projecting much rather than trying to put words in my mouth why dont you stick to things ive actually said see above how i quote you that usually helps to avoid making shit up all the gay people that i have met and interatected with were insufferable pricks the likelihood that youve met more than a gay person or two is slim and if you did most likely you were an incredible douche which seeing how youve acted here isnt that much of a stretch to believe who claimed that they want tolerance but gave none to christians and jews or said they were devout christians and gay im perfectly fine with christians and jews believing what they want to believe the issue most fundamentalists have is that they seem to think being equal means that they get to dictate the laws for everyone else and continue to have their beliefs placed on a pedestal by the government but thats not how equality works but if both parties are equally drunk then the sjws and femmists still call it rape no thats not how it works and i seriously doubt you can find one actual case that has turned out that way take brock turner for instance he raped an unconscious woman behind a dumpster took pictures of her body to send to his friends had to be chased off by two actual men and still only got a slap on the wrist he was only given a month jail sentence and was released after serving only so please try and fucking tell me again that the law favors women in rape cases because thats plain bullshit legally women have the upper hand in it because a jury andor a judge will be more sympathetic to a woman than a man again im not sure what world youre living in but thats not how the real world works for divorce cases its almost always the spouse that makes less money that is favored in divorce settlements sure women typically receive more favor in custody suits but guess whos fault that is oh thats right the patriarchal society built by men that implies women are the only ones capable of raising children i played football in high school so that girl better be the fastest woman to ever walk if she wants to survive and get crushed by a linebacker god you keep saying youre not a misogynist then you proceed to provide ample evidence that proves you are do you not realize what a cheauvanist you are have you taken a loo at what they do to women in the middle east or in asia are we in the middle east or asia do you really want to be like those countries now compare that to the west where women can run for high office vote drive marry who they or not all and virtually anyone else so because we dont beat our women for having a life in this country theyre supposed to just be happy they can run for office again were not in the fucking middle east or asia get passed that were talking about our country where we can make a difference bringing up other countries where theres literally nothing we can do to make changes is a red herring nothing more see you arent extending the tolerance you demand for just because someone disagrees with you again where are you getting that i dont know if you realize this but we dont have to tolerate bigotry and sexism wanting to place others as second class citizens isnt just someone simply disagreeing a disagreement would be me liking blue while you like yellow wanting minorities to have less rights is not a simple disagreement at that point your opinion is affecting my right to live freely in this country so believing a womans strength comes from her mind and her soul is a bad thing where the fuck are you getting that you seriously need to take some reading comprehension classes guy because youre making shit up left and right also thanks to patriarchal soecities women are more likely to survive times of distress huh please explain how you think that nonsense works why do they do that because women and children are more valuable to the society than an individual man life cant proceed without both barring scientific advancement of course so neither are more important than the other in a biological sense so you are saying that all the books written in past are all patriarchal lies um no please show me where i said that youre making shit up again try focusing on things ive actually said instead of making shit up in your imagination what i said was that the bible is a book full of patriarchal lies it doesnt line up with science history or archeology so yeah the bible is full of patriarchal lies i said it twice there so that hopefully you read it instead of just making stuff up i never once said anything about all of the books written in the past now that is insane whats insane is that you cant seem to read something without making your own additions then pretending like the person youre debating said those things again stick to what is actually said youll look like less of an idiot that way

asoiaf,removed,because nerd ragers get upset when something doesnt live up to their expectations and a lot of them want a perfect adaptation of the book
asoiaf,removed,and i think most show haters like the first maybe now theyve stopped hating them so vitriolically but when was airing a lot of book purists hated all the changes that were starting to occur a lot of people were claiming that the show was turning to crap despite the consensus among shownly viewers that was teh best season yet a lot of book purists judge the series based on how accurately follows the books that is their prerogative but i think its a bad way to judge a show the show has to stand on its own this is especially true when you consider practical limitations of a tv adaptation you cant do a to adaptation and if you tired it would suck a lot of book purists say the show objectively sucks even if you dont consider the books but i think that is just their bias shining through shows with bad writing dont win best writing awards at the emmys i dont think the show is the best written thing on tv but its well above average another thing i see is that a lot of the people in teh fandom who really dont like the show tend to over emphasis some of the weakpoints of the show every tv show and book or movie has some side plots that sorta suck and some clunky dialog sand snakes sucked ass but they each have about minutes of screen time in the entire series most of it overlapping the entire dorne plot is like minutes or less with a lot of that time being jamie and bronn buddy cop stuff that was actually good the waif was in minutes of the show so even though the sand snakes sucked they didnt ruin and even though the waif sucked it didnt ruin every show has stupid plots you can judge a show by its worst parts
asoiaf,removed,i actually think i might stop watching the show until the books have all been published i told myself i wasnt gonna watch season but i caved because im weak when the show was first announced i decided to read the books first because i always enjoy the original more plus i love epic fantasy as incredible as the show is the books will always hold that special place in my heart i imagine that some people who watched all of the show and then started reading the books probably feel the same way about the show with season we saw the biggest deviation from the written material almost to the point where it was unrecognizable compared to its source material it hit some major setpiece scenes fighting pit jons death walk of shame tyrion making it to meereen etc but it also deviated heavily in other storylines with season we obviously dont know if what were seeing will actually happen in the books but if you look at just the published materials alone you know its going to be significantly different so i dont really know if i want to keep watching a show thats going to tell the gist of the story that i love with a few setpiece scenes peppered in i think id rather wait and read them the way i experienced the story the first time but im weak so who the hell knows

asoiaf,removed,the last lady greyjoy appears in affc she got completely sick after almost all her sons died in the greyjoys rebellion she calls for theon until today httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpalannysharlaw and the last lady tully was a whent and catelyn spoke about her mother sometimes
asoiaf,removed,visenya didnt have any descendants her only son maegor i died without issue house targaryen is entirely descended from aenys i the son of rhaenys and aegon i you should google basic questions like this before shitposting
asoiaf,removed,wylla i believe ned said so himself nothing else to it right
asoiaf,removed,lol do you get a sense of personal satisfaction out of being a reddit hall monitor spoiler alert everything you do is irrelevant
asoiaf,removed,doesnt asha think on her mother a few times saying she just wants to see theon one more time before she dies and that she is kinda crazy with grief also as others have pointed out catelyn thinks about her mother a couple times as well
asoiaf,removed,but if ned is jons father then that meansoh godnobody say it
asoiaf,removed,well there are three reasons for this imo the first is that ned doesnt live long enough to actually mention it the second is that she apparently died awhile ago before robert became king none of the other characters have met her the third is that she doesnt play any role in the story she died before the preliminary events of roberts rebellion
asoiaf,removed,her lineage does iirc she was the daughter of a flint which is one reason why the flints are so ready to jump to stanniss aid in the battle for winterfell
asoiaf,removed,correct me if im wrong but we actually see lady greyjoy when asha is in harlaw
asoiaf,removed,also that neds clearly a secret targ right
asoiaf,removed,if grrm dies before finishing those books well rape his fucking corpse

asoiaf,removed,oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,wow thank you so much this is exactly the sort of criticism i was looking for you have no idea how much this answer means to me your comment should be stickied at the top of this thread and the other more popular sub although i doubt they would care for the wonderful intricacies of the story i dont know exactly how it got in my head maybe someone told me or maybe i read it somewhere but somehow i thought that roberts claim was from orys now that i know its from rhaelle it makes this whole thing much simpler so many people kept saying over and over again that none of this matters and again perhaps thematically it doesnt since like i said asoiaf is partially a criticism on feudalism but it all still matters to the narrative since these legalities affect every noble house in westeros i just couldnt believe that lineage wouldnt matter within the realm time and time again this story reminds us that there are serious consequences to breaking oaths especially oaths of fealty after all historically the entire point of feudalism was the establish a legallybinding pyramid scheme precisely so the most powerful people couldnt just take a title by force and in the cases when that did happen the new power would have to establish entirely new governments and essentially a brand new country cough cough england cough cough if asoiaf were that simple the tyrells would just be the new rulers of a westeros with an entirely new civic structure since thousands of oaths and legallybinding contracts across westeros would be nullified thanks again for letting me know roberts claim came from rhaelle well back to the drawing board
asoiaf,removed,your texts are unreadable please reread them before sending it looks like dyslexic pile of words
asoiaf,removed,yes have balls is synonymous of being brave but have balls is a feature that only men have you can be brave without having balls
asoiaf,removed,you dont have a clue my dude there are tons of plotlines and major differences that the show left out that change the entire story itll be like reading a brand new series by book
asoiaf,removed,someone decodes it aaaaaaah screamed shireen as stannis burned her your grace said ser justin massey i blew the iron banks money on whores also prince doran is dead killed by three women who call themselves the sand snakes
asoiaf,removed,i just want you to know you wasted your time writing all that shit i didnt read it and i just blocked you
asoiaf,removed,viserys had no knowledge of illyrios afflictions with faegon and varys viserys was like six years old when he left westeros so he couldnt plan a wedding grrm has made comments which confirm danys moter is her mother
asoiaf,removed,haha you still think theres gonna be another book the mountain that writes is gonna rest on his laurels a few more years editing wild cards
asoiaf,removed,and he ran straight didnt zig zag until the arrow killed him
asoiaf,removed,in no way was i condesendin im guessing that last line got you mad or something but thats friendly even said bro barristan is an unreliable naerator for this and you dont get my point dayne genes have traditionally been stronger than targ genes if ashara was her mother shed have inherited the black hair the theory isnt correct arya says private gardens have trees you were times more condescending and rude i was very polite even taking time to help someone and recommending the books
asoiaf,removed,and this is why we had cringy scenes with tyrionmissandeigrey worm they still continue to nominate dinklage every year tyrions arc in this season felt like filler with very few memorable moments besides freeing the dragons and his moments with daenerys in ep headey was great this season im okay with maisie and surprisingly kit who to me improved a lot i still think emilias acting is mediocre and would put natalie dormer in her place or even sophie who despite not being amazing is way better than clarke happy for max von sydow think that jonathan pryce should have been nominated
asoiaf,removed,man a few comments like this and im mystified she was the entire reason jon rallied the north and all of those scenes pushing him toward that her scenes with theon early in the season her confrontation with littlefinger her scenes with brienne her scene before the battle of the bastards with jon her scenes in the last episode with jon and littlefinger she had a fuckton more variety and depth than maisie williams or peter dinklage got largely due to story choices but still
asoiaf,removed,your post made no point go discuss your feelings with your friends
asoiaf,removed,dude i only started clash of kings i dont even understand the foreshadowing people are talking about from the first book cause pretty much the only thing that anyone couldve connected was the promise me part he is thinking this while hes thinking of other things while imprisoned qualifying that it takes a special type of retarded for someone not to go whoa holy shit when they see a baby being handed to ned his sister is saying promise me shes been kidnapped by rhaegar we even learned this in the show who is obviously the father than it immediately cuts to jons face staring at the camera after weve been locked onto this babys face while the accompanying music has just hit its crescendo im all for someone not understanding something because theyre esl and something gets lost in translation but this is quite literally an explicit example of the directors showing not telling its extremely obvious and im only a quarter way into the second book the hint isnt a hint its baby jon now take like seconds to take it all in while the camera pulls back
asoiaf,removed,im honestly baffled at why people are so insistent on this why do you want this to be true so badly why do you ignore scores of book evidence that points to this being demonstrably false im sorry and i say this respectfully sine you used this word first but this post is thousands of times more bogus than anyone using internallogic and bookevidence to find a ruler of westeros nobody is forgetting the idea that conquest trumps lineage as you put it people just know better if you honestly believe conquest trumps lineage than you have been paying little attention to the details of this story and again i want to emphasize that i say all this respectfully youre just wildly incorrect and im honestly baffled as to where all the boorish bravado that you put in your post comes from using aegon the conquerer as an example is absolutely absurd in fact not only is it absurd it proves your counterpoint when aegon conquered westeros he didnt conquer a realm he conquered completely independent kingdoms his conquest lead to him creating an entirely new government and entirely eliminating the previous forms of government the fact is your one example ultimately proves that you cannot simply conquer without establishing an entirely new civic structure from the bottom up i highly recommend you do a some research on not just what feudalism is but how the practice of medieval feudalism worked the entire idea of feudalism came from the notion that rulers needed to prevent a way from rulers simply invading and conquering other lands thats literally the entire point of the government you are positing can work by conquest feudalism is an essentially in incredibly convoluted pyramidscheme of legallybinding key words contracts that ensure that the largest army cant simply take titles that arent theirs again thats entirely the point if what youre positing is correct than the tyrells would simply always be the rulers of westeros and thats that we wouldnt even have a story here again i dont mean for this to sound curt or condescending and if this comes off that way i apologize but your post is so brazen and insultingly passionate that i have no other option than to give you a retort with an equal amount of passion so please you and mods this isnt intending to be condescending i am only trying to match ops passion george rr martin has given his audience every single indication possible in every single sort of way that his work is almost entirely based on medieval england sure some things he takes from other parts of history such as valyria being rome and others but byandlarge this is medieval england hell the war of the five kings is almost a retelling of the war of the roses and if you read the books you would see how deeply he delves into the extensive minutiae of how this civic structure works the combined texts are nearly pages and an astonishingly large part of those pages discusses the civic structure and legal complexities of westeros wouldnt it strike you as a little odd that he would go through that great of lengths if the civic structure of westeros had nothing to do with the plot and the whole story were just a freeforall based on conquest and no im not saying that it thematically matters who the rightful heir is or that lineage is important im saying the exact opposite im saying that it is thematically paramount that these things exist and work horribly you need to keep in mind that grrm has spent years doing nothing but writing these books he has few friends he hates the limelight he has no family he hardly has a social life outside of his new york jets fanclub and he still mulls over a heartbreak from the late this is his only legacy and understandably the highlight of his life for context im a relatively young woman with a reasonable social life and ive worked on a dissertation for years that dissertation is one of the most important aspects of my life in so many ways it defines me and that was merely a year process asoiaf took martin years and hes still working there is no way that hes spent years writing a simple story of conquest that could essentially have been told like a hemingwayesque novella this work again a makes enormous statements about grrms personal views on violence redemption war politics religion mythology authority civic authority in general trauma psychology and essentially civic structure and its odd relationship to the human condition in general and he factually uses medieval england as the backdrop for his work and he factually goes into the minutiae on the nonsensical and sadistic structure of feudalism why on earth would he go through this much if there wasnt an incredibly important theme regarding the failure of this civic structure tucked away within his work again he has done nothing but give us an incredibly detailheavy story we have no reason to believe that these details dont matter and if we were to believe that these details dont matter we would be insulting the basic essence of who he is and what he does the game of thrones is that all these characters have to find unique and often malicious ways to get around this absurd civic structure in order to get the power they want cerseis father essentially paid for the iron throne before robert even sat on it there conquest done why on earth would tywin even bother dealing with robert if this was a land of conquest and as simple as you say it is is this conquest theory of yours is true it would singlehandedly reduce the entirety of of his major themes and motifs in one fell swoop again im not saying feudalism is right but it is a huge part of the story and established in major details and the reason for that being is because its only through this awful though ironclad portrayal of a feudal society that grrm can make all the statements he wants to make about civics and humanity and to go back to what feudalism is ill give you a small example to illustrate how important it is to the internallogic of the world if cersei took the iron and a lord paramount accepted it i a simple lowborn farmer would officially have zero legalobligation to him and in turn my noble lord again feudalism is a pyramid of legal oaths and contracts if it doesnt work at the top it breaks at every other level and you can try to make that case that the iron hand would rule but i dont think you understand how much chaos that would result in there are millions of people in westeros if all of them all of the sudden had no legal system no civic structure there would be hundreds of random alliances amongst hundreds of random noble lords there would be no map any longer there would be no regions it would be a chaotic freeforall there would be nothing left the entire continent would be tossed back to tribes bickering for land i could keep going there are just so many narrative reasons youre wrong as well why would robert care about killing dany and the rest of the baratheons why would bastardy matter why would marriage alliances to the throne matter why would oaths matter jesus i cant believe i havent even brought that up this thing that time and time again has been stuffed down our throats as the most important thing in the land do you know why its so important because its legal but i honestly just am gonna stop here please im asking you as a friend and saying this politely out of love do a little more research on feudalism and medieval feudalism in particular do a little more research on grrm and reread the books its not about as you say who deserves it its about the thematic implicationsramifications of what your positing and how if what youre saying is right we have been doing nothing but readingwatching nothing more than a bloodier sexier and more convoluted version of a les moonves sitcom except with dragons
asoiaf,removed,oh shut up already
asoiaf,removed,grrm plz do you see what this has come to
asoiaf,removed,theyre going to build a wall to prevent illegal irrigation
asoiaf,removed,no women are not constantly aware of how their breasts feel and theyre not always consciously thinking of how they jiggle swing look or bounce around but theyre surely aware a good deal of the time this is terrible feminist nitpicking you should be ashamed
asoiaf,removed,or how about i readwrite spoilers everything posts and you readwrite whatever the hell you want everybody can be happy by minding their own business and not caring if someone else is reading moreless then them
asoiaf,removed,hahahahaha hahahahahahaha hahahahaha hahahaha
asoiaf,removed,if it was nothing but a name change it wouldnt be as big of a deal to the people who actually take the time to write the content that drives this sub but they have effectively taken the top levels away from use by the unwashed nonmod heathens congratulations you and the other spoilerphobes have gotten your way more threads will be safe for youbecause many of us have decided to stop posting this wont change the behavior of posters just who posts there will be a lot less content but at least it will be to your satisfaction
asoiaf,removed,this subreddit has turned to shit why cant shitposts stay on the containment board
asoiaf,removed,are you high did you have a stroke
asoiaf,removed,i prefer people who are wholethors not those loser halfthors donald trump
asoiaf,removed,cersei the carpet muncher
asoiaf,removed,i hope his future chapter names are both cool and fucking terrifying things like dragon rider where wargs a dragon and accidentally gets it killed nights king when he tries warging the nights king causing the door the great other when he starts being influenced by them because he goes too far north and his last chapter being brandon stark or lord of winterfell which is him finally becoming himself grrm can do a lot with this much like he did with theon greydude
asoiaf,removed,i just finished brans last asos chapter in it he remembers old nan telling him stories about the nightfort and at the end she calls him brandon thats actually when i first realized
asoiaf,removed,maybe meera will die maybe meera is brans horse if you know what i mean ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
asoiaf,removed,theyve reported him filming in the riverlands
asoiaf,removed,implying the ironborn arent completely retarded
asoiaf,removed,both deaths are pretty depressing but at least stannis didnt get shireen mentally retarded for more than a half of her life to kill her for his own gains
asoiaf,removed,retarded seems like a fair way to describe this decision and then to follow it up by essentially hiding the option from those planning too die helping your cause is just well im speechless
asoiaf,removed,oh my god hes donald trump
asoiaf,removed,i would say for being retarded hodor lived a fairly good lofe most places he would be abused and tormented
asoiaf,removed,the actor who plays benjen is listed as appearing as black brother beyond wall in the next episode deus ex benjen inbound folks
asoiaf,removed,first off theres a dbad policy second i read every book available long before the goddamn show was on air and book the first week it came out my original point which you still havent gotten was that all the people who think its unrealistic that bran is escaping missed the entire point and youre randomly answered with something about time travel the person i first addressed didnt bring it up i didnt bring it up you did and tried to shoehorn it into the conversation about something else entirely
asoiaf,removed,speaking of the devil wheres lindas meltdown
asoiaf,removed,thats all i need not my fault you apparently dont recognize it
asoiaf,removed,if you really think the show is going to diverge on primary points like the origins of the others the meaning of hodor jons parents brans purpose etc you are kidding yourself
asoiaf,removed,or they could have just adapted it the way it was meant to be
asoiaf,removed,see this is where i get very frustrated with you when you say wyliss body is a conduit through timespace thats an invention on your part we dont have any proof that that has ever happened before then i say well it appeared that wyliss consciousness has merged with hodors in the future and you say you just want it to be like that then i point out well by process of elimination brans consciousness was in the past and it couldnt have split into two you answer well then how did wyliss consciousness get split into two you cant have it both ways meanwhile what im saying is no wylis went to the future and his consciousness somehow merged with himself he experienced himself dying thats what broke his mind the frantic hodor hodor hodor thats what he was saying to himself as he was being ripped apart by wights and you say no bran is controlling him you made that up no i didnt make it up thats what the entire scene was about thats why it was shot that way thats why it was edited that way thats why hodor hears himself screaming at the end stop saying magical shit doesnt work the way you want it to and accusing me of doing that its beyond irritating
asoiaf,removed,so euron trump ick
asoiaf,removed,wait a sec you think they killed grenn and pyp for financial reasons youre an idiot im sorry
asoiaf,removed,if euron is trump then what does that make bran build a wall stark
asoiaf,removed,millions and millions of dollars are being pumped into this show if you think they cant afford to animate a dog you are absolutely retarded
asoiaf,removed,this sub is so supremely disappointing after last nights episode its like yall forgot how to recall established facts and how to analyze content
asoiaf,removed,but yaras speech was like a clinton speech full of empty platitudes euron came in and said ive been here and there and seen some shit and this is what ive learned and this is what im gonna do yara just identified the problems euron had solutions and a plan
asoiaf,removed,oh shut up
asoiaf,removed,rofl ive started seeing this across reddit the most cheesy and retarded justification for a terrible and pointless scene
asoiaf,removed,sure if by easily books only you mean stupid and clearly wont happen
asoiaf,removed,just stop talking dumb cunt
asoiaf,removed,yea thats why we see so much of ghost
asoiaf,removed,oh shut the fuck up thats shit
asoiaf,removed,stop it summer died immediately and didnt slow anything down
asoiaf,removed,go watch the scene again he didnt delay a damn thing
asoiaf,removed,whatever man grasp at those straws
asoiaf,removed,i dont need to its obvious let me know when you wake up
asoiaf,removed,thats what im asking but you just downvote and be a passive aggressive twat about it is there any additional information regarding the nature of cotfs magic nk powers other than bran got marked by the nk and the cotf cave lost the magic are we extrapolating that information and just assuming that now any cotf magic bran comes across is completely useless
asoiaf,removed,hes on the list for the next four episodes
asoiaf,removed,it was fucking terrible writing they gave a visual of people running from the kingsmoot those people stole the fleet i am a diehard fan of the book series but what they try to pass in the show as decent or even acceptable storytelling makes me think all of the show fans are retards
asoiaf,removed,it feels like im in a trump subreddit loll
asoiaf,removed,yea he did trust dd with the spoilersto make a fucking episode about it did you really think this season was going to be completely made up and none of it would be in twow cmon man im sure youre smarter than that
asoiaf,removed,i made a post earlier today pointing this out but the mods didnt let it through oh well im hyped nonetheless
asoiaf,removed,uhh that scene with dany and jorah was damn retarded like it was terrible acting but it was damn retarded as well so her friend is dying of greyscale she is the queen of the dothraki and mereen right nowuhh she doesnt have doctors hell stannis didnt send shireen away and say cure yourself girl i command you no he spent a ton of money and got her every doctor worth a damn and cured her what is this trash i get by storytelling rules he will come back and deus ex machina save her since this shows trash now but that was dumb as hell
asoiaf,removed,prove it
asoiaf,removed,torrents lead to more recognition and through recognition comes revenue more nontorrent viewers purchases of showaffiliated products ie mugs and more publicity theres a reason why hbo cares not about legitimate viewers but about getting more people hooked
asoiaf,removed,this is a spoilers main thread gotta use spoiler tags if you want to talk about that material
asoiaf,removed,a lot of people are cunts
asoiaf,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprosopagnosia
asoiaf,removed,what are you smoking and where can i get some is preston your supplier
asoiaf,removed,doesnt matter if yara lost the kingsmoot shed beat trump in the general by
asoiaf,removed,i suppose those who might not get cable but have hbo and want to watch say the americans on fx
asoiaf,removed,you think this sub is bad go on tv
asoiaf,removed,brain rape a nitwit
asoiaf,removed,language is fluid pal words and phrases aquire different meanings over time you know perfectly well what someone means when they say begs the question in that context there is no problem there trying to correct someone like that just shows that you know a lot less about language than you think you do
asoiaf,removed,pretty ignorant of you to say
asoiaf,removed,to me its odd that years after the first men and the children of the forest made the pactthey were at peace for yearseven shared culture the others attack and begin the long night unless what has been told in the books isnt accurate and the story flawed im having trouble following the shows version
asoiaf,removed,that type of attitude is retarded oh well boromir didnt matter anyways since he dies in the first book like his actions are still being discussed to this day grrm is setting up a legacy that will last decades and the end may seem important now but realize it wont actually make up the majority of the series
asoiaf,removed,this thread was removed for spoilers in the title
asoiaf,removed,asking someone to think about why theyre insulting me isnt being condescending its advising them to think before breaking subreddit rules stop harassing me please

asoiaf,removed,like social media will let you wait for the books i have to disconnect myself from the internet every monday because people are fucking assholes even in youtube there are spoilers in the titles and thumbnail on the front page
asoiaf,removed,seriously some people on here need everything spelled out for them it was to show that shes still arya not a girl without a name
asoiaf,removed,rip qq and bb
asoiaf,removed,hodor only became retarded because of time travel and it had to happen because it was predetermined thats boring i like watching kings landing lose all its power distribution jon snow dealing with the wildlings and nw dany dealing with being a queen i laughed at the kid spazing out the idea that his whole life is just to serve is boring i dont view hodor as a person anymore
asoiaf,removed,why is everyone making a big deal over theon having no heirs he still has plenty of time
asoiaf,removed,a perfect example of the linda and elio type kinda funny that you complain about haters and at the same time make a comment about elio and linda who shouldnt even be part of the topic here i guess you kinda hate on them
asoiaf,removed,you are a classy person arent you complaining about hating and at the same time you hate on elio and linda with absurd statements yourself such a hypocrite
asoiaf,removed,you are such a selfentitled little prick
asoiaf,removed,可以写中文啊。there comes to me a question that where are most of you come from americaeurope
asoiaf,removed,uuseremulatorujenniferlopez
asoiaf,removed,am bipolar can confirm last week had me feeling hype as shit between the stark reunion and dany getting spicy this week had me crying myself to sleep talk about a roller coaster ride
asoiaf,removed,sorry but you are wrong there originally was a past where wylis grew up just fine bran traveled through time to turn him into hodor who knows how many times bran had to do this to get the perfect arrangement to what we now have as our closed loop but it is absolutely necessary that those erased timelines did occur
asoiaf,removed,i was being civil and you i quote said end of discussion youre not interested in discussion youre interested in being right i was presenting perfectly thought out and reasonable arguments with backup and you decided it wasnt what you want so you say end of discussion i again explain my point and you say sorry but you are wrong you are not looking for discussion youre looking for validation sorry im here to discuss and thats what i was doing the fact that you think i was being disrespectful and i was hurting the discussion and not understanding thats what you were doing is amazingly delusional and hypocritical if you want to report me for calling you what you were being then so be it but dont for a second think you actually want discussion
asoiaf,removed,then why is bernie losing
asoiaf,removed,he truly is trump
asoiaf,removed,cant search on my phone app once i get to my computer ill see if i can find the link if youre too lazy
asoiaf,removed,the episode was titled the door after all sorry
asoiaf,removed,cant rape your wife in westeros
asoiaf,removed,hillary bernie or trump
asoiaf,removed,why are you always sucking the cock off islamist muslims
asoiaf,removed,so not totally off topic but i have a friend who is an adamant book fan who has never really followed the show closely and is trying to do the impossible avoid all spoilers until twow i told him hed never be able to do it but he has no interest in the show so hes trying his best after the last episode i asked him if he had anything spoiled he said im not sure what hold the door is but it is apparently big i told him to try not to think about it too hard im not gonna be the guy to spoil it for him but i really want to see the moment where he connects hold the door and hodor we talk a lot we play games together online etc so im going to slowly start to just randomly say hold the door and work it into conversations just to mess with him ill slowly start to slur the words together until he finally gets it itll be priceless
asoiaf,removed,greyjoy also lost their lord granted euron is of the same generation as balon so the show has seen all of the big lords downed north riverlands vale stormlands westerlands dorne iron islands reach the king on the iron thronecrownlands lord commander of the nights watch

asoiaf,removed,um excuse me make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,we really need a new book this sub is getting pretty bad
asoiaf,removed,thus spake some idiot who simply needs to read it for the one hundred and fourteenth time im on my reread of a feast for crows i noticed something i noticed that this book is horrible and the series feels worse with every twist of a page the once vivid vibrant world feels dead the individual character arcs have blended together in a disgusting amalgamation of pain and misery in my mind every morning i wake up to reread a feast for crows and every night i cry myself to sleep i stopped going to work to reread a feast for crows its ok id tell myself there are many species of birds i dont even know what that means i dont understand anything i could no longer pay rent so i moved to a lowcost lowmaintenance derelic apartment downtown nobody here is educated enough to appreciate a feast for crows everyone is constantly drunk or high or both and the crime rate is only getting higher one day i saw a drunk man drinking from a filthy shoe and defecating at the side of the street the more he drank the more he shat i thought and giggled to myself he saw me and stabbed me with a rusty papercutter i think ive got tetanus now but at least ive got a feast for crows i got home bleeding and crying and i opened up my copy of a feast for crows its so disgusting now bloody and filthy and full of disease it sickens me i reached the broken man speech and the nuance of septon meribald eased my pain a bit i didnt have to cry in order to sleep today i dont think i could even if i tried though ive been eating nothing but soy beans and pasta sauce the past months my mother came to visit but all my malnutritioned eyes would allow me to see was a shady silhouette that resembled a fat pink mast she tried to talk to me i couldnt understand words are wind i thought and started laughing i scared her she left in a panic and i dont think ive seen her since i dont remember how long ago that was i lost count of the days time for me now is counted in rereads of a feast for crows david benioff only read this book times he doesnt understand i understand there are many species of birds ive grown sickly and malnurished i left all my friends a long time ago and my family barely visits anymore i can no longer stand up every day i wake up and can barely move i put my copy of a feast for crows on the coffee table next to me so that i can open the book faster every time i wake up ive lost all my will to live i want it all to end i cant move my mouth but i want to scream and cry and tear this awful book to shreds george martin is a hack game of thrones is terrible i hate essos i hate westeros i want to go home i want to die my house has fallen into disrepair every time i wake up i pray to the faceless god to end my suffering i dont remember what gods are worshipped in the real world whoever they are i hope they end my suffering i look at the ceiling and see its musty and about to collapse i pray that it falls on my head and cracks my skull in half i remembered that men have scars women mysteries but i fear that if that happens i might survive and forget all about a feast for crows i love a feast for crows i hate a feast for crows i hope the country gets invaded war seems like a fine adventure after all i hope the war kills me i want it all to end i miss the world i miss my family i even miss emilia clarke and mark mylod i hate this goddamn book i hate myself how did i let it all come to this so how are you guys enjoying your reread of a feast for crows d

asoiaf,removed,cool buddy you gonna do anything about the title
asoiaf,removed,idk affc and adwd are pretty long books you realize dd would need to read the entire thing to be faithful the show gave us arya washing floors missandey and grey worm love story tyennes boobs what more can you want people who want barristan having badass fights and an awesome kingsmoot are entitled book snobs with heads up their asses
asoiaf,removed,one a couple a few many
asoiaf,removed,the role of warden is not the same as a lordship it involves no land no honours its purely a battle command which a knight of the kingsguard would be well enough suited for daven lannister is not a lord of any particular thing and yet acts as warden later on warden and lord paramount of a region are often tied together lord stark whichever stark he is at the time is usually warden of the north because he can muster the biggest forces and use his status as lord of winterfell to pull bannermen into line but they dont have to be a boy lord like robert arryn would not be acting as warden nor would tyrion nor will bran if he inherits since bran cant be a military commander if he cant fight in a case like one of those three a substitute warden would be named jaime for tyrion for instance or one of the royces as a temporary fillin for sweetrobin until sweetrobin grows into a man
asoiaf,removed,the one where his dick wouldnt work i always thought it was just a sign that he had grown up a bit and was no longer affected by whores the way a baby is affected by jingling a set of keys the first time we saw him in the show he was getting his dick sucked in winterfell because he was a trust fund baby with nothing better to do then he saw combat ruled the realm for a bit got arrested for two crimes he didnt commit and almost executed for one killed his dad and sailed across the ocean in a barrel it was his dick saying youre too old for this shit she had a bit of a unibrow if i recall correctly but if anything thats a dead giveaway that she was not a twink a twink would wax that shit
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,dude just fuck off i regret engaging in conversation with you
asoiaf,removed,fuck trump
asoiaf,removed,too bad there isnt a rule about reading comprehension
asoiaf,removed,i havent watched the show since snow came back i felt that the show took too many liberties with a story that i have invested a lot of time in for really no valid reason at this point i can wait ive been waiting for so long and have the wheel of time series to get me by i am not interested in the show anymore
asoiaf,removed,same i mean stuff like dany and the dothraki and jon returning will probably play out in different ways but just by reading this subreddit we knew theyd happen cersei blowing up the sept in the show i honestly cant see happening in the books
asoiaf,removed,the arya stuff in episode is abysmal but the rest of the episode is really great imo so is the broken man i get it that the arya stuff pissed off a lot of people so they just hate the episode in its entirety but i really like it
asoiaf,removed,is this still a thing
asoiaf,removed,she sounds like a a little attention whore god what an awful person i hope the dj plays thy song everytime he sees her until she passes out hits her head on a rock gets amnesia and allows a divorce and she does alone right before she dies alone that is all the memories of how much she loved the groom come back

asoiaf,removed,go live your life kid come back to these books when you turn
asoiaf,removed,never mind kid nice talking to you
asoiaf,removed,my fav characters are tyrion the imp daenerys and the eunuch the scene that got me hooked was probably the whole part where tyrion is put on trial in the veil i like how he talked lysa and ayra into giving him a trial by combat which his champion won in spectacular fashion that last line before he left a lannister always pays his debts as he throws the guy some coin loved it i also like many things of the got universe the mystery of the white walkers and jon snows mother the political intrigue both in kings landing and the seven kingdoms the graphic battles are also a favorite the starkness between the old gods and the new is also interesting however what really interests me the most is the fact that we are more or less jumping in on the middle of the history of westeros stuff happened before the death of the mad king and stuff probably continues on after the last episodes credits roll the show constantly hints at a large and complicated lore that is just as vibrant and rich as the story thats being told now also how the characters are fleshed out is really cool to really helps you get connected to them only to see them die damn you george
asoiaf,removed,attacking the twins would have been ethical of course you think that you you clearly have no understanding of what ethical means you are clearly an idiot if you dont understand why this is unethical
asoiaf,removed,well i just finished season and holy shit already dragons dont know why people were all where are my dragons george get on with it but whatever danaerys also is a total fucking badass leading a slave army presumably against drogos old horde i also see that robb is probably gonna win his war if what tyrion says is true if they are losing then that little bastard geoffry doesnt stand a chance i think the white walkers are gonna utterly wreck the nights watch they just rode out in force against them to find the other stark that went missing i also see ayra stark joining the knights watch to escape kings landing which wasunexpected although i think jon snow will keep her safe i also have taken a liking to sam he is kind of like a sam to jons frodo
asoiaf,removed,it gets better and better each season honestly robs and catelyns season stories are amazing
asoiaf,removed,i did the same thing op did except it was when was just ending i knew i liked the character depth and plot in a general sense but when ned got axed i decided i wouldnt watch another second of the show before finishing all available books the plot is very close to agot so you can imagine that i was a fan long story short i walk around now like ive been reading since complaining about shownlys and discussing the significance of arya tossing coins with her right hand
asoiaf,removed,what do you think about theon greyjoy
asoiaf,removed,so tired of people calling verse srupiddumb thera almost a sexism to it shes outlived everyone and made herself queen her ploy with the septon did work btw his kangaroo court brought everyone together feeling securetill boom
asoiaf,removed,just a small correction jon is in the nights watch as in theyre guarding against what comes during the long night winter
asoiaf,removed,if youve watched season one surely you know the white walkers are more than a myth i mean they are in the first scene of the first episode
asoiaf,removed,stay away atleast until you finish the series there are many spoilers lurkins around some even in the posts titles
asoiaf,removed,wellthat would be bad someone in this sub wrote once that we should sneak into grrms house and look in his computer for twow chapters and take photos i think this is coming lol
asoiaf,removed,lol no sjws are the scum of earth
asoiaf,removed,just what i said for the past couple seasons that butterflies see grrms blog have really cheapened the story the best example is the complete severing of the story in dorne but theyve turned arya into a wolverinenightcrawler hybrid where she is immune to injury and blinks around continents just mho but the show is laughably bad these days what it is still really great at is the technical side direction costumes sometimes we get some good acting all of it is good or sometimes great but the writing kinda sucks its ok to be different from the books but make it better
asoiaf,removed,im waiting for someone to shop trump s face into cersei
asoiaf,removed,i did have some quibbles about some wardrobe choices in season two namely in qarth and the iron islands theres one scene in particular in qarth where nearly every woman is wearing the same dress including dany of the same cloth just in or different colors i just dont think that rich women in an important merchant city would be wearing the same thing as every other woman at the party for the iron islanders they all wore the same bluegrey salt stained cloth often in the same style it just seemed odd a relatively poor people due to the lack of reaving since balons revolt probably wouldnt be able to afford so much blue dye or give enough of a fuck to match one another in other poorer areas they stuck with natural fabric colors and cheaper dyes like browns and not everyone matched in season two they also made pretty much every wilding wear the same thing but that could be explained as a need for camouflage
asoiaf,removed,i would because theres a mystery about who the grand sparrow is at least theres more to the tyrells too id be surprised if it happened exactly like that in the book the reason we know there is wildfire stocked below kings landing is because they found the stuff beneath baelors sept and removed it i guess that was when jamie was serving aerys and i dont see cersei getting more in now with the warriors sons guarding the place but we know about the stock of wildfire for a reason as well so im sure something similar will happen
asoiaf,removed,george pls
asoiaf,removed,i would pay good money to be in the middle of that threesome
asoiaf,removed,benjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjen benjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjenbenjen benjen benjen benjen benjen
asoiaf,removed,stannis fans have their own easily recognized culture its basically be really obnoxious and hyped about everything pretty certain they intersect heavily with the cleganebowl crowd and that is just one more reason i hope it doesnt happen
asoiaf,removed,if the rumors are true bran the builder is most like trump because of the whole wall thing
asoiaf,removed,yeah and dragons and white walkers make perfect sense you half wit
asoiaf,removed,okay straight up youre being fucking retarded he has been in a grand total of two scenes the show cant peer into aerons head to see how mad euron truly is and theres no victarion to boast to if they cant get those points across while mostly forgoing these characters then you can fucking complain but its way too fucking early right now you goddamn whiners
asoiaf,removed,no viserys is like bernie angry a loser and a failure throught his entire life trump would be more euron or the iron bank
asoiaf,removed,euron is potentially molester though and as far as we know trump hasnt done that
asoiaf,removed,sorry
asoiaf,removed,if u like yara thats the last thing you want to see trump pwwnned rubios ass after he brought up the tiny hands thing
asoiaf,removed,found the fatty
asoiaf,removed,that doesnt make the scene any more compelling show dany is just really boring compared to book dany its probably because they are rushing in the show though
asoiaf,removed,jeez u dumb its so obvious that the directors dont feel the need to explicitly show them travelling but i guess they were wrong this isnt hard at all another example from catch me if you can tom hanks finds a letter from leo in leos dads apartment with a californian stamp on it next scene hanks is in cali it didnt cross my mind that he teleported i just figured he traveled by conventional means but it didnt shoe you because it assumes the viewer is smart enough to put two and two together its like saying wow ive never seen littlefinger take a shit in the entire series does littlefinger never shit or does he just hold it in he must have magic bowls continuity error
asoiaf,removed,go ahead and ban me for half wit and ill take it with a smile
asoiaf,removed,thanks its behind a membership wall now though glad you got to see it before reddit took it down
asoiaf,removed,his ass
asoiaf,removed,and about wrights or so but no im not acting like everyone dead is suddenly up on their feet having someone come back from the dead can be impactful once or twice but if it happens too often it simply feels cheap with jon it was so blatant there was literally way his story made sense without a resurrection no suspense whatsoever foreshadowing was faaaaar too heavy you had to be genuinely retarded to think he wasnt coming back
asoiaf,removed,please fill out this quick census for our records are you a foreign b retarded c trolling d under
asoiaf,removed,yeah the wights have so much character development too just gets in the way it definitely detracts to have a zombie army that cant be easily killed cant see how that could be an obstacle if the wights truly bug any of you youve had years to decide that this story sucked for someone posting in a book sub you certainly lack basic reading comprehension blame grrm for that hes the one who had to throw in the last minute red herring i am blaming grrm
asoiaf,removed,well sorry for not being boring and leading people by their noses its an interesting choice to show years as having that effect on ned visually very much on topic but whatever no fun zone noted
asoiaf,removed,whats a thyroid its like a part of your brain that so youre a retard then thank god i thought i was a bad father youre just mentally deficient i love you son okay
asoiaf,removed,you havent proved me wrong at all thats almost the only way to reveal this
asoiaf,removed,its because you have yet to give an answer much beyond it sucks why because i didnt like it and feel that it sucks how so not what i expect the books to do diferent mediums impossible what do you expect the books to do not that well what clearly you dont have the mental capacity to understand my vague and laconic answers and youre downvoting me good day sir i damn sure dont have the ability to read your mind nor does anyone else here which again is why i am asking
asoiaf,removed,lol you have copied and pasted my transcription loads of work btw from thelasthearth forums
asoiaf,removed,here is a which suggests you can stop spamming that joke now
asoiaf,removed,from one fictional ressurection to another
asoiaf,removed,lazy people who expect it to be a simplistic reductive parade of tits dragons
asoiaf,removed,according to reddit the river is called fag tho
asoiaf,removed,i think what hes saying is if almost all of your people shit on someone for being smart those people probably arent too smart themselves
asoiaf,removed,youre right like calling all people who say they have thyroid issues liars
asoiaf,removed,really not this shit again
asoiaf,removed,let me see nonamerican accent some writing skill a popculture dictionary a cunty mouth a drunken infants energy and no serious analytical skills whatsoever fun stuff and now to wait for the adult analysis from alt shift x
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,is saying so at the beginning of sentences the new um
asoiaf,removed,please even his deep analysis is just surface stuff he doesnt ever dig deeply into anything ive seen all his videos i enjoy them all hes a quasiintellectual at best i understand why people dig him and i understand why people downvote me for not sucking on his clit its the modern era of the internet you either fall in line with the irrational masses or you get downvoted bring on the downvotes
asoiaf,removed,wow its like the show has other characters storylines to cover or something wait until the show is at least over before you bitch about what was left out you dont know that these things wont get covered on the way to bastardbowl at bastardbowl or after bastardbowl
asoiaf,removed,there is somebody recorded and typed out the whole thing
asoiaf,removed,naming the acting king to fight against his mother while proving he is not the rightfull heir one of the most retarded theories to came of reddit
asoiaf,removed,i had the same dumb replies shes evil if she goes to westeros because some innocent people will die the result of her invasion im like sweet mother of dragons what about robb and stannis and all that theirs war didnt kill or caused chaos and death for the smallfolk didnt you read aryas chapter s
asoiaf,removed,so sick of thesejust finish the fucking book years between books is ridiculousseriously wish hed just die so i can forget about it
asoiaf,removed,side note one of the many problems hillary clinton is facing in her election campaign is this same problem i dont think so shes a very weak and flawed candidate thats why shes going downhill so fast
asoiaf,removed,dude you myst being this dense on purpose when you say all of danys scenes i commented regarding all of them we know she is surrounded bu dothraki
asoiaf,removed,you said all of danys scenes that does not mean her scene from season all of the others were in the books and she is one of grrms top why on earth would they cut her scenes that is why you are being dense
asoiaf,removed,because you said the westerland vassals were far more loyal to tywin than the northern vassals were to the starks prove it robb was murdered by of his own northern vassals evidence is pretty clear now you mentioned that the starks have a special releationship with their vassals that the other lords of the realm dont your turn to proove it though we both know that you will not attempt to as there is zero evidence in the books to show it its not a bad point its a point that the majority of people seem to agree with lol who are the majority of the people bring them along as maybe they can prove your point for you as you seem to be incapable of doing so like i said basically your entire argument relies on one anomalous event the red wedding and the fact that we dont see much of the other realms houses lol the starks were overthrown by their own vassals their vassals ended their rule over the north what further evidence do we need and once again where is your evidence that the northern vassals respected their lords any more than the vassals of the vale dorne westerlands reach etc you dont have any none at all this the need to create strawman after strawman and notice how you didnt even respond to what i said i have responded to everything you have said and will continue to do as this shit is cracking me up some of the quotes dont show what you claim they do yeah they do its cute that you think differently so what does it matter that youve used more quotes than me what is hilarious is how you think debates work lol you dont see backing up your opinion with evidence as a part of a debate yeesh i have provided evidence lol the fact that you genuinly think you have is cute what evidence have you provided that states or even suggests that the starks are more respected than the other lords of westeros what evidence have you provided that states or even suggests that the northern vassals are more loyal than the other vassals of the other realms of westeros id love to see what evidence you have for this because so far you have provided bupkis you can just keep belligerently lying about what ive said it doesnt make it true lol belligerently that is the time you have used that word in this exchange your vocab seems to be pretty limited and for the third time the fact that he obeyed after being threatened is not evidence enough to suggest that he follows robb out of fear rather than out of respect yeah it really is he refused to do something has his fingers bitten off and threatened to be killed and than he stops refusing its pretty fucking clear not only that but the fact that robb felt the need to threaten one of his vassals into obeying him is pretty telling see this is your problem ive said this multiple times and instead of responding to the point you just keep repeating your initial point why would i not robb felt he needed to threaten one of his vassals to get him to obey and the greatjon only obeyed him after he was threatened and it is not like this is an isolated incident lady dustin mentions she only sent men because she was fearful of house stark im sorry that you dont understand how a feudal realm operates vassals are fearful of the consequences of refusing to obey their lords reading real history is fun it will help you bridge a lot of the aspects of the series you are missing may i recommend david starkey he too has a love for the word belligerent though he does not abuse it so much in conversation i have no you really have not youve resorted to ad hominem and strawman retorts quite quickly actually with no attempt to try and prove your point the quote is lamenting robbs absence yup he abandoned the north and it was much worse for it that is not admiration for robb stark he had failed his duty to protect winterfell and the north by as the liddle says playing the game of thrones because the smallfolk lovedadmired the starks sure all starks it comes with the territory your argument that ned and robb were so home regarded higher they were not it is the same in every realm the ruling families are lovedadmired by the smallfolk its funny how dishonest you are because were talking about how the people under the starks generally see them favorably when did i claim otherwise it was you who claimed that ned and robb had a special relationship that other previous starks and other ruling houses of other realms did noot share with their vassals now who is being dishonest or are you retracting that claim im going to take that as a yes you have retracted your earlier point as you have finally realized how idiotic it sounded and i provide a quote from somebody saying that people are better off when the starks are in charge lol robb was in charge at that point he was still alive all the shit that befell the north happened because robb had abandoned the north that is what the liddle is talking about starks should be in wintefell ruling the north keeping it safe supporting the wall and preparing fro winter robb ignored all of this a petty argument could be made that ned to abandoned the north to go and be hand but i think the liddle is only talking about robbs failings not his fathers and you say see shes mad that robb left winterfell lol she it was a dude who said that and yes the liddle is angry that robb had gone to play the game of thrones as stripping the north of its military has left the north badly exposed to attacks jesus christ dude try to be a little more intellectually honest sure keep on telling yourself that what is hilarious is how desperately deny the obvious in an attempt to win an internet argument i have already won you have refused to even try to defend your original point i have remained consistent ned and robb stark are no more and no less special than the average lord of the north or any other realm they had no special relationship however since you have long since given up the pretense of proving this point forever moving the goalposts i guess you have given up on this and here you are wasting time taking one sentence out of a paragraph to get in a cheap jab while ignoring the parts of the paragraph that actually matter im at work not only am i enjoying this conversation but im getting paid for it thanks for the replies they have been very amusing this shows how little you care about having an actual discussion here was the whole quote lol you have now quotes yourself more times than you have quotes the books see a perfectly reasonable thing to say but you being belligerent and obstinate pick out the first sentence and make some stupid pointless jab while ignoring the important part hahaha this is too much what kind of person not only quotes themself but then states that they are the reasonable one while the other is not just how deluded are you are you haha goodman by any chance as he is the only person on the internet i have seen with so little self awareness using your own quote as evidence that you are right has to be the funniest thing i have seen on reddit how the fuck have you so little karma he did so because he slept with jeyne westerling to preserve both his own honor and hers wait he slept with a woman he was not married to a woman who was his prisoner dude that is dishonorable as is agreeing to marry a frey and then backing out ned was hugely honorable robb is no more honorable than then average westerosi lord and as always everybody pretty much agrees with me lol other fans agree with me so i must be right shit dude lets face it youre delusional if you think ned and robb werent especially honorable men reading comprehension is not your strongest strnegth is it read back i have been quite clear that ned was a very honorable man ned was robb was not especially honorable he was as honourable as the average westerosi lord though once again this is a case of you moving the goal posts i am not sure what this has to do with your original argument you know the one you have refused to try and defend that the stark vassals were more loyal to robb and ned than any other house was to their lords no in fact its not it would be like using quotes from people on political message boards i didnt go to wwwilovethestarkscom im sorry but your logic is just terribly flawed here yeah you did the starks are the protagonists of the story they quote rightly have more fans than any other house possibly combined as the story is mostly told from their perspective arya sansa and bran are children who have been fucked over by a cruel world and they seem to be three of the central characters to the series this is a fandom starks have rightly so more fans than anyone else but lets not pretend that many fans dont judge something based on their preferences well if you would actually read what im writing instead of ignoring it in favor of making vapid cheap shots you would see exactly why im looking at the rest of the community yes rather than quote the books to back up your point you would rather quote up other people who share your opinion why not just go the full hog and ask one of them to discuss this on your behalf instead ill try one more time but you probably still wont get it lol in the same paragraph you lambaste someone for making cheap shots you make a pretty cheap shot yourself dude you are the best this is a highly sentimental topic yup that much we agree on many people have their opinion clouded by sentimentally it is the classic my dads better than your dad argument the starks cant be just like every other ruler they need to be special have a superior relationship i dont see anything wrong with this all fandoms do so but some are a little more emotionally honest about it
asoiaf,removed,its something that you get a feel for from reading thousands of pages lol that is the best you can up with thousands of pages and you still not come up with any actual evidence just a vague feeling they do then you made mention of people in this thread no you did you claimed that you must be right as more people had upvoted an earlier comment is your memory slipping the fact that everybody else seems to have come away with the same conclusion everybody lol really everybody would indicate to a rational person that maybe theyre missing something or just being deliberately obtuse you keep on claiming everyone agrees with you who told you this they dont m not the one denying what everybody else accepts as truth without strong evidence seriously virtually nobody denies that the starks including robb were honorable but you do because why quote me were i have said the starks were not honorable i have been very clear ned is extremely honorable and robb as honorable as any other lord in westeros why do you keep on making up arguments no one has made is this the only way you can win edit as for my comment karma maybe i should be making more posts like this one of yours i know right it shows how easy it is to get upvoted and gilded on reddit is upvotes mean fuck all that was why i was surprised when you initially suggested that you must be right because you had a few people upvoting your comment so i pointed out that my comments were being upvoted before it got too deep in the comment chain lol now you are trying to rewrite history you brought up vote scores and other peoples opinion as evidence that you must be right i remember it quite clearly as once again i pretty naively in retrospect asked for you to provide evidence for your ridiculous opinion you then replied you must be right as someone on reddit upvoted your comment reddit the place that gilds and awards karma for shit posting like quote of mine you posted not sure how this is debatable or controversial but again this is just how you seem to be so its not that surprising anymore it is not i have never made the arguments you are claiming i have made not once have i said the starks lack honor cant accept being wrong so you just get kind of annoying and stubborn wait you invent an argument that i have never made and now i am being stubborn for what exactly and do you not see the irony in calling me stubborn that is clearly a trait we both have displayed in this discussion though in my defense i am genuinely enjoying it i hope you are as well incorrect no it is correct you claimed the greatjon refused to swear fealty to roose if it happened provide the quote or dont and quote some other redditor as evidence gee i wonder why hother umber was supporting the boltons im sure it has nothing to do with the greatjon being held prisoner by the freys and didnt the other uncle team up with stannis no umbers went to help the starks at winterfell the karstarks who are further away did the fints who are further away did as did a few other houses who all answered the call when the starks were in trouble the umbers who you give an example of a house who are especially loyal did not not only did robb need to threaten his life to get him to obey but the umbers refused to help winterfell when it needed it i mispoke and should have said the umbers reluctance but what kind of quote do you want hother swore fealty to the boltons while the greatjon was being held prisoner is that not evidence of reluctance when did i declare they were not reluctant here we go once again with you trying to change the argument the umbers are not especially loyal though id love to see you try and use some evidence to try and prove that they were oh shit another quote you must be winning super hard now thanks it is good to see you admit that dont give up just yet though slugger i am sure you will find someone online who will agree with you no matter that it has zero relevance to the discussion of course sure it does in one of my first replies to you i pointed out that the umbers are no more loyal than the average house just that the the greatjon is louder thus giving the impression that he is more loyal just like a cheerleader alys karstark seems to share my opinion on the greatjon just being loud this is flat out stupid you think the clear majority of fans feel this way with zero evidence in the books lol the majority have you polled them and by the way there are plenty of people who dont even like the starks who agree that they were honorable and that their subjects and vassals respectedloved them im one of them i share that very opinion just that they were no more lovedrespected than the average lord it was their leaders who made the decision so yes it is a small handful of people sure that shows that the vast majority of the northern men with roose were indifferent to robb stark
asoiaf,removed,cersei would find lena headey too plain of face to be playing her that only depends on what book cersei looks like in your mind theres no assigned face for book cersei except that she has gold hair and green eyes which show cersei does have so this is just your dumb opinion and nothing else
asoiaf,removed,pls george save us
asoiaf,removed,wow sorry for defending a character you dont like you have to treat me like im an idiot because of that with your high horse bullshit rhetorical question
asoiaf,removed,what a bellend you are the level of entitlement on this forum is pretty disgusting this persons here trying to spread some positive energy giving thanks for an author who revived their passion for reading and the top comment with way too many net points is well sorry but youre gonna be disappointed that you dont get an immediate conclusion after reading a book series that has over words op asoiaf is nothing like this there is plenty of satisfaction within the books to be had if youre a grumpy ahole who wants everything on a plate in front of them yesterday sure then asoiaf is a waste of time but given that such negative people are still lurking around here looking to throw shade on your happiness about these books despite their negative attitude i think that tells you more than you need to know about how good these books are and how much youre going to enjoy the rest of them as for the rest of you focusing only on the fact that the final books are slow to release go take a walk go make love to your partner go write something of your own go to the gym find something else in life to focus your energies on stop shitting on a book series that has you lurking on its forums many years afte rthe last book was released
asoiaf,removed,hey stop your boring questions you are seriously making this place shitty
asoiaf,removed,you must be new here this has been done to death just wait and enjoy the story unfold also stop posting vague questions every few hours you and others like u are making it difficult to find interesting reading material
asoiaf,removed,not to be crude but is showsansas rack fake then
asoiaf,removed,a small idea he said it has to do with a character that is dead on the show but still alive in the books which could be several different characters most seem to think stannis or mance
asoiaf,removed,tits mcgee
asoiaf,removed,lol ur a joke
asoiaf,removed,oh sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,some guy who said he was an extra claimed that bran is possesed by the knights king and kills sansa while jon is gone
asoiaf,removed,that was the link you can see i commented lies god damn lies on there before it was removed
asoiaf,removed,thats what i thought but he knew that jon was going to be gone before it was verified with the leaks i think makes me nervous
asoiaf,removed,that bran would be possesed by the nights king that benjen was a baddy all along and that it was the plan for bran to escape to south of the wall so he could get close to jon and then kill him but since jon is gone he kills sansa instead
asoiaf,removed,oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,well this has been discussed as nasueaum so im going to assume youre new welcome to the sub if stannis dies like the show there is no heir in the line except another bastard we do not know if rhaegar and lyanna got married or not if you think the build up of the mystery for books about jon snows parentage makes no difference you must be reading a different book than i am
asoiaf,removed,the entire season synopsis was leaked yesterday or day before
asoiaf,removed,im more interested in seeing how arya will be up to with baelish im so ready to see her slaying his lies oh wait its dany whos the official title holder of slayer of lies isnt it
asoiaf,removed,hey selmy was dismissed i wouldnt call it a betrayal
asoiaf,removed,his oath to the crown has been rendered null and void hes free to give his sword and counsel to whoever he wants i feel like he can back dany and still keep his honor of course i doubt the crown would feel the same and hes now their enemy either way
asoiaf,removed,see httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpborosblount
asoiaf,removed,i am not sure if i would brand arys death as a heros death
asoiaf,removed,wonder what tormund is up to
asoiaf,removed,pmd
asoiaf,removed,pmd
asoiaf,removed,goddamn it this is another part of those awful leaks that have been confirmed
asoiaf,removed,that was an odd circumstance though blount is literally useless for anything else and the lannisters spit upon the kingsguard especially cersei
asoiaf,removed,id like some of whatever youre smoking must be powerful shit
asoiaf,removed,sell that to the panicking crowd that bellows spoiler with every picture from the production or the conspiracy nuts that think dd have the time or the interest to produce misdirection shoots
asoiaf,removed,except youre trying to spin that a year tradition and allowance of incest in westoros proves that polygamy which was only actually allowed once to a guy who had done it before he ever stepped foot in westoros years ago as being the same thing incest is illegal too incest however has multiple clear cases where people looked the other way and allowed it polygamy does not polygamy has the opposite where there are multiple clear cases where people specifically did not look the other way or did the crown tell the faith to make an exception for their family so they could continue to keep their bloodlines pure once we establish this your arguement starts to fold in on itself because it becomes clear that the crown is in charge of governing or there would be no special exceptions for incest you really are having trouble with your targaryen history despite pretending to be an expert on it of course the crown is running things that was literally the extent of the deal jaehaerys i made with them years before house targaryen was made defenders of the faith sworn to uphold and defend the faith the faith acquiesces to the crown because the faith holds no power anymore and they have a deal that the crown will take care of issues for them the crown is definetely running things at the time of rhaegar and lyanna and no evidence cited makes it impossible to marry even if its just through targaryen ritual except of course that rhaegar is not the crown you mean that is aerys if rhaegar wants to go around breaking the law he needs aerys permission moreover there is no such thing as targaryen ritual valyria was specifically noted as having a multitude of religions from different regions with none of them being dominant or enforced as no one was particularly religious there is no valyrian ceremony that visenya invented for maegor and alys because there was no valyrian religion she literally just said you guys are married not that that even matters because again what maegor did prior to jaehaerys is deal with the faith to be defenders of the faith does not at all feature the same circumstances that rhaegar faced as maegor wasnt legally bound to be a follower of the faith like rhaegar was maegor can go do something in a different religion but rhaegar was a follower of the faith and bound to obey its laws and tenets and of course the larger evidence being that you know polygamy has never been allowed in westoros and its been years since the last polygamist who was never even acknowledged as having multiple wives and was exiled stripped of his titles and murdered for it great example to try and claim precedence of other than literally everything pointing that its impossible that they married then sure no evidence makes it impossible that they married
asoiaf,removed,forget all this hillary clinton bullshit this is what wikileaks needs to be working on s
asoiaf,removed,guys if i happened to send grrm a message that will most likely result in him giving me a huge telling off will you guys support me and be here for me and make me feel better or just make me feel worse about myself because i already sent it i straight up asked him if writing is going well and that i just need to know if its coming out next year or not please tell me he wont scold me hes scolded me before
asoiaf,removed,because people will do anything for karma and id rather have actual discussions of asoiaf rather then very sketchy stories without a shred of proof kay
asoiaf,removed,well thats not the issue im pointing out its that its been a full day since he promised to post a photo how hard is it exactly to post a photo oh well ops got his attention and its too late
asoiaf,removed,as long as the skags teach him to zigzag hell make out okay
asoiaf,removed,i absolutely despise some of the decisions that the characters make balon greyjoy is offered a deal side with the starks and robb renounces all claim to the iron islands and make balon king what does balon fucking do he declares war on robb to make himself king with literally no fucking reason to do so at this point in time robb was winning youre being offered something and you decide to steal it anyway dumbest decision in all of the series but the second dumbest has to belong to renly nigga you have no claim you never had a claim stannis made you an awesome offer he would put you on the council and name you his heir but with no reason you refuse to bend the knee to your older brother who you know is stubborn what the fuck man you could have saved your life and become lord of high garden and the storm lands and even king if stannis were to not have a son the war would have been won in a second but you got greedy
asoiaf,removed,if the night king is a stark hes been alive for a pretty long fucking time all men must die
asoiaf,removed,the next time we see each other well talk about your mother ned stark to jon ive thought about this scene and quote a lot neds body language during this scene tells me something is not right he seems to have a difficult time saying this to jon he is uneasy as i assume an honorable man would have a hard time lying to his son not to say that he knew he would die because i really dont think he could have predicted that but i get the string impression ned somehow knew he was lying to jon and that they would not ever have the opportunity again in the future where they would meet again
asoiaf,removed,i was under the impression that its been atutum since the beginning of acok when cressen gets the white raven to the end of adwd when kevan sees the white raven just before he dies
asoiaf,removed,heres a friendly reminder you forgot to take your pills
asoiaf,removed,i dont want to get political but i am i personally dislike hillary clinton as a person but in my opinion shes a way better candidate than trump its likely that i will vote for hillary the whole lesser of two evils thing now if hillary asked me to personally fight for her to fight for house clinton of little rock i will laugh and walk away if she asked me to just vote for her ill be like why should i and then she says do want to vote for trump and then ill immediately vote for her lets ignore the third parties for this scenario trump is aerys in this scenario and clinton is robert here both suck but one is clearly better then you ask what about rhaegar well fuck this destroys my analogy but you get the point voting for someone in a legitimate forum is much easier and requires less commitment than actually getting your weapon and risking your life to commit treason
asoiaf,removed,do u need medical attention
asoiaf,removed,someone do obama
asoiaf,removed,a distant lannister cousin unexpectedly gained lordship of castelly rock along with its immense wealth he took this opportunity to build new structures and castles across the land and made sure that his name was well known for the construction of these magnificent structures he had castelly rock booming with gold and had income rolling in from across the land though his lordship was controversial he fathered several bastard children though he had several true born sons through his young wives who kept disappearing years and years later the iron throne was vacant and he decided to make his claim he claimed he could make westeros great again and he wanted to build a wall similar to the wall in the north but this one made of gold and to block the dornish people from entering the rest of westeros he said it would be yuuuuge
asoiaf,removed,daenerys targaryen she is like donald trump she wants to rule a land she is completely out of touch with first she falls in love with a man she is sold to then she revels in the murder of her brother as well deserved as it is viserys is her only family she defies nature and resurrects her husband as a zombie only to rekill him she locks her dragons her babies in a dungeon which broke my heart and she is the worst ruler ever she does not try to understand the meereenese or yunkai she imposes her own moral values on them and expects obedience to her ways i dont agree with slavery but you cant invade a country you know nothing about and order them to follow your rules thatd be hitler stalin or mussolini i think shes crazy and anti feminist so i dont understand all the women i know loving her its like her dragons are the cool horses every young girl wanted so they are blind to her ill take arya and her reliance on herself coupled with a thirst for knowledge that gives her independence or brienne who only wants to do right but is also a woman who wants to be loved and she can kick anyones ass the list of truly cool chicks is long and an inbred megalomaniac has no place on it
asoiaf,removed,dude your friend is officially heterosexual most people are sad when robb dies because they can imagine getting fucked by his glorious manhood
asoiaf,removed,lord smallhands of house trump
asoiaf,removed,shut up you whiney bull shitting grand standing dick
asoiaf,removed,trumps oresidencial promises joking aside probably something about azor ahai or the prince that was promised
asoiaf,removed,this is so very pointless technically no it wouldnt be english since england isnt on planetos but it very may well be that the words are exactly the same is it possible to find out no does it matter at all no how bored do you have to be to ask this very
asoiaf,removed,youre a troll thats why done now byeeeee
asoiaf,removed,im trying when their post is questioning my integrity and insulting my intelligence its hard not to respond in kind
asoiaf,removed,i doubt jon will die again too repetitive id love for someone to kill dany though that targ bitch has it coming
asoiaf,removed,why would jon snows death his story has no purpose if he cant offer something in war for the dawn and what he can offer dragon or soldiers after aegon hes the heir to the throne robb also made him king in the north hes going to be fielding massive armies by series end coming because you like jon snow because danys fucking nuts shes a spoiled little girl who was planning to usurp her brother burns people alive crucifies them and is planning to take westeros as a foreign conqueror by fire and blood because she thinks she deserves it her internal monologues betray a savage delusional woman
asoiaf,removed,get this fag a tissue
asoiaf,removed,those are some terribly worded questions first of all are you implying that she needs a sword to do what shave her cunt hairs if shes azor ahai drogon will be her lightbringer also you better believe that dany is going to get nerfed next season euron is going to do his damage and cersei might put the nail in the coffin of whats left of her army when she gets to kings landing so what will jon have to offer hell probably be commanding almost half of whats left of the armies of westeros with the north the vale possibly the riverlands
asoiaf,removed,i wonder what hurts him more the fact dd raped his storyplot or the fact that a raped show is still that successful
asoiaf,removed,grrm plz
asoiaf,removed,wow he praised dan and dave according to this reddit he hates those guys
asoiaf,removed,idk man it was a little lack luster in my opinion the way they treated events felt like they were rushing through things and that they were just checking things off a list rather than letting the story breath and grow it seems like no one reacts to things so much stuff happened this season and i was looking forward to how other people handled it and i never got this its a fucking giant fighting in this battle not one person reacted or that no one cares that the lord commander of the nights watch seemingly broke his vows jon asks for a small force in a earlier season to bring mutineers to justice and the second scene of the show is ned executing a deserter of three nights watch so that says how serious this offense is in the north yet no one even mentions it hell they even name the man kingindanorf
asoiaf,removed,yet the karstarks think of robb as a kinslayer when the level of relatedness between them and robb is far less than that between robert and rhaegar
asoiaf,removed,pretty much yes there have been enough changes to character arcs sansa daenerys and jaime in particular that they just dont feel like the same people in the books anymore to me and i care about and understand these guys less and some of the narrative changes like putting so much focus on margaery and her thing with the high sparrow just came to fuckall in the end and dont make a lot of sense to me from a storytelling perspective like they originally wanted to do something different with her but had to get rid of her and the direwolves in a hurry to set the stage for next season
asoiaf,removed,make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,lol brayeen is nonsensical sounds like some retarded gangsta pronunciation
asoiaf,removed,coldhands benjen until benioff and weiss resurrected the theory on tv
asoiaf,removed,he needs to cut out football the games are way too long he needs to be writing
asoiaf,removed,im psyched for i was meh going into season but i went back and watched it all and wasnt at all disappointed the facts that now dany is headed for westeros and bran is the three eyed raven has me brimming with anticipation actually that sounded kinda nasty sorry but you know what i mean theres a beast that lives inside every man and he stirs when you put a sword in his hand i wish you good fortune in the wars to come for the night is dark and full of terrors
asoiaf,removed,i think it is clear that the only person who is stupid in this post is op uses the wrong contraction then puts forward baseless accusations about jaime wanting to help his father just because he feels that way
asoiaf,removed,i removed your comment bc of the second sentence you can still see your comment when it is removed but others cant
asoiaf,removed,your stupid
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,im so annoyed with how the show ruined barristans character he didnt get a super badass moment like this and he deserved one
asoiaf,removed,you root and cheer for him because he is a pov character thats also another point were the story told from slynts pov from the start youd have a different opinion its not what we think to be justice that matters cheering for someone to chop a head off shows the flaw in all of us we would be disgusted by the notion of a beheading happening today in the modern world but we are okay with it when our favorite pov character does it and we cheer for it you see thats exactly how some people cheer for a beheading that happens today in places like saudi arabia or the isis to wrap up we really always decide whats right based on our limited pov regardless of a bigger picture or what is human jamie is a terrible person and has a worst reputation than slynt if you switch their places and give jamie no pov chapters then youd be cheering for jon cutting his head off too
asoiaf,removed,but the books and show are in completly different places i cant think of any logcial solution where the characters in the books would reach where they are in the show considering how adwd ended jons death in season was simple some nights watch were unhappy about the wildlings being let through so they stabbed him in the book its complete chaos at the wall you have the black brothers tormung and a bunch of wildlings who were preparing to go to hardhome wun wun killing some knight selyse and her men val bowen marsh and co plus jon just got everyone insanely hyped to get support to march on winterfell i see no way home melisanre and davos will resurrect him and then jon hangs a few fools and him and sansa go get ready to march on winterfell who knows how jons story will go maybe he never really becomes kitn until the others attack maybe stannis beats the boltons and restores the north the only thing that could really be spoiled would be a hodor chapter with the hold the door reveal that would however get a lot of spoilers away as in the books the whole bran situation is pretty different
asoiaf,removed,if you didnt realise bloodraven skinchanged the boar then youre an idiot
asoiaf,removed,that was sarcasm you cunt
asoiaf,removed,it isnt funny or cute to be insufferably rude to people you just look childish
asoiaf,removed,jesus christ dude stop getting your panties in a bunch its not even relevant to the argument let it go
asoiaf,removed,in the show she is like im khalessi the mother of dragonsi do this i do that just total bullshit in the books you feel like she ishuman
asoiaf,removed,the nice thing about dany chapters is everyone in the story seems to think she is this super confident ruler that always knows what to do but the pov chapters illustrate that she is often confused and much more human its hard to get that vibe out of the show which is why so many people dislike the show character the book character is much better and you definitely should not skip her chapters
asoiaf,removed,i hate her chapters in adwd but in agot they are so good man i love viserys and drogo
asoiaf,removed,although i like her in the show not a top favorite though i think this last season has been the worst for dany those hype speeches she gives to her men can be cringey like the one on the back of the dragon
asoiaf,removed,and the story is cool she meets a lot of interesting characters like daario naharis barristan selmy qaithe and all these so fucking weird cities in essos
asoiaf,removed,youre gonna miss the house of the undying
asoiaf,removed,is it much different than the show im on page like of affc and he hasnt even showed up in like books i think
asoiaf,removed,aryas storyline actually goes into acok material at the end of season
asoiaf,removed,whoa spoilers uautomoderator you could at least tag it s were updating the spoiler tags tomorrow
asoiaf,removed,i wouldnt mind waiting so long if he actually communicated with his fans blog posts about his cinema dont count i dont see the harm in giving us updates other than giving us high expectations also i really dont like how hes previously said if he dies that his wife will burn everythingthats kind of shitty considering hes a very slow writer i think fans deserve an ending to the book if something terrible happens to him hopefully it never reaches that stage but with his age and his health based of appearance its looking like a harsh reality
asoiaf,removed,i think the most frustrating thing will be when we just finish twow the story will still be incomplete and ados will be at least another or years away while our morbidly obese year old overlord goes on a world tour and takes another year break i legitimately think hell never finish the story either hell die before that or hell just give up hes clearly tired of it i think he once had the chance of having a legacy comparable to tolkiens but unless he starts writing at least twice as fast overnight thats long gone
asoiaf,removed,wait did you remove my other reply to you why
asoiaf,removed,seriously wtf why do you keep removing my comments
asoiaf,removed,what mystery hes a slow writer been reading since and honestly im over it now he will most likely die before he finishes this series
asoiaf,removed,shut the fuck up and let the man work holy shit stop with that whole ill read from an author that can be counted on ummm wtf counted on for what entitled peace of shit
asoiaf,removed,itt a bunch of spoiled children hating on an author because they love his work
asoiaf,removed,authors who can be counted on to be incredibly frank i find this kind of entitled whinging to be absolutely disgusting its entertainment you have every right to be disappointed its taking so long but ripping him personally for not releasing it in the time frame that you would like is downright childish i am sick and tired of listening to all the crying about grrms slow writing hes not making food water electricity or medicine its entertainment enjoy it when it comes i want to see everything finished as much as you do im excited but im not going to personally insult him for being slow or let it negatively impact my life when it launches ill enjoy it for what it is and thats what it will be if he never finishes the series maybe someone else will pick it up and wrap it up if they dont thats ok disappointing but ok its just entertainment some people act like hes somehow doing something terrible in your life by not providing you the entertainment you want in the time frame you desire grow the hell up quit your childish whining
asoiaf,removed,well a bunch of them already did at the green trial
asoiaf,removed,you reminded me of also from a while back wherein i tried to analyse his writing speed at the time i thought i was being a little pessimistic assuming its as long as a dance with dragons we can reckon the publication date for the winds of winter to be may but i wasnt pessimistic enough did you know that hes written roughly words a day since january if hed kept to words a day dance would have been published on march terry pratchett and thats not including several nondiscworld books and all the various media involvements that apparently take up so much time grrm is a fucking weekender
asoiaf,removed,no it wasnt you just assumed because you didnt get the reference its fine we dont all read the same shit dont be that guy
asoiaf,removed,personally id wait for the initial reaction from the fans id likely get spoiled but thats a price im willing to pay to avoid reading trash mascaraing as asoiaf i wont mention the show i wont mention the show i wont mention the show id have to just be content with spoilers if the consensus is that its not as good this is obviously based off the fact that grrm has a list of all of the plot resolutions somewhere and the writer is just playing connect the dots poorly
asoiaf,removed,i am a bot providing a warning this comment contains the words tree fiddy if it is a story you have been warned proceed with caution message me to remove this comment or add a new copypasta
asoiaf,removed,so its not that we renamed everything this time the way we did with all we just got rid of it entirely why though it was by far the most popular tag also why was my other comment itt removed
asoiaf,removed,i want to kill myself after reading this
asoiaf,removed,well maybe they should post their own threads instead of whining about what the majority of content providers are giving them
asoiaf,removed,maybe it would have been more interesting this way but the continuity with onscreen talent would be a concern anyhow bran wasnt in season at all but thats the only major omission as far as the cast is concerned and also as far as im aware
asoiaf,removed,rwhitewalkers
asoiaf,removed,shut the fuck up
asoiaf,removed,no fucking way i know you those of you who cant distinguish between good and bad writing think that he did a good job on wot he didnt but he doesnt have the talent or the historical knowledge to pull of a series like asoiaf never end of fucking story
asoiaf,removed,good morrow do you know where whores go
asoiaf,removed,see bernie of house sanders
asoiaf,removed,hes only assuming he doesnt get cancer or something similar if he stays in ok health hes got plenty of time left
asoiaf,removed,every day i wake up in the morning and check the internet to see if winter has come for george
asoiaf,removed,you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,will people fuck off with this grrm is hes not terminally ill winds wont take more than another two years and ados might take or presumably once twow brings all the characters back together it will be more straightforward writing it the series will be finished
asoiaf,removed,i doubt hes going to live that long every downvote to this post will take a month off his life every upvote will add a month have fun
asoiaf,removed,this is basically it nothing he could write could possibly live up to the hypeso hes basically stalling til he dies then we all just get to wonder what could have beenwhich honestly is probably a better way to go out
asoiaf,removed,ill make mexico pay for it
asoiaf,removed,the faster he dies the more likely we are to see a published end to the series written by someone else mind you but way faster
asoiaf,removed,elio and linda will probably be the ones to do it i would buy up all the copies of ados in my area and throw a huge bonfire
asoiaf,removed,what is this bullshit
asoiaf,removed,i wouldnt mind seeing translucent millimeter thin clothes on those high school students
asoiaf,removed,if against all odds he changes his mind elio and linda will probably be the ones to do it fuck me id rather have no ending at all then jesus fucking christ
asoiaf,removed,not while hes alive but i think hes even said that after hes dead he doesnt care what happens
asoiaf,removed,could you send me a link to it pm is fine if you prefer
asoiaf,removed,send link please
asoiaf,removed,and then deep in stella
asoiaf,removed,theres other places for fanfiction
asoiaf,removed,i like to talk about this stuff because i have a degree in it riamverysmart you dont need to tell us about your amazing credentials when were arguing about a movie over the internet of all things seriously though what did i say that made it seem like i was enraged or whatever and what was there to suggest that you loved the movie when everything you said was criticizing the liberties the movie took how about its just a film and if it gets a few things wrong you just ignore it and enjoy it it certainly did a better job science wise the any other film i know of oh and while were pointing out minor technicalities about the spaghettification stuff im pretty sure cooper didnt actually fall into the singularity gargantua was pretty big and he only fell into to it for a few minutes with a black hole that large it would probably take days or even weeks for him to get close to the point of being turned into spaghetti so we can infer that him ending up in the singularity was just more dimensional space magics
asoiaf,removed,grrm will die before we get to mars
asoiaf,removed,also collaborating with the grrm on that book allow them the legal ground one day to receive shared right toward the universe they could argue that they have helped build the universe so they have right toward it i think one of the author got in trouble because they interact so much with fanfiction writer that they end up using element of fanfiction that it end up with writer suing for shared right dick move on their part but this is a legal precedent that elio and linda can take advantage my prediction if you dont want eliolinda ados you pray that grrm finished before he dead or eliolinda bite the dust first
asoiaf,removed,these have to be the dumbest criticisms of the movie ive read you also missed the whole part how they unlocked the secret to gravity
asoiaf,removed,please oh so intelligent one please enlighten me on what its like to go through a worm hole
asoiaf,removed,neither of those things is likely to happen ever
asoiaf,removed,if he dies brandon sanderson could finish it
asoiaf,removed,good grief
asoiaf,removed,his penis is so powerful he has killed women with it
asoiaf,removed,she had no duty to love him this is true but she couldnt tell him that he should be the one lying in a comma bed dying and not her trueborn son bran even in a giant moment of grief this is no excusable because she was telling that to a child have you never said anything offensive at your weakest point so she said one offensive thing boo hoo who cares not a big deal in all honesty and i agree that being female omg babies are sooo is fucking retarded cat has no obligation to love some random bastard kid
asoiaf,removed,you are too obsessed with asoiaf if you care about the god damned pets its just a series of books dude
asoiaf,removed,good thing tyrion is a targaryen bastard
asoiaf,removed,you type that after downvote lmao gtfo you slut
asoiaf,removed,the second one was me after you typed it
asoiaf,removed,i posted my personal opinion to which i am very much entitled as you are to yours you dont have to agree with it as you vehemently have not but i dont appreciate being called dumb or having doubt cast about whether or not i read the books because my opinion doesnt align with yours thats fucking rude quite presumptive and very close minded thats probably why cat is your favorite character and certainly not mine my personal opinion of whats necessary and essential to being considered a good mother is quite simple unconditional love for yours for others for all its not a good life lesson to teach kids that only you and yours matter and basically fuck everyone else who isnt which is what youre trying to justify heres another life lesson that your mother obviously didnt teach you its not becoming of you to walk around and rudely verbally attack people who offer opinions that dont match your own its important to respect others opinions and they are as entitled to them as you are to yours and it is very possible to respectfully disagree with others instead of being an ignorant shit
asoiaf,removed,the argument is that hed have to know that even if he arranged for cersei to be set aside and got margaery married to robert which he admits he was trying to do margaerys children wouldnt be the ones to inherit the throne unless the lannisterborn children were pushed aside somehow how is that an argument at no point is it stated that he was trying to set aside roberts children he is trying to limit lannister power by replacing the queen not the royal children though the plan itself is pretty poorly thought out but after roberts death renly sees an opportunity for himself to actually be king not the man with an in with the queens family while the king drinks his days away actually no after roberts death his plan was for him and ned to rule via joffrey not make himself king

asoiaf,removed,a big portion of season plot has been leaked though
asoiaf,removed,its funny how cunts like you show your sorry ass here
asoiaf,removed,i disagree on the arya part shes a stone cold killer in the show while theres still a lot of humanity left to her in the books
asoiaf,removed,i have a pet whine as we are all aware there is a spoiler police out there and they is always telling us to hide what the books say or our speculations why do some people insist on being spoiled
asoiaf,removed,all the leaks seem true but man i dont fucking mind because this is being incredibly awesome kit is more sexy than never my body is ready my king in the north and i would cry in that scene if i were dany jorah and her only meet to say goodbye
asoiaf,removed,how come was this also leaked somewhere
asoiaf,removed,have you read the leaked script spoilers if that leak is true then they are going north to catch a zombie
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,thats like an auschwitz survivor championing adolf hitler
asoiaf,removed,is this for when isis comes into the show
asoiaf,removed,it likely will be due to the big guy biting the big one but the article you linked sounds sensationalist to me what website aimed exclusively at moms isnt i think george hopes to finish the series with a dream of spring
asoiaf,removed,fuck this old cunt
asoiaf,removed,fingers represent the new gods
asoiaf,removed,im going to reread the whole series and try to find this chlamydia gal youre talking about her character seems infectious
asoiaf,removed,chlamydia doesnt burn hot enough to melt steel beams
asoiaf,removed,i read this conversation in cadence for some reason
asoiaf,removed,you perverts need rhllor
asoiaf,removed,what just happened
asoiaf,removed,holy moly eight removed comments in a row what happened here
asoiaf,removed,the theory is that jaqen was to become a ranger at the wall go beyond it and look for bloodraven to find and kill him but once the glass candles started burning again stoping by oldtown and using it to locade brynden was easier
asoiaf,removed,not to be morbid but i kinda hope he dies before finishing the books the hype is too great to have a ending that lives up to it now
asoiaf,removed,i dont know but i think it is really suspicious that varys alterego is the head goaler the one that would likely have decided what prisoners the watch could have the alterego that ned barely recognized when varys revealed himself to ned if i am remembering correctly arya describes the way varys walks very simularly to how she describes how the waife or other servents in the house of black and white walk
asoiaf,removed,im totally with you on wanting the book to be great and being willing to wait for it what if his watch ends first
asoiaf,removed,finallysomebody sticks up for george rr martin and ayn rand on reddit go to rtool and tell them to quit talking aboutbeing excited about the upcoming new tool album its been years and these are the people who have hung around through the droughtmaynard and the band should appreciate that people are still tuning in george should too we sure hope you create a lot of art so that we can buy it assholes
asoiaf,removed,any rand can suck a bag of dicks in hell but op youd probably like this essay on martin by neil gaiman
asoiaf,removed,seethats the rubi dont think that many people are saying where is my book motherfucker on the other hand famous people have been known to let the fans know george rr martin is not your bitch heres a simple way of testing your theory make a post saying gosh wed like a new book and where is my book motherfuckerand see if either one gets any upvotes or much positive support most comments would probably be closer to yeah i cant wait for it either or the obvious grrm isnt your bitch next compare it to the leave george alone posts similar to yours and see which ones get more support upvotes and i agrees its a huge straw man at this point to defend george from the tens of people who have been rude with their rabid fandom or general ignorance even the lessthanclassy people who speculate on his death before the ending of the books arent trying to be trolls as much as they are averaging out the length of time per book and the average life span of an obese hedonist with deadlines its fair to speculate on that as it is fair to speculate on asoiaf theoriesand every bit as important george is one of my favorite authors and i put him right up there with tolkien on nearly every level but i dont know the guy and i have no more of a personal link to him than i do president obama or khloe kardashian grrm is missing cameos con appearances and writingshow opportunities because this book is important and we have little to no knowledge of the actual progress he has made at all asoiaf fans are going to speculate on a million silly thingsgeorges progress is the one of the main questions a lot of us would ask if we had an opportunity to ask one impatience with a story is brimming with mysteries some of which go back two decades is certainly to be expected
asoiaf,removed,hes been writing the series for years and there are still at least two books left considering that his pace has increasingly been getting slower and slower that hes years old and not exactly a very healthy guy im not sure why people still believe there will be an ending let alone a grat one
asoiaf,removed,she is absolutely positively not immune to fire you shownly pleb
asoiaf,removed,we know he played the warrior while under tywins command he appears totally in control in the hbw scenes so it seems out of character that he was caught killing someone in the show the faceless men seem to be pretty stupid assassins peeling off the mask before killing the victim etc but in the books theyre the ultimate assassins they get you before you know theyre even coming for you it could just as easily be he was falsely accused bad things happen to good assassins too
asoiaf,removed,sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°╯╲卐卐卐卐 dont mind me just taking my mods out for a walk﻿
asoiaf,removed,respectfully i wasnt being condescending in the slightest and i am completely surprised that i received this message i firmly stand behind that i used the phrase sweet summer child exactly how i understand many other users to use it which is as almost an inside joke of sorts to kid about how long it is taking grmm to come out with the next book in absolutely no way was i attempting to be sarcastic or condescending or any other derogatory adjective describing what would be an infraction in the rules and terms of service frankly if you are telling me that this phrase is used in a derogatory sense i am utterly surprised and will never use it again because if so i have been using it out of context and i am embarrassed to be put into any kind of negative category based on what i insist was a playful gesture that being said i apologize for the way my comment apparently came off i promise you that it will not happen again because i will never type that phrase again here
asoiaf,removed,a second thought i have is this isnt my original comment in response to someone who in humor said that ados will come out in like the i havent gone back to look so please sincerely correct me if i am mistaken but especially given the context of my statement i simply cant understand why i was flagged for this i was playing along with what i thought was a goodnatured jest i am beside myself that i was flagged for this comment
asoiaf,removed,because hes dead
asoiaf,removed,finish the book fuckhead
asoiaf,removed,this is some preston jacobs level fuckin shit here
asoiaf,removed,it sucks that theyre edited within an inch of their reigns it wouldve been included in twoiaf
asoiaf,removed,ffs
asoiaf,removed,yeah this seems to be the long and short of it i think many of the nw recruits while being criminals do have a sort of honor they were given a choice by the lordknight who sentenced them deathcastrationamputationetc or the wall they chose the wall so they really have accepted that this is their fate and arent going to try to run
asoiaf,removed,in wills defense he didnt seem to be the most qualified ranger the watch has ever produced gared though he probably would have made it across the narrow sea or many of the other more qualified rangers i guess the main issue is the men who have the abilities to escape the north are the ones loyal to the watch where as the ones who would want to escape seem to be the ones with no ability
asoiaf,removed,or worse blanket parties and gang rapes oh we hear you like to rape your brothers well just so happens your brothers like to rape you in a self policing unit im sure late night personal visits like the one jon almost got im sure they are very common with the more difficult recruitsmembers
asoiaf,removed,i mean if a cripple a simpleton and two crannogmen from the neck can sneak their way through the north albeit with the depleted state of the population and general chaos followingduring the war then i think a full grown man can manage as well
asoiaf,removed,for a murder new clothes are just a murder away
asoiaf,removed,new clothes can be found quite easily and its not like they have picturesfingerprintstattoos to mark them you see freeriders and mercenaries and sellswords all over westeros i mean maybe its one of those they never show the guy get away on cops because they want people to think no one can escape the police deals they dont talk about the people that escaped because it will give people hope and ideas
asoiaf,removed,jon is a special case he is highborn higher born that anyone else at the wall minus aemon and maybe aemon too if you want to debate he is mormonts personal steward hes being raised as the next lord commander for fucks sake and his reasons for leaving are the most public and important reasons there are his dad who is the warden of the north was just publicly executed for treason now take some nameless freerider or mercenary or serial killerrapist they arent going to watch them as closely they dont know they dont care they are just another recruit
asoiaf,removed,possible solutions steal horsefoodtoolsclothing steal a guide as a hostage in my scenario its assumed that the deserters do have a certain amount of skills so they can handle themselves not every recruit is a green pate pig boy the north is huge you come upon some cabin or some solo traveler its going to happen not everyone is in a tight nit community also merchants trade with the wildlings that means they travel north so its feasible that a nw hide near hardhome long enough to get a berth on a merchant ship to where ever the fuck and escape or just manage to sneak through the north and get to somewhere where they can get a berth on a ship and travel to where ever the fuck im sure it happens
asoiaf,removed,ollo killed mormont but yeah dirk known assassin of flea bottom youd think he would have escaped by then he obviously didnt want to be there and was far from loyal he also had the skills necessary to do so
asoiaf,removed,life as a paid merc looks way more attractive than any of those things especially for the likes of rorgebiterjaqen for the men without the fear of combat and the skills and experience the watch is a shitty deal tbh a trip across the narrow sea to any of the sell sword companies is much better
asoiaf,removed,its fake history man none of it is important maybe you should attempt to have fun with the story like everyone else
asoiaf,removed,mord turnkey mord mord
asoiaf,removed,just some more tidbits the only other qhorin i can find is qhorin volmark of house volmark who was a claiment for the heir of house hoare after the death of harren the black but was slain by aegon also harrens brother was lord commander hoare of the nights watch during aegons conquest but stayed loyal to the nw despite his family being killed by aegons dragons his givenfirst name is never stated perhaps its qhorin which is why arthur chose the name
asoiaf,removed,bitch this is a great theory i hadnt even thought it would be a dragon but thats totally true why introduce a plot device if youre not prepared to use it

asoiaf,removed,what a bitch post
asoiaf,removed,but ops theory is completely original and more in depth hes a special little flower s seriously though mods need to start adding theory megathreads immediately after new episodes and removing threads like this its wednesday everything has been dissected analyzed and discussed to death by this point this sub is an out of control shit show want to read about new theories regarding the latest episode see the megathread want to post your theory regarding the latest episode post it in the megathread it isnt that hard mods
asoiaf,removed,this theory is on uproxx already and they basically steal of their news from reddit i get it youre a casual rasoiaf browser but your theory has been posted probably once an hour since the episode aired
asoiaf,removed,one of the main things i thought while watching that botched farce the show claimed was a kingsmoot was how people on reddit would start drawing conclusions on it that effect the books sigh anyway just like dorne is a place of infinite stupidity in the show so to the iron islands go as well let us never pretend that anything weiss and benioff touch has actual implications for the books in the books the ironborn of course lack in some sophistication but theyre good at what theyre good at fighting sailing and building ships while some ironborn are clearly pretty dumb you could say the same about people everywhere rorge shagwell ramsays whole crew janos slynt chett all fine examples of dull minds that arent from the islands heres a better way to look at it common born people in all of planetos are stupid and since they all pretty much grow up without any schooling whatsoever it kinda makes sense doesnt it now is the leadership of the ironborn stupid well balon greyjoy didnt really have a great long term plan for his war but up until his death he was winning it give him a chance to hold moat cailen while bleeding robb down and he could of likely negotiated away cape kraken at a minimum well never know for sure theons are more emotional than mental and asha is as clever as about any other high born in westeros victorian sucks at politics and is mired in tradition but hes a hell of a commander and euron is more mysterious than anything meanwhile of the other lords we meet botley blacktyde merlyn and goodbrother dont seem any dumber than the rest of westeros and house harlaw would seem to boast the most educated lords in all of westeros as far as the kingsmoot goes some points should be given alone for being one of the few democratic assemblies in all of westeros as choosing a king that way seems just as good or better as letting a joffrey reach the throne on blood alone as for how the winner was chosen euron wasnt just charasmatic he was pretty much magic with a magical fire horn and tales of dragons and then proceeded to change the ironborn plan from successfully beating down the distracted north to successfully beating down the distracted reach anyway the moral hete is theyre a brutal people with a brutal religion and brutal way of life that matches the bleakness of thier land where piracy was just about the only way to get a natural resources but thats if you care about the books thanks to the show they will all pretty much be remembered for how retarded and lame them and their kingsmoot was thanks weiss and benioff
asoiaf,removed,your mothers a whore also nice theory
asoiaf,removed,ahhhh maaan no beeeeewbs
asoiaf,removed,yeah well ive seen that type before want to be a princess growing up acts like a total bitch to everyone except the boy she likes then will play innocent little girl the second she runs into trouble then when shes doing alright again youre an asshole in her eyes me and jon dont have time for stupid cunts like that im just sick of everyone acting like sansa is great name one thing that she has actually done she got her own dog killed while getting her sister in trouble and causing a huge divide between rob and ned then tried to blame arya what a cunt then she has to be married to joffery even when everyone is telling her she shouldnt she did pay the price for that though then after all of that she still didnt learn to not trust anyone and when confronted between torture and getting eaten by dogs or cro ssing a cold stream shes all like im too much of a little pussy bitch i cant do it to the guy who had his dick chopped off with almost no clothes on what a total cunt
asoiaf,removed,i like it but assholes from retard island will have the pc police up in arms better to just stick with dickhead island where we all still know the retard is silentce
asoiaf,removed,the fat man will read his own obituary
asoiaf,removed,in a donald trump rally i might say
asoiaf,removed,even suggesting it is asinine
asoiaf,removed,also there were rumors from a source that has been previously credible that benjen returns this season
asoiaf,removed,i want an add on that blocks preston jacobs from my internet browsing experience
asoiaf,removed,black americans murder eachother constantly and their population is growing like crazy guess ironborn women pop them out as much as shaniqua does
asoiaf,removed,aaaand there it is
asoiaf,removed,so is every single woman on reddit but you dont see them bitching aboutit trails off mumbling
asoiaf,removed,you cant say that even if it is true that she is dumb and that it is true that she is a bitch to everyone around her
asoiaf,removed,season spoilers below the story for the rest of this season has more or less been leaked riverrun gets sieged by the lannisters and blackfish gets killed offscreen jon and co are loosing the bastardbowl but then the knights of the vale sweep in and route karstark and umber forces ramsay falls back to winterfell wun wun breaches the front gate and sansa and littlefinger are both present as jon beats ramsay to a bloody pulp
asoiaf,removed,whats the difference between this and theon not being considered a son of balon after getting his penis cut off this and balon treating yara with better respect since theon hasnt achieved anything and doesnt behave like a true ironborn is this still a misogynist dichotomy now go take your feminist bullshit out of here
asoiaf,removed,hey hellostarsailor nice comment do you choke your mother with it when you put your penis in her butthole

asoiaf,removed,you sound like a ridiculous feminist tyrion was treated the exact same and made to marry sansa most men of high families are made to marry people they dont want to not everything is about gender
asoiaf,removed,just so we get to see tittays
asoiaf,removed,i never saw that scene as rape ive dated a chick or two whom do the whole oh no stopppp as im initiating thing there is a difference between real no which you always respect and the oh no dont overpower me please no that some women are into plus safe words that scene felt very stop dont stop but stahhhhppp
asoiaf,removed,you clearly have no clue what youre talking about how about before passing off the show as shit you watch it gosh people like you man the worst
asoiaf,removed,watching any show isnt a job or something that you have to do if youre not enjoying it then move on no one gives a shit what you think though stop watching no one cares next time dont post this if youre not into a show or motivated to watch it dont
asoiaf,removed,so apparently you are an old man who reads a lot of books and talks shit online all day lol fucken faggot i thought old people were supposed to mature at some point your life must suck so bad i see not finding any lovesex in rhistoryporn and rbooks i see its ok death will take a hold of you soon and you wont have to be alone anymore

asoiaf,removed,close up vag shot plz
asoiaf,removed,my nigga thanks
asoiaf,removed,so were just supposed to ignore that a supposedly secret location was leaked by a ghost it is important it directly affected the story ned never finds the place which means he never finds his sister which in turn means the three remaining members of weeks kingsguard live they probably take jon and raise him themselves alongside dany and viserys that would have made the storyline change just because your willing to stick your head in the sand and pretend doesnt mean the rest of us have to do the same its called attention to detail
asoiaf,removed,in what way was that condescending because we want clarification
asoiaf,removed,posted in a spoilers infinite post last night waiting for mod approval heres a copypasta hopefully its allowed in spoilers production

asoiaf,removed,ive actually been drugfree since december we were discussing whether she passed the food through undigested or if she digested it anyway whether her body still produced bile and the required enzymes etc i was thinking about what if she just passed the food through her body undigested and one thought led to anotherand i thought of a great way to make a bunch of tooserious asoiaf fans imagine an old lady feeding jon snow babybird style with her ass so i had to do it
asoiaf,removed,depending on the strength of his flow it might be possible to do it just by directing the stream at his mouth at a point when hes inhaling for instance euron may be laughing over him and when he catches his breath aeron lets go with a firehoselike stream of urine note that its possible for a person to inhale water cough up all the water and then drown several minutes later because it can affect the fluid balance in your lungs its not uncommon at all or maybe aeron manages to capture and restrain euron and euron taunts him telling him that he would never kill his own brother because he is such a godly man aeron then tells him of his technicality
asoiaf,removed,because their current method has made for pretty bad television but hey stupid people will defend stupid writing
asoiaf,removed,because you have someodd minutes per episode to tell a fucking story which is the same reason there will be no lady stoneheart despite half the numbskulls here including probably you believing shell show up flashback or hallucination would be entirely appropriate but irrelevant to the resolution of the waif problem jaqen stealing syrios face and using it when saving arya makes no fucking sense you explain how it makes narrative sense to explain that he stole his face and waited til now to use it worst fucking most complicated explanation possible jaqen being a creation of syrio a faceless man is not ruled out by my argument and makes somewhat sense in denying arya additional comfort in her training this would require he survive his fight with meryn trant three of those four are reasonably likely and of two of those three one is contingent upon the other i excluded one from my initial argument you set up a retarded fucking straw man to try to make yourself feel better about having a shit grasp on narrative logic its not going to be a hallucination its not jaqen stealing syrios fucking face and cracking it for years to wipe the shit off it just to save arya its one of two possibilities syrio or another braavosi saving arya does not preclude syrio from being a faceless man or being jaqen but it will not be jaqen wearing syrios face for simplicitys sake it will probably be syrio get the fuck over it
asoiaf,removed,i have a less serious theory that melisandre will feed someone with her ass its not as popular as this one with good reason it didnt have nearly the textual support
asoiaf,removed,i think you will love this
asoiaf,removed,dont stress when got is airing the shitposting is strong this community isnt always retarded
asoiaf,removed,i believe that it is not that silly you dont believe that a single chapter describing a character and to urinated large volumes and drowning not being kinslaying combined with a hated brother being named after a urine receptacle couldnt be plausible foreshadowing i got over positive upvotes in a few hours and multiple people saying that this does in fact seem very plausible i dont get why this was removed
asoiaf,removed,so me commenting on his comment history to draw a real logical argument of ethos is breaking rules of civility but him responding with lol ok buddy isnt disdainful enough to warrant his post being removed what kind of mental fucking gymnastics is that
asoiaf,removed,ît was removed just over twenty minutes ago for being silly in a forum where the theory that theon will grow a magical volcano dick and marry daenerys if allowed to stay this makes no sense to me this is not a joke theory its not even crackpot i laid out the textual evidence and its very convincing
asoiaf,removed,nobody eh 😏
asoiaf,removed,tbh tysha saw tyrion was nothing more than a meal ticket women dont fall in love with ugly dwarves
asoiaf,removed,calling someones contributions stupid and insulting someones intelligence are different things you are a fucking moron for not understanding that see the difference
asoiaf,removed,in addition lol ok buddy is rude dismissive and does not contribute to the discussion apply your sub rules equally or stop modding
asoiaf,removed,what is silly about this related because i just realized only i can see my original post on a reread of a feast for crows i noticed some odd parts regarding aeron damphair i put together a theory about what might be foreshadowed by these elements that i think is pretty strong we are told about aerons hatred of his brother euron but the ironborn take the prohibition on kinslaying pretty seriously especially godly men like aeron however there is a line where aeron comments on someone who killed a relative by drowning when told that he spilled the blood of his kin if he was drowned no blood was spilled if this implies that at least among the ironborn drowning someone is not considered kinslaying it might give aeron a way to kill euron that would be acceptable to him in this same chapter we are told about how aeron had an almost supernatural ability to urinate he would piss out hearth fires before he found religion and if youve ever tried to put out a goodsized campfire with a bucket of water youd know how impressive that is his urination abilities were so impressive that when he was captive at casterly rock people would come visit him in the gaol just to watch him piss if you google euron and disregard everything related to asoiaf youll see that it is the name of a brand of medical supplies what is the top item produced by euron urine receptacles you can surely see where im going with this i believe that it has been foreshadowed by grrm that aeron is going to drown euron with his urine i believe this would be a poetic way for aeron to kill him considering he was molested by euron and his role as a priest of the drowned god this would be the first person aeron drowned who did not survive it might also signal a return to his old life of drinking and having fun after giving up religion the recently released aeron chapter from the winds of winter adds more possible connections to this theory aeron is currently tied to a prow of a ship this will give him the opportunity to drink large amounts of seawater how does drinking seawater kill you it forces your kidneys to draw excessive water from your body to flush the salt out by drinking seawater aeron could both commit suicide in a godly way and produce perhaps the largest piss hes ever made this theory if true also offers some insight into grrms writing techniques it is my opinion that this scenario is one of the first scenes he imagined in the writing of the series why because theon is introduced in the first chapter and i do not believe its a coincidence that grrm named euron after a urine receptacle this is how i imagine his thought processes went he imagined a scene where an evil pirate is killed by being drowned in urine grrm is somehow aware of the euron brand of urine receptacles and thinks it would be a great joke to name this pirate after them but he does not want to give away his plans how to avoid this make euron a member of a family where their names all end with on then if someone asks him if he named euron after the urine receptacles he can claim ignorance of them and say he was just following the naming convention of his family balon victarion theon euron
asoiaf,removed,im reposting it here so more people can see that my post was not silly or off topic considering the textual support this seems logic and urine in a symbolic sense related to a drowning given by a priest who has invested sea water is not funny but symbolically meaningful on a reread of a feast for crows i noticed some odd parts regarding aeron damphair i put together a theory about what might be foreshadowed by these elements that i think is pretty strong we are told about aerons hatred of his brother euron but the ironborn take the prohibition on kinslaying pretty seriously especially godly men like aeron however there is a line where aeron comments on someone who killed a relative by drowning when told that he spilled the blood of his kin if he was drowned no blood was spilled if this implies that at least among the ironborn drowning someone is not considered kinslaying it might give aeron a way to kill euron that would be acceptable to him in this same chapter we are told about how aeron had an almost supernatural ability to urinate he would piss out hearth fires before he found religion and if youve ever tried to put out a goodsized campfire with a bucket of water youd know how impressive that is his urination abilities were so impressive that when he was captive at casterly rock people would come visit him in the gaol just to watch him piss if you google euron and disregard everything related to asoiaf youll see that it is the name of a brand of medical supplies what is the top item produced by euron urine receptacles you can surely see where im going with this i believe that it has been foreshadowed by grrm that aeron is going to drown euron with his urine i believe this would be a poetic way for aeron to kill him considering he was molested by euron and his role as a priest of the drowned god this would be the first person aeron drowned who did not survive it might also signal a return to his old life of drinking and having fun after giving up religion
asoiaf,removed,this is like the stannis fanboys going into denial last season
asoiaf,removed,ie people lacking a brain cell
asoiaf,removed,wouldnt be the first time religion justified a death
asoiaf,removed,finish it
asoiaf,removed,how can any intelligent person believe that stuff the church brainwashes them at the earliest possible age thats how
asoiaf,removed,riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,strawman much
asoiaf,removed,it was funny watching so many people being adamant about their ideas last season
asoiaf,removed,flaming its been years since ive heard anyone use the word flaming in description of gay people and it was always in a homophobic context every guy is hot wait you mean gay guys are attracted to other men holy shit yeah show loras isnt great but youre also a homophobe
asoiaf,removed,no its not an irrelevant technicality at all you think that having sex with a and having sex with a fertile and developed young lady are literally the same thing thats fucking ridiculous youre an absurd person and im glad i dont know you
asoiaf,removed,asha aint married ya dingus
asoiaf,removed,nope he did have most parts figured out but specifics were done in a long run for example i read that he didnt know that eyed crow would be bloodraven but that he will be of targaryen ancestry aegon iv and his bastards werent done by also
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,i bet your definition of many is not capable of being quantified such that taking you bet would something only an idiot would doill give you odds and take the bet
asoiaf,removed,maybe you should illustrate the way instead of just being a cunt
asoiaf,removed,i wish i had the time to address the glaring issues in your post but i dont so ill just let you know they are there and that i may or may not come back to explain them to you
asoiaf,removed,jon stole stannis plotline lollll so in the books stannis will retake the winterfell became the king in the north and then lead the northwestteros into the great war against the others huh calm down mannis fanboy lol and grrm himself confirmed that stannis along with mel will burn shireen so deal with it lol
asoiaf,removed,if you truly think stannis is going to lose to the boltons youre an idiot stannis is going to destroy them no hack hbo danyfag showrunners are gonna change that stannis is the greatest military commander in the seven kingdoms how could he get his ass kicked by an inexperienced stubborn idiot of a battle commander as hosteen frey also how would stannis burn shireen alive shes at castle black hundreds of miles away
asoiaf,removed,may i ask where you found that pdf
asoiaf,removed,i am agnostic so if i insulted christians or triggered fedorafags i am sorry what a disclaimer
asoiaf,removed,this alternative storyline sucks sorry op
asoiaf,removed,i heard that somewhere on the internet is a fan site for people that like jarjar binks and wish george lucas was still making decisions for the star wars universe whats wrong with you people when i am dictator i will insist that everyone agree with me
asoiaf,removed,homophobic slurs sigh wasnt used to demean homosexuals that should have been fairly obvious almost no one even uses it that way i didnt even use it by itself
asoiaf,removed,its pretty easy to understand why jon snow doesnt have the birthright dany has unless rhaegar and lyanna got married in which case he does have a better claim than dany
asoiaf,removed,aegon is irrelevant because he is fake stop being childish
asoiaf,removed,oh man that is so simplified he cant just change religions and have the realm back him especially not the southron lords or the common folk there is no way around rhaegar abandoning elia for lyanna marriage or not prophecy or not the reason robert would have killed jon isnt because his claim would be stronger its because it would have been in his mind the product of targaryen rape of his beloved lyanna i know thats a little off topic but some idiot keeps arguing against it with stupid points
asoiaf,removed,in future ill make sure never to express a disagreement of opinion for fear of being reported for being rude
asoiaf,removed,his death in the show was so disappointing sure he was a bad guy but he was just so chilling and interesting not just crzy sadistic like ramsay hope he doesnt go out like a bitch in the books
asoiaf,removed,i remember it specifically lists king tommen so at least asos
asoiaf,removed,i love the bits of lion on cerseis shoulder guard things and crown in the winds of winter and my favorite is sansas lannister wedding dress its probably my favorite costume in the series for the story it tells in the stitching honestly sansa gets the best costumes on the show
asoiaf,removed,i dont remember joffrey being under any influence of his uncles im not sure your point none tried jaime deliberately stayed distnat stannis was actually away renly mocks him and the first time we encounter tyrion and joffrey tywion is slapping his nephew and enjoys taunting his year old nephew that guy is not going to see margaery or her children or her appointees as something to just accept not when theyre what pushes cersei out of being queen im sorry you are suggesting the tyrells would give up the plan of their faction having huge influence over the realm because of the actions of a year old child actions that had not actually happened yet i guess it is going to be another one of those conversations were you ignore common sense the tyrells would not be basing their decision in trying to promote margaery as the next queen or full time mistress of robert baratheon based on the personality of his year old son robert is king that guy is not going to see margaery or her children or her appointees as something to just accept not when theyre what pushes cersei out of being queen robert is a relatively young man that is a problem that the tyrells could deal with in the next decade or so the tantrums of a year old boy are not usually regarded as set in stone and joffrey as king could push out the tyrell appointees yes eventually what renly was proposing is not something uncommon from real life medieval history factions in both french and english medieval history would vie to get support for their party through his libido they are thinking of the good it will do them in the present not that it will last till the end of time now i get that you cant understand this level of thinking but it existed and saying margaerys children with robert would be royal children anyway forgets that theyre in an eldest first system how does that stop them being royal even if margaery had any boys theyd be behind joffrey and tommen in the system who has claimed anything different theyd be loyal they would have royal blood and huge influence the only reason why the baratheons are in power is because a a baratheon son married a younger sibling of the heir it beggars belief that you are refusing to seen how advantageous this is maces grandchildren would be royalty and this all begs the unanswered question why not engage margaery to joffrey how do you know that was not an alternative we have no idea what the tyrells planned for their daughter of course once joffrey was betrothed to sansa that options was off the table dont tell me they couldnt do it they couldnt robert makes the marriage pact with the daughter of his best friend but for some reason the tyrells went along with renlys idea of her marrying the current king with far less guarantee of not running afoul the next king we have no idea what they agreed to margaery had never met the king never been to kings landing one plan a plan we hear of second hand does not mean that is their only option the only way that makes more sense would be if they either thought renly could convince the houses to accept cerseis children being set aside renly does not know not only do we see him acknowledging that joffey is the new king after roberts death we see him actually worry about his own life with cersei in charge if he knew the truth he would have revealed it instead we have quotes were he thinks it is no more than a clever story canon wise he does not know and are you suggesting that not only renly knows but the tyrells as well otherwise why would they accept renlys plan why has this secret not been made public with so many people knowing about it
asoiaf,removed,please just stop talking you got caught saying some dumb shit and everyone grilled you for it take the l and move on heres another life lesson that your mother obviously didnt teach you its not becoming of you to walk around and rudely verbally attack people who offer opinions that dont match your own its important to respect others opinions and they are as entitled to them as you are to yours and it is very possible to respectfully disagree with others instead of being an ignorant the one who said ignorant sexist shit is upset everyone called him out for saying ignorant sexist shit loool this stuff doesnt write itself
asoiaf,removed,i honestly expect to hear he has passed away before the book release announcement
asoiaf,removed,also from the same chapter stannis will need another hand observed aurane waters with a chuckle the turnip knight perhaps a turnip knight said ser harys swyft confused who is this man i have not heard of him waters did not reply except to roll his eyes i think the ironic part of ops quote though is that removing the head from the body was not quite mortal in that instance
asoiaf,removed,maketheironislandsgreatagian
asoiaf,removed,so since arya has a list that she prays over nightly do you think perhaps this is why she was chosen to serve kinda like the first fm making the second
asoiaf,removed,nowt to do with experiments and everything to do with jizz i imagine
asoiaf,removed,there is a reference to him in ariannes sample chapter or at least what appears to be hes pirating
asoiaf,removed,stealing cerseis fleet and going pirate to be aegons naval support
asoiaf,removed,as it has been stated previously on this subreddit we try to stay far away from anything really concerning the previous election
asoiaf,removed,you must be one of those people that think dany wears floppy ears arent you
asoiaf,removed,thats not emilias facebook page even description says emilia clarke fan pagemanaged by a fan seriously how dumb can you people be
asoiaf,removed,here we go again every year
asoiaf,removed,oh my fucking god let it die
asoiaf,removed,i think tommen dies cersei burns kinglanding jon snow is proclaimed king of the norf by the people bastard or nothes the prince that was promised jon snow king crowwildling saviourthe chosen onebest swordsman who ever walked in the norf
asoiaf,removed,on the other hand why does plot trump everything every time head on over to rwatchitfortheplot if youd like the answer
asoiaf,removed,i doubt it the show has taken the extremely boring position that favorite characters should assume the roles of less wellknown characters in the books this does actually give me hope that characters such as rickon will have a much more interesting story in the books and that he was killed in the show to tighten the cast and give more screen time to the established cast
asoiaf,removed,yeah thats show only boy besides that sandor was extremely hurt due to the tavern fight sandor in general is a better fighter than brienne
asoiaf,removed,i know what it means but op is talking about something the same fits in the scope of main if people in the comments want to talk about something more broad then they are free to use the comment spoiler tags its stupid to just tag every post as everything regardless of the topic
asoiaf,removed,occam razor your ass
asoiaf,removed,go and argue in the book pagei think they are talking here about the tv
asoiaf,removed,occar razor ahai my ass
asoiaf,removed,are you drunk i made no assumptions about terrain i made an assumption about speed which takes terrain into account im looking at how fast he is moving on the wide angle shot how fast his legs turn over how long his strides are he is taking decent strideshe is as tall as ramsay so he is taking adult sized strides at good turnover rate weak sauce kid are you posting these from class or did you skip school today
asoiaf,removed,yeah sansa knew she had the kov despite receiving no ravens back and despite the fact that she was talking suicide before the vale and if she knew she was going to win why sacrifice rickon your argument makes no sense
asoiaf,removed,so fucking dumb
asoiaf,removed,fubar too
asoiaf,removed,she said shes going home so i take her at her word maybe after a quick stop at the twins
asoiaf,removed,whoa that really helps boost an armys morale youre great at this lord commander thing you know that
asoiaf,removed,i can imagine next episode may have northern lords coming to winterfell to swear fealty to sansa it wouldnt be unreasonable for howland to show up and be like jon take a seat we need to talk
asoiaf,removed,i think we will get the tower of joy scene and see ned holding a baby then they will cut to jon becoming kingindanorf
asoiaf,removed,you seem to really like margaery i dont think this episode is going to be one you will like lol for the record i like her character and the actress is super hot she does well with the cards she is dealt but i dont see her as some female littlefinger or anything
asoiaf,removed,please lets post this idea more time maybe the millionth post might actually make it true
asoiaf,removed,more likely options dragons breath fire on jon it doesnt harm him or the dragons sense his identity and buddy up with him sam in wandering from his home toward oldtown stumbles upon the tower of joy and finds something there that proves jons identity this could either have always been there or it could be something bran plants through a green dream this either leads to jon getting dragonbreathed or sam shows up to reveal the fact sometime afterward some random but trustworthy person knows jons true identity and reveals it varys telling tyrion telling dany that she has a nephew for instance setting off the dance of dragons alternatively littlefinger may have found out or suspect the truth by through his business hunting down neds supposed whore who ned names and interrogating her discovering that ned hadnt been unfaithful but had paid off the woman the whore could even reveal that ned brought the baby from the tower of joy and littlefinger could piece it together from there littlefingers moves on sansa then have an added layer of complexity its not love of caitlyn but maintaining a closenesssense of protection over sansa because jon is alive and could eventually take the throne littlefingers betrayal of ned and murder of her sister already shows he doesnt really give a shit about caitlyn obviously bran sees it in a vision but nobodys going to believe bran
asoiaf,removed,i know how to make banners
asoiaf,removed,uh no shit
asoiaf,removed,i would put it the other way around sansa wasnt nearly attractive enough to deserve to have sex with ramsay
asoiaf,removed,give it a rest
asoiaf,removed,boo hoo
asoiaf,removed,i was wrong maybe the millionth and post will be the one that makes this true
asoiaf,removed,its a fuck up because you dont know all the details roflmao youre salty
asoiaf,removed,no you dont you dont send scouts out unless youre scouting for something lol what are you trying to clown me friend you send scouts out specifically to gather information on absolutely anything every single organized army constantly had scouts in the surrounding region have you ever read a book on warfare hed have to send our hundreds of scouts all over the northto look out for an army you dont even think is there what the fuck are you even talking about if sansa had told him that there is a possibility of a vale army approaching you send scouts in the general direction of where the vale army would logically come from from the vale on the way those scouts would talk to villagers or anyone traveling on the road whether they have seen anything unusual thats what scouts do your entire argument is pretty much lol no not a single rational thought went into your post you just say that scouts dont do what they are designed to do
asoiaf,removed,you think you know how war works its sad
asoiaf,removed,youve got issues
asoiaf,removed,you are suck a dip shit stop providing your opinion it is worthless some people have the capacity to understand good narrative totally works in television if you dont like that turn back to your sons of anarchy and transformers franchises and leave the adults to their conversations
asoiaf,removed,you only posted this comment times for it to be kind of meta youd need a few more about five i figure
asoiaf,removed,i torrent the episode every monday morning ive never watched a behind the episode
asoiaf,removed,anyone who thinks that any episode of breaking bad is even close to the better episodes of game of thrones is insane bad taste
asoiaf,removed,makes me wonder does the faith militant give a shit about the old god worshipping north men like will they try to go and convert them or something assuming the sept doesnt asplode
asoiaf,removed,have you not seen the spoilers lol
asoiaf,removed,no just being a little bitch
asoiaf,removed,isnt the point of the sub to accommodate many types of fans
asoiaf,removed,wow george being all sjwish and regressiveleftish not mentioning islam in the context of orlando massacre wasnt expecting thato
asoiaf,removed,splat
asoiaf,removed,wow george being all sjwish and regressiveleftish not mentioning islam in the context of orlando massacre wasnt expecting thato
asoiaf,removed,grow up
asoiaf,removed,martin said no lsh in the show the writers said no lsh in the show the shows current plot line says no lsh in the show you people are dense
asoiaf,removed,its not an insult its a fact this person is thick lsh is not coming yet they still they she is no matter how much evidence is presented they still think shes coming thats being dense no facts allowed on this sub
asoiaf,removed,for fucks sake what are you talking about what assumptions tyrion says theon insulted him in this manner theon does not deny it but even accepts it therefore it happened it really is that simple the fact that it didnt happen on the screen doesnt make it any less real jesus id never imagine this would be a point of contention
asoiaf,removed,riamverysmart
asoiaf,removed,you can stream it live it you like honesty i find it easier than anything else though it does require staying up till
asoiaf,removed,you could watch it in the morning on streaming sites i am from germany and i do the same
asoiaf,removed,an argumentative exchange in which one questions the other persons sanity can fairly be called a spat but if you want to argue that further i suggest you take it up over at rpedant or something
asoiaf,removed,this is not fair you are using leaked plot line as speculation this should be spoilers morally man
asoiaf,removed,its basically if obama feel for some fine ass italian chick who was betrothed to someone from germany and then we went to fight germany oops idk lol
asoiaf,removed,if we look at the shit the raiding wildlings have pulled in the past yeah it works pretty well i mean they could just be called isis all the raping murdering and pillaging you love to hate isis for but with extra cannibalism at least judging by what the northerners actually get to see from them anyway
asoiaf,removed,thousand word essay about ned raping lyanna goes poof
asoiaf,removed,sansa kills littlefinger in the godswood
asoiaf,removed,preston is a fool if he thinks a siege for jon and sansa was even remotely viable and they said they didnt add ghost because with both him and wun wun they didnt have a big enough budget it was one or the other and besides ghost would realistically get butchered in that fight
asoiaf,removed,i dont think thats a particularly worthwhile analogy the wildlings arent isis isis is a political grouping with a particular program that is well known its more like syrian war refugees and even that analogy is tortured than it is like isis
asoiaf,removed,i dont think thats a particularly worthwhile analogy the wildlings arent isis isis is a political grouping with a particular program that is well known its more like syrian war refugees and even that analogy is tortured than it is like isis
asoiaf,removed,could you contribute any less dont actually answer that im sure you could im also sorry my disdain for how the show treated dorne after season somehow impacted you
asoiaf,removed,epic arguing abilities fuck you no fuck you
asoiaf,removed,making season finale
asoiaf,removed,they were talking about literal dragons tho targaryen blood doesnt mean as much now especially in the north
asoiaf,removed,tower of joy part in episode of season is all but confirmed in the official soundtrack track the tower bonus track has not been in the show yet and you can practically hear promise me ned in the music so excited
asoiaf,removed,classic pinky in the butthole people never see it coming
asoiaf,removed,show tyrion is deep im not saying this as a book purist i say this as a general tv fan show tyrion while not written badly as such is far from deep he is a normal funny dwarf other than the family issues the reason people including i love him is dinks acting which hes been given no opportunities to showcase for the past one and half seasons his plot which peaked in seasons but is now nonexistent and absorbed by danys plot and his dialogue and interactions which are martins strong point but got lost from the show when they moved past him in seasons ending show tyrions appeal for me at least again im not trying to impact your enjoyment of the series i just think the word great has always been thrown around too much calling tyrion great is wrong great tv characters are characters like walter white jesse pinkman gus fring the man in black dr ford captain flint charles vane tbag frank castle crixus show tywin show cersei etc great is used for the very best characters characters who force emotions and thought out of you show tyrion is a lot of fun to root for and a lot of fun to see and hear and laugh for but he never gets you to tears or disturbs your daily routine youre very amazed by the plot surrounding him but never amazed by him
asoiaf,removed,tyrion grey if there is only one good guy in the books its him he is never cruel always understanding of people nice to almost everyone isnt quick to judge he has class and he is funny and smart there is a reason varys wants him to be an adviser to dany
asoiaf,removed,hillary clinton has built her entire career on betraying the people who support her most she lobbied for the crime bill and the welfare reform act which are largely responsible for the mass incarceration and poverty of black people today she voted for the patriot act which stripped away many of our constitutional rights she voted for the authorization for use of military force in iraq which has costed us trillions killed millions destabilized the entire middle east and only created vastly more terrorists than it ever killed she is george w bush with a d next to her name she is as incompetent as she is evil she is absolutely cersei
asoiaf,removed,yes but the brienne fight with the brave companions was amazing as well
asoiaf,removed,omggggggggg new alt shift x 💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦 so much better than that retard preston jacobs amirite
asoiaf,removed,an alliance of women want to invite a hundred thousand dothraki rapists to their continent
asoiaf,removed,only grrm specifically says theres no difference try again
asoiaf,removed,do you know anything about grrm other than asoiaf like anything at all he repeats himself constantly even reusing names for similar characters he explores the same types of themes over and over again before asoiaf he had never written and published a fantasy story he openly says that he doesnt believe there are real differences between fantasy and scifi hes openly critical of tolkeinesque cut and dry good vs evil high fantasy or wait the one ring couldnt be destroyed except at mount doom because it was super advanced alien alloy yeah grrm didnt write lotr sick false dichotomy though
asoiaf,removed,hes already reaching so hard he might as well change in name to monkey d luffy i love it
asoiaf,removed,burn the blasphemous heretic is against the policy noted
asoiaf,removed,littlefinger will make westeros great again
asoiaf,removed,youve never seen cheneys superpowers his iron glare was able to cow the american president for eight years his evil soulbaring voice was able to frighten the news media from questioning him directly his deadeye shooting prowess was the bane of any hunting buddy who thought he could beat him at checkers and then dare to walk beside him as they sought out their quarry blam no superpowers indeed
asoiaf,removed,i sometimes imagine myself as jon dribbling my seed into danys womb
asoiaf,removed,we will be left with the showgrrm has revealed the ending to d d twow and chapters from ados while grrm states that he does not use an outline he knows where he is taking the story second his writing style calls for writing in one pov for extended periods and the chapters assembled and edited to make one coherent volume this usually leaves surplus pov chapters that will be used in the next book based on previous books much of ados will be complete by time twow is released lastly we may be able to get the grrmarillion george elio and linda had far more material than they could use they decided to use a limit amount of the material and save the rest for future releases
asoiaf,removed,lol once again you cant answer a simple question it is ok to admit that sam physically beating the shit out of someone is worse than simply not showing up after saying you will
asoiaf,removed,youre a weird guy ever since i was a boy i dreamed of soaring over the battlefields as a dragon dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting dothraki people say to me that a person being a dragon is impossible and im fucking retarded but i dont care im beautiful im having a plastic surgeon install leathery wings scales and giant claws on my body from now on i want you guys to call me viserion and respect my right to be killed and resurrected by the night king if you cant accept me youre a dracophobe and need to check your privilege thank you for being so understanding
asoiaf,removed,you dont get what im talking about clearly
asoiaf,removed,george pls finish twow ಥಥ
asoiaf,removed,im saving this comment so i can remember to pull citations layers but off the top of my head queen mab murphy thomass sister in the white court and their de facto leader literally offers him an alliance based on sex his apprentice most of the above also are repeats butcher just cant seem to have a major female character that doesnt want to fuck harry and im only citing major characters bring in the flirty side characters like maeve and it just gets ridiculous i didnt say butcher wasnt enjoyable i said i liked his heist novel but acting like hes a writer whos contributed to the genre more heavily than martin is factually absurd martins won more awards his anthologies are classics and hes built the reputation of dozens of major writers in their infancy with collaborations i suggest you reread my point about how butcher writes gay characters he doesnt at all he writes bad stereotypes and no homo bro jokes im baffled how you dont see him as mary sue hes literally a basement dwelling metaphorical neckbeard that butcher takes pains to write internal monologue that you could simulate subreddditsimulator for mlady think about everytime he suddenly levels up or overcomes fatal injuries because a womans in trouble or his mental anguish self monologue whenever he tries to focus on a woman and you wouldnt be able to tell the difference oh id love to see an equivalent list for asoiaf please be my guest its easy right i didnt charge out of my way you came across like a smug asshole ripped all over people and then got pissed when someone said your suggestion was the big mac of urban fantasy
asoiaf,removed,woah did you just assume their sexual preferences
asoiaf,removed,oh yeah he aint got no chill love it cant wait to see more of him in twow ha
asoiaf,removed,but isnt a broken man a woman
asoiaf,removed,man we constantly see that kevan would be such a great ruler hes could do so well with tommen and bring the lanister name out of the dirt and back on top where it belongs damn the spider and damn his little birds
asoiaf,removed,did you honestly just spoil that for me
asoiaf,removed,showkevan is now dead too right in the sept
asoiaf,removed,the scene in question happens in the epilogue for adwd
asoiaf,removed,kevans death sucked but it did work as sort of a heel turn for varys which they tossed out on the show by making it scummy qyburn
asoiaf,removed,what was she talking about
asoiaf,removed,hi i had to remove your comment as it discusses adwd material in a spoilers affc thread please edit your comment accordingly probably just remove the last sentence and let me know or send a modmail and ill reapprove it thanks
asoiaf,removed,sounds like some good traits that will get him killed
asoiaf,removed,this question varies greatly on whether were talking about the show or books show he might not hate jaime at all theres no tysha problem but is in a lot of danger from jaime remember the scene with bronn on the boat but on the show his love for dany is tangible and strong really tough call books he hates jaime for tysha yet his relationship with danaerys is insubstantial and largely not of his choosing one could argue that hes more on aegons side than hers he even finds himself surprised at caring so much when he hears about aegon invading i cant chose either way but damn its wild how different the issue is depending on the source
asoiaf,removed,fuck you
asoiaf,removed,not completely the show still hasnt caught up to sams story from the books
asoiaf,removed,i hate to do this because i am mostly going to insult you without argument or anything but this sub is so fucking stupid so times and i need to get this off my chest stop pretending that just because you want to be different a dont want the typical couple to be the typical couple this thing doesnt make sense or grrm wouldnt do it dany is not a supervillian get fucking over it she is a good character and she is not fucking crazy you are deluding yourselves and you know it jon is not the best most original character to ever be created he is the classical bastard king and yes he is a good character and i like him very much but he is also flawed and it doesnt make sense that everyone thinks dany is a fucking cruel bitch while jon is practically jesus last grrm writes tons a tons of troops but he makes them feel real and gives them little twist so they dont come off as ridiculous and has enough surprises to make the story interesting but he writes lots and lots of common stuff for fucks sake people get your head out of your ass
asoiaf,removed,im pretty sure that the writing process for the show is now just dd compiling a list of all the possible big moments choosing the ones they like and contriving a narrative that fits all of those big moments in examples they like the frey pie notion from the books so they need to steal it somehow unfortunately theyve pretty much cut manderly and theyve already shown that arya doesnt like killing innocent people who dont deserve it which is why she flunked out of faceless school so they make her do a complete and kill some poor random girl and take her face just so that she can bake walder freys kids into a pie for some reason rather than just sneaking up and killing him they also decide that doran martell plotting the downfall of the lannisters for years while externally seeming nice and amiable isnt cool enough so they kill him in some weird gurl power moment but fuuuuuuuck what about fire and blood eh well just give it to ellaria and give varys as the reason
asoiaf,removed,are you a troll account or just a retard
asoiaf,removed,i love the rain
asoiaf,removed,pain lagidamit joffery tyrian lagitimize well you tried im also sure the one with the hammer was gendry pod would make you sense
asoiaf,removed,dark ages dark ages dark ages dark ages do something mother fucker dark ages sorry couldnt help it
asoiaf,removed,dany is aware of all jon has been through before they meet she knows hes been resurrected as she has they mutually respect each other for their victories and triumphds resurrection i should be a writer on the show honestly
asoiaf,removed,and the plot for the most part was top notch oh my sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,marry littlefinger for the spousal contribution although considering littlefinger was just borrowing all his money from the jews iron bank his stewardship might not be that great either pity the bank is so much harder to expel
asoiaf,removed,can other people see this jews in this context refers specifically to the money lending mechanism of the game being referenced furthermore do other religious groupsethnicities have hatespeech triggers on here seems a bit much considering all the real world analogies in asoiaf
asoiaf,removed,many people are actually forgetting about arya ther could be some serious plot twist when gendrys real identity is revealed daenerys is not a friend of house baratheon and arya wont support someone who wants to kill gendry even if jon supports her
asoiaf,removed,we can have more than one party did you see the leaks there will be a handshake get your hypemeter to over and come up with some ideas
asoiaf,removed,yup the fat goon author insert will get recognition this is true
asoiaf,removed,and as he was floating around in the here and now then and there his eyes caught a glimpse of meera bathing in the subterranean lake her breast shivering in darkness and he felt a sensation out of this consciousness he got violently pulled out of the tree he couldnt remember much but saw he needed to clean his cloths one of the crows had taken a shit on his crotch
asoiaf,removed,i think theres a chance dragons will just escalate the whole thing into a bigger war than it already appears to be maybe one of daeneryss dragons will somehow get captured by the night king and be turned into an undead dragon then shit will get crazy
asoiaf,removed,i think we saw a glimpse of that on the show wherein jon becomes much more melancholic quiet and brooding as another character describes him i imagined how thatd be when grrm makes jon a really dark and sad character and writes from his povs hes died and hes come back even death couldnt give the man rest a part of him wants rest but another part of him knows that there is a great evil coming itll be good i hope
asoiaf,removed,not at all bran shows his risky wild side in his willingness to climb around on winterfells walls and the way he behaves inside summer remember that most of the time he cant even walk
asoiaf,removed,bran consistently shows desire to do the right thing but he also consistently does things he knows are wrong such as spying on jaimecersei or going inside hodor which is probably morally worse than anything brandon ever did
asoiaf,removed,obviously shes still alive shes hiding in the crypts to guide jon snow in his fight against the wights once he becomes kingindanorf
asoiaf,removed,i agree that brandon is the more outwardly brashimpulsive and additionally that we see this behavior in rickon although i feel he leaves so soon we dont really know much about him i was more pointing out the tendency of starks to do things that are definitely more on the risktaking than the riskaverse side of things bran is clearly a thinker i would have to go back and read through his chapters to get a better sense of it for instance how much can we characterize the climbing on walls and spying on people as impulsive i imagine a reread might contain some textual clues alas i dont have my books here i feel its difficult to make a to comparison between bran and brandon because one is a healthy man and the other a crippled boy certainly by being crippled it likely forces brandon to be more introspective and to think through how he will achieve his goals at the same time he uses the ability of warging to escape his body and taste the freedom and wildness he cant get any other way
asoiaf,removed,no jon and daenaerys is neiceaunt not cousincousin a better example would be tywin and his wife joanna who were first cousins
asoiaf,removed,hand shaq grand maester ben carson master of coin donald trump master of whispers putin master of ships donald trump master of laws donny the trumpanator lord commander of the kingsguard pepe
asoiaf,removed,hi just a reminder this is a no spoilers thread so please add spoiler tags to your comment and i will approve it thanks example of spoiler code usage s your spoilers here please make sure the quotes are regular quotes and not fancy quotes
asoiaf,removed,neds also one of the least reliable narrators of the story just think in the dungeons of the red keep it could have been the thought of jon filled him with a sorrow too deep for words if only he could sit and talk with the boy and tell him he was not his son but the son of his sister and the heir to the throne
asoiaf,removed,honestly the house of stark is pretty conveniently tiny and underdeveloped i consider it personally a plot hole in the series there are lannister cousins and second cousins and relations and brothers and uncles bursting out of every closet in casterly rock and kings landing but once you kill ned stark and vanish benjen apparently that accounts for every single extant ofage male stark no cousins no uncles no living grandparents no second cousins no maiden aunts no cadet branches except for the apparently very distant karstarks part of the strength of the lannisters at least early on is that theyre surrounded with rich conspirators that theyre related to the reason the starks fall so relatively easily is that they literally have nobody to look after the north if ned leaves or robb goes on the warpath they should have dozens of fairly close relations but they have nobody same goes for the baratheons—convenient lack of close living relations and heirs pretty easy to exterminate the line lack of relatives really stacks the deck against you its like none of these guys ever played crusader kings
asoiaf,removed,the us just elected a year old president and the other candidate was
asoiaf,removed,howdy youve marked this as spoilers main but the stuff you bring up from the leaks is only covered under spoilers production or infinite if you edit those tidbits out i can reapprove this post thank you
asoiaf,removed,hi you have httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikispoilertagsystem in your post the mention of the ice dragon needs to be completely deleted because theres an infinite unconfirmed but definitely quarantined spoiler in regards to it and here the fire mount and treason related to jon didnt happen yet this actually shows that as in the leaks jon will be the mount ridden to love she will love him remove the as in the leaks because that again is a production level spoiler and even putting production tags on it tells people that theres some kind of confirmation for your theory in the leaks let me know once you edit your post and ill reapprove it alternately if you want to keep as in the leaks you can repost with spoilers production just remember to definitely remove the ice dragon
asoiaf,removed,theres going to be some interaction between the characters thats some fantastic predictin there lou
asoiaf,removed,i think they mean that its foreshadowing littlefingers involvement in poisoning joffrey
asoiaf,removed,youre reaching for straws in order to justify yourself
asoiaf,removed,people believe in dinosaurs even though they lived millions of years ago fossil evidence supports it a disturbingly large portion of the us doesnt believe dinosaurs were real though at best they really truly believe that dinosaurs and humans coexisted because the earth is only years old those are the people who just elected trump
asoiaf,removed,offs grrm pls
asoiaf,removed,excellent catch the other small insertion is grrms reminder that he left the hint asos tyrion pycelle says when i was a boy at the citadel my teachers named it simply the strangler almost the exact same wordscoincidence i doubt it i would not be surprised if we find out later that the two cressen and pycelle were taught citadel at the same time by the same people it does not matter now since both are dead
asoiaf,removed,i would have trump as my master of coin cause love him of hate him he can make some money
asoiaf,removed,not really keep stretching brohirram
asoiaf,removed,not gonna lie im a little worried that after the election hes gonna ragechange major plot points to be trump metaphors
asoiaf,removed,maybe if you cry about it more hell just say fuck it and publish the book as is because apparently without you hes nothing
asoiaf,removed,youre now censoring people for saying the other name of the wildlings wow
asoiaf,removed,it is so the mods have an excuse to just take the ability for people to have a free discussion away it is just the latest petty power grab
asoiaf,removed,donald trump as jon snow hilary clinton as lysa
asoiaf,removed,this maester thinks you may be a bit of a self obsessed ass
asoiaf,removed,catelyn this is hoster tullys funeral
asoiaf,removed,thats lord hoster being sent off to his watery grave at riverrun with cat the blackfish and lord edmure who is holding the bow
asoiaf,removed,kinda like obama kinda like nixon mostly like hilary clinton a confusing man
asoiaf,removed,getting over one of the famous con crud sicknesses that go around at big conventions like that i keep hearing about that but i gotta call shenanigans by that logic everybody who works in a mall or an airport or who goes to a football match or a concert would be getting sick you cant just say that every time you stick a couple of thousand people in a room together illness will abound far more likely that the disgusting specimens at scifi conventions are themselves the culprits their personal hygiene and immune systems having declined from years of solitary nerding in their mothers basement he says pausing a moment to scrape the chip crumbs from his neckbeard onto the floor of his own mothers basement or is con crud a euphemism for a fresh batch of genital warts
asoiaf,removed,you cant really tell wat is happening if you didnt readed the book and you just spoiled the lords fate
asoiaf,removed,you sound like such an insecure douche in every comment in this thread
asoiaf,removed,rgameofthrones is thataway
asoiaf,removed,nice autism
asoiaf,removed,call me crazy but i bet if trump wins grrm will be pissed and be like why should i release this book to a country full of idiots that voted him in not saying i hold those views but grrm definitely does and i think hes holding off until the elections to decide if he will actually release this book
asoiaf,removed,not sure how this is relevant but thanks for the negativity
asoiaf,removed,aww bless you still think well get another book in the main series
asoiaf,removed,im not sure about the gravedigger theory are you serious the gravedigger theory is as obvious as it gets youd have to be delusional to think that the gravedigger isnt sandor
asoiaf,removed,with the season spoilers in mind its safe to say this theory as well as the tyrion dragon rider theory is dead as they both should be both theories are just readers loving a character so much they project more importance onto them than grrm intended both of these theories are retarded
asoiaf,removed,nobody loves you
asoiaf,removed,also what the heck was this scene copying an old comment of mine that scene had lots of points showing tyrions work to bring peace showing varys vulnerability showing the powermagic of the red priestess paralleling cersei back in westeros and her interactions with the faith giving us more insight into the red faith and perhaps most importantly reinforcing the idea that dany is the chosen one the prince what were promised or azor eeyor or whatever as well as tying that prophesied hero with the one that mel has been searching for also we might be seeing kinvara return in i think i read something along those lines a week or so ago cant be bothered to go through all the wotw articles to confirm though as for varys im content that show varys isnt that complex that he is looking to do the best for the realm that what he said to tyrion in was close to the truth robert was a disaster he wanted to return the targs to the throne as the targs are the only ones who could hold the whole kingdoms together
asoiaf,removed,vote for me lets make rasoiaf great again
asoiaf,removed,i was agreeing to be honest i didnt read the entire bullshit troll post but was backing you up
asoiaf,removed,spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers i actually saw on one of the leaked videos of season that he is in some fight with a warhammer just like his daddy robby
asoiaf,removed,stopped reading during the bullshit about daenerys becoming queen if the others were all gonna be in mental wards if twow isnt here soon
asoiaf,removed,this is so stupid
asoiaf,removed,youre right this isnt foil its too stupid to be the entire post is ridiculous your connections dont actually connect and all your speculating is downright random go back to your reread of the series and leave the theories to the big kids
asoiaf,removed,nobody bothered to answer you anyhow kiddo lmao
asoiaf,removed,god the way the guy talks is so fucking annoying
asoiaf,removed,i stopped following the production news because i read a post saying arya reunited with nymeria
asoiaf,removed,oh god its you every time theres a conversation about jons abilities its out with the same lord snow doesnt want to fight real knights arguments enough everyone calls bullshit every time just leave it
asoiaf,removed,theyre great for when used as background noise playing video games i get to relive robb getting shanked during most games downtimes
asoiaf,removed,there was no hot sex scenes with sophie turner i was disappointed
asoiaf,removed,shut up
asoiaf,removed,well catherine the great queen of russia used to have sex with horses among other unspeakable perversions so there is historical precedence
asoiaf,removed,maybe the moon tea is for marg but because she is sneaking into tommens room at night
asoiaf,removed,well the quarter of last year someone posted the synopsis for the whole season and a lot of it was wrong got brans visions all wrong no hold the door said daario was the harpy and made himself king of meereen got a lot of meereen wrong got the north wrong said sansa and jon made it to the last hearth where rickon was where the umbers crown sansa queen in the north said the season ended with euron sounding the horn the sound heard round the world and the wall coming down i forget a lot of it but it was almost entirely wrong the only thing i remember being right was that sam stole heartsbane from his dad
asoiaf,removed,give me an evidence preferably a video high quality please pulls his dick out and waits
asoiaf,removed,you sound upset
asoiaf,removed,keep telling yourself you need to read the books first to pick up on basic foreshadowing in a story as if none of those lines make sense without context to a source material i hope you realize how ridiculous and stupid that sounds
asoiaf,removed,if it didnt crash when trump was winning the presidency its not crashing for anything anymore
asoiaf,removed,correct me if im wrong uechtrae does just this op nah you dumb bro
asoiaf,removed,lyanna is mentioned in a few episodes not exactly repeatedly it isnt revealed they were in love some guy just claims they were as if nobody ever claimed anything in this show that wasnt true one character even says its not like ned to father a bastard one character who didnt really know ned one character who believes he is azor ahai reborn one character who burns people alive because some fiery tart tells him burns people alive including his own daughter its so obvious thanks for illuminating how obvious this foreshadowing was you are totally right you must be one of those geniuses
asoiaf,removed,see above
asoiaf,removed,my sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,stop posting here
asoiaf,removed,im sure he still enjoys writing he just knows this is his grand opus and is taking his time to get it right in years it will likely be a classic like the lotr while the show will have aged out of popular culture his immortality hinges on the quality of these last two books
asoiaf,removed,so unbelievably selfish what a hateful childish attitude for a grownass man to have the fans have made him rich and he cant even let them have the conclusion to a story theyve invested years in what a dick
asoiaf,removed,doesnt matter how rich you are money wont help clogged arteries
asoiaf,removed,the show spoils the books go away
asoiaf,removed,ive been saying this for a while not being pessimistic just realistic hes not exactly a shining beacon of health there is a reason the expression there are old men and fat men but not many old fat men exists
asoiaf,removed,wow sad that the mods censored the conversation about overweight people dying early
asoiaf,removed,he makes the best deals he also has the best words
asoiaf,removed,no the fat man will never finish the series
asoiaf,removed,oh he makes terrific deals the best deals believe me hell make the north start winning again the wall just got ten feet higher
asoiaf,removed,a clinton always pays their debts
asoiaf,removed,the mad candidate trump thinks he can force his way past us to the presidency without trouble but here we stand
asoiaf,removed,even my post decrying the mods for censoring discussion over health issue that cannot be named was deleted heavy moderation is the slow death
asoiaf,removed,trump snow making the best deals we have the best wildlings dont we folks
asoiaf,removed,i will upvote anything that mocks that orange buffoon
asoiaf,removed,jon makes the best deals believe me the ice wall such a great wall by the way keeps those pesky free folk savages north we dont want them they are murderers rapists and i assume some are good people but they are dangerous folks our leaders make terrible deals jon doesnt jonforlordcommander
asoiaf,removed,rsneakybackroundfeet
asoiaf,removed,rsneakybackroundfeet
asoiaf,removed,the king renly baratheon contrary to the unsupported claims of so many people on this sub and various asoiaf forums renly is set up to be a very effective king for his political era we know as early as agot that he is scheming to replace cersei with marg when his only tyrrell contact would be loras hes never mentioned to be lavish in anything but dress and is against the ruinous spending of robert he is also a most importantly hes able to charm nobles and smooth out the rough edges this is the most important quality for a king to have in this stage of politics arguably assuming that renly absorbed the crownlands into the stormlands unlikely to be fair he could at best raise slightly more men than one of his lord paramount bannermen and any two could out raise him its also important to remember that renly can be ruthless when called upon he was one of the earliest proponents of assassinating the remaining targs dany and viserys hand of the king tywin lannister arguably the most successful kings hand that the seven kingdoms have ever had he is highly respected by nearly every lord in the realm even if hes not necessarily liked he would also take anything less as a slight upon his person and thus would make him an enemy of the king the lord commander of the kingsguard jaime lannister post hand cutting while there are many more accomplished swordsmen than jaime after he loses his hand he becomes a much more accomplished politican and general after he loses his hand he becomes far more introspective and becomes more of a thinker than previously if i wanted to avoid a second lannister on my council i would probably go for randyll tarly if i could pick from anyone or if i had to choose from within the kingsguard then i would pick gerold hightower the master of laws ned starkrobb starkstannis depending on what were allowed to pick from i would pick from among these three all three have an almost unbending sense of justice this position would let them mainly have the benefits of that iron sense of law but without the drawbacks of needing to be political for the most part which is an area all three are literally the worst in the master of coin littlefinger i really dont see anyone who could even come close to baelish hes basically inventing the earlymodern era ideas of finance in affc and seems to be based on some of the councilors of henry vii who used finance to keep the power of the nobles down the master of ships corlys velaryon not only is the sea snake a great naval commander in battle he is also an experience trader this is an area that i feel that every other noble is lacking in and that his experience in this position could help enrich the seven kingdoms the master of whispers varys again the super easy pick hes just a league ahead of all of his rivals in this area his major downfall for the pick is that his loyalties obviously lie elsewhere the grand maester aemon targaryen an incredibly wise man who lived through more history than any man living he also seems to do an incredible job shepherding both jon and sam the high septon doesnt really matter as long as hes loyal and doesnt stir the pot keep the gods to yourselves lads two small council advisors of your choosing any two lords who i felt i needed to befriend or who needed to be kept close
asoiaf,removed,minutes the absolute mad man
asoiaf,removed,k
asoiaf,removed,just because neil gaiman says something doesnt make him right the blame lies squarely with grrm he admits it himself grrm dedicates his time with travelling and wild cards for the last years and then lies through his teeth saying he is writing as fast as he can then he feels sorry for himself because hbo have the temerity to make a show on schedule with plot points he sold them read all the procrastination and self pity here
asoiaf,removed,except i have gave several examples of people making their own decisions in direct relation to leaving their home and running with someone else you ignore all of that of course i ignored it the author is pretty clear the age when someone is considered an adult if lyannas family considered it abduction and rape then it was so in their society rhaegar kidnapped and raped the year old lyanna whether she consented or not downvoting me is not going to change that but you are welcome try
asoiaf,removed,did robert get off on being strangled
asoiaf,removed,id say that the majority of younger americans heh see even you cant help yourself i dont think many if any americans think of a wasp when they think american citizen not any more but you still think white and its still true because otherwise trump having very low to virtually no support amongst women and minorities would mean hed have no chance yet hes still pretty close to hildog in with mostly white men
asoiaf,removed,so perhaps the others have sexual needs and thus satisfy themselves with sheep so basically ww are welsh
asoiaf,removed,no one got verification that serio got killed by meryn trant grrm could have resolved the matter by having meryn utter something about the matter during the past books he must a reason to keep us hanging
asoiaf,removed,isnt there speculation that he is a faceless man
asoiaf,removed,i know honestly even though i love the other suggestions but her vale chapters as alayne are really the first time shes been happy and safe since her early agot chapters her recovery back into sassy sansa made me so glad
asoiaf,removed,what a pointless passiveaggressive post you think rhaegar was a coward good for you you dont actually know but good for you
asoiaf,removed,baseless he easily coukd have gotten arrested instead of killed thrown in black cells and became jaqen not likely but plausible whose word do we have that syrio was really sword of braavos neds laughable
asoiaf,removed,how high are you right now
asoiaf,removed,can we please get a medivac helicopter to follow grrm around i just know hes going to try and croak before he finishes
asoiaf,removed,im trying to be helpful and kind do you know when stannis stopped following hint the targs were still in power this stannis fangirl is merely trying to suggest that the socalled hypocrisy goes against grrms canon i guess you can make up your own thoughts and not take friendly correction but honestly id put it on some fanfiction site instead of trying to present fanfiction that as hypocrisy in any way what next sansa was a hypocrite for marrying tyrion and littlefinger yes its that bad stannis didnt turn on any rightful king until years and years after he dropped in fact he dropped the and remained loyal to king aerys though it was king aerys mission that got his dad killed and thats why stannis dropped the its a huge story and gives stannis some great dimension you dont have to like him but dont misconstrue it so bad you can slam his atheism all you want or his hair i dont care but try to get it right or its not a discussion its random words or something again trying to be helpful
asoiaf,removed,were gonna build another wall and the wildlings are going to pay for it
asoiaf,removed,hes going to croak before he finishes it
asoiaf,removed,i guess people out there still care for all its faults the show is tying things up adequately and it isnt going to cost me a decade of my life hoping the fat guy doesnt succumb to his lifestyle before he finishes his lifes work
asoiaf,removed,incorrect davos flies in the face of this if his entire morality was based on the law he should have killed him even if he did save his life but he allows mel to burn his soldiers caught in the act of cannibalism relatives who betrayed him enemies etc ftfy aka people who he would have killed anyway again this is because he doesnt abide solely by the law he knows that jon can do more good for the realm in winterfell than rotting in castle black what good are vows when innocent lives are at stake you aware of the concept of a king right everything stannis did was extremely kinglike you seem to be conflating kinglike with bending the knee to jon after saving the wall kings give orders their subjects obey he is unlikable because he is just and keeps his army in line unpledged knights and soldiers dont like to fight as much when there isnt the offer of a farm to loot or young girl to rape at the end of the tunnel werent those the kings landing brothels the brothels that were funding littlefinger and his schemes im not saying stannis new about all of littlefingers schemes but he clearly had no love for the man and did not trust him rightly so it could have been an attempt to weaken littlefinger then again he also could have been a dick about it right by conquest is the oldest right of them all thats where the targaryen throne comes from they usurped by not claiming the throne through blood through family or soldiers the baby is an abomination if i remember correctly he never actually says anything about the baby itself just gilly if you have the quote feel free to prove me wrong you kind of left out the part where he tried to assassinate one of his advisers again he spared davos from what should have been an execution by denying stannis claim the one true claim you are allowing the fabric of the realm succession laws of the royal families to be unwound and drive the realm to chaos with your laziness greed thirst for power or complacency i dont blame him not much to go off of here since its based on all your other false presumptions also u mad
asoiaf,removed,id like to know why you think ucarpejvgvlvm is delusional calling someone delusional without backing it up is not a very chivalrous thing to do

asoiaf,removed,gay sex gay sex gay sex im not afainst faggots but got obsession with gay sex was really weird after seeing that it never happened in the books
asoiaf,removed,yeah but its definitely more than coincidence that the african countries right beside asia and europe were considerably more advanced than everywhere else
asoiaf,removed,why should anyone listen or care if you go on a not as good as the books rant
asoiaf,removed,why the fuck should anyone listen to your rants
asoiaf,removed,well that is because of the damn cersei implications also i swear they make it more potent for her than it is for anyone else in the mod or the vanilla version i have had attractive strong lusty geniuses who never cheated on me but maergry she fucking cheated on robb added strong and attractive to him with fucking syrio in the end old ned stark had to dish out some northern justice that earned him the tyrant trait though
asoiaf,removed,okay no one dare mention anything about weddings or the colors red or purple
asoiaf,removed,believe me bro ive been disgusted with the fuckery dd have been shoveling towards us to make room for casuals since the beginning but i will occasionally appreciate something worth appreciating i know hardhome never happened but i dont mind because it was well done that shit was chilling as fuck pun intended especially the big walker fuck you at the end the battle wasnt just well done it was beautifully done i just wish they put that much effort towards actually recreating the fucking story instead of ruining yes they fucking have ruined so much the narrative its irritating everytime they do something mindbogglingly retarded they add during the commentary that it was all georges idea what bullshit that always comes out to be
asoiaf,removed,is this what this sub has come to questions about grain storage royal finances have all the good questions been asked
asoiaf,removed,there is no evidence the only thing we know is he ended up starting a war and betraying his family and abandoning his wife to either go fuck an engaged woman or for a prophecy he cost thousands their lives who had nothing to do with his obsession and may have even kidnapped and raped lyanna to do it its convenient how you rhaegar apologists always conveniently forget about his wife and children he betrayed and all the innocents he got caught up in his bullshit
asoiaf,removed,he made winterfell great again

asoiaf,removed,this is the number one shit list of all time on this sub i cant believe you people are giving this upboats yes grrm wrote the meager rhaegar parts in the book with a focus on bipolar disorder you fucking loons
asoiaf,removed,or the easier explanation is that he wasnt quite the heroic person that everyone loved how many people knew him first hand how many people in the series do we know have reputations as good people who are actually complete utter cunts
asoiaf,removed,your bit about destabilizing westeros made me realize how similar mopatis is to george soros the dothraki are his migrants
asoiaf,removed,what a load of old baloney this is a shitpost at its finest
asoiaf,removed,so sorry but posts like this should be banned its like if i were to make a post contemplating whether rhaegar prefers to wipe his own ass or use a duvet its fucking pointless
asoiaf,removed,til tumblr has discovered this subreddit
asoiaf,removed,so what i found at least typos it probably depends on the edition you are reading nothing special
asoiaf,removed,yes they do cunt
asoiaf,removed,so a scar not aids and financial ruin
asoiaf,removed,you know i think i thought the same thing that retarded helper dude who was nice but stupid and evil —he and his family had nothing on tuco or any of the other walt competitors the final seasons felt a bit politically correct suggesting that the real baddies were rednecks while through most of the series walts competition were mexican drug lords or people who made sense which rang true because of the location also i hated fucking skylar what was that shit making her the victim like her brain fell out of her head for a year or two bitch enjoyed the shit out of that money once she had her poor me imma drown episode but if i ignore the reviews and bullshit i can see the gray areas where skylar and walt and jesse were pretty equally gray why critics thought methhead jesse was like a total victim is beyond me and i liked jesse and thought walt helped him out with jane and in the finale and walt beating the system was bangup awesome until he and hank and everyone were bested by the sudden real evil of the universe some stupid rednecks how you make this here blue meffamfetterman git to it bud ugh its hard to rewatch even
asoiaf,removed,once we were conquerors and we dont win anymore are the exact same idea isnt trumps comment about being able to shoot people on fifth avenue and still get votes exactly the kind of thing euron would say about his small and noisy folk
asoiaf,removed,httpasotafcom
asoiaf,removed,here was jon a bastard and a deserter seemingly making a power play for the north after you just lost sons family and friends to a war that was never yours what would you do would you kneel and sacrifice everything for a man who was bringing your sworn enemy onto your back yard with little proof a modern equivalent would be like bill clintons bastard kid coming from iraq after destroying isis and bringing the taliban and plopping them in connecticut and new jersey then asking you to march on donald trump at nyc he comes and says the real threat isnt trump it isnt democrats or republicans it isnt even the power plays or corruption from down in washington in reality its actually canadian albinos super soldiers created by native americans with an army of wooly mammoths and sabertooth tigers that havent been seen in years thats even before you realize some angry white girl from bush senior basically united all the masses from africa and china because she hatched not one but three tyrannosaurus you would be hard pressed to believe it right you know all those creatures were alive at one time but somehow died off thats why the north didnt back jon they were tired of being caught between everyone elses games sticking with a cruel regime is easier then dealing with an uncertain idealist who could make everything infinitely worse
asoiaf,removed,linda is this you
asoiaf,removed,i read this as many writers are coming and going george plz dont die boi
asoiaf,removed,eurontrump is my new favourite thing but now its making me appreciate trump as a super villain lets hold out until he tries to summon some ancient monstrosity to help him conquer america
asoiaf,removed,leak everything his publishers have then i just need a little fix man
asoiaf,removed,hell rewrite the first as well so all his mental theories come true

asoiaf,removed,twow is coming oh you sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,i does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live donald trump
asoiaf,removed,kids
asoiaf,removed,
asoiaf,removed,twow and he was so blown away by jons resurrection he literally couldnt even
asoiaf,removed,you had to say that the day before the american elections
asoiaf,removed,george is just another fat cat hollywood type now made lazy by his success decrying donald trump while hillary rapes our democracy what a shame
asoiaf,removed,the trump in the north
asoiaf,removed,well if what some leaks are saying is true im pretty sure i know
asoiaf,removed,nah its just him doing overtime work for hillary clinton he even admits he is ultra anxious about it and might get suicidal in case she loses once today has passed he will resume his life like everyone else id be surprised if we get a manuscript finished before junenext season starts
asoiaf,removed,drogon will die north of the wall be resurrected and kill dany
asoiaf,removed,uncontrollable vomit intensifies
asoiaf,removed,showeuron trump largely came out of nowhere wins people over with huge impossible building projects makes crude jokes about sex and his big cogg cersei hilary part of what you could call the establishment people associated with her housefoundation mysteriously tend to die in large wildfire explosions rooted for by normies tfw you cant hate everyone who says things like yasssss queen to death with your mind theon jeb bush expected to win instead his campaign for becoming king of the iron islandspresident failed miserably will be the subject of ridicule for the rest of his life
asoiaf,removed,poor quentyn is great isnt he too bad big walder wasnt a republican candidate or hed have removed trump but yeh trump is so euron even down to being a massive sex offender emmett did compare hillary to rodrik at one point mayhaps asha
asoiaf,removed,i think poor quentyn said of trump hes cersei and victarions son kidnapped and raised by euron he also has this
asoiaf,removed,trump is obviously euron greyjoy came out of nowhere and claimed the seastone chair like donald claimed the republican nomination also from out of nowhere drowned sawane botley like donald drowned jeb bush defeated both the more moderate asha greyjoy and the traditional ironbornvaluesholding victarion greyjoy in the kingsmoot similar to how donald defeated the moderate marco rubio and traditional conservativevaluesholding ted cruz establishment damphair trying to stop him after its too late similar to the republican party establishments attempts to derail donald after it was too late mysterious connections to magic and warlocks just as donald has seemingly magically captivated the attention of the electorate and even has his own wizard connection david duke cynically taken advantage of the ironborn culture of jingoism bravado and racism and turned it on its head to drive his own secret interests similar to trump selfdescribed highenergy winner that crews a ship of mutes silent majority and is rich from plundering far away kingdoms may have molested someone has weirdlooking lips
asoiaf,removed,trump illyryo hillary varys
asoiaf,removed,to avoid any confusion this isnt a mod certified tm post enjoy
asoiaf,removed,trumpaerys ii hes completely full of himself is extremely entitled owes any success he has to his father makes grandiose boasts that will never come to fruition and is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is probably raped a few ladies in his daythere are quite a few parallels clintoncersei is completely full of herself is extremely entitled blatantly corrupt and is very very unlikable
asoiaf,removed,grrm said himself on his blog the other days stannis is not trump stannis had honor trump is a baratheon alright hes joffery older but no wiser hilary is easily cersei anyone that tells you shes not is off their rocker
asoiaf,removed,trump reminds me of janos
asoiaf,removed,when i think about twow and ados this point pops into my head sometimes plus the time between adwd and now makes me hope and pray this is the case we know that there is a substantial plot in adwd that was moved to twow that is the battle of ice stannis versus the freys who knows how much of that was meant to be in adwd perhaps just that battle it could be more so we know at least a chunk was there its also conceivable that there was more written that was likely held especially due to grrm jumping around when he hits a wall with a character or storyline
asoiaf,removed,any chance of a link to the spoilers please
asoiaf,removed,im gonna build an ice wall and the walkers are gonna pay for it
asoiaf,removed,this is typically the choice of a person who has an iq of a carrot
asoiaf,removed,i am an afghani warlord in the me and my wives live in my expansive mansion paid for by my massive opium manufacturing and distributing i pass the time by warring with my enemies raping their children and sponsoring my buzkashi team to play against other afghan warlords my people bend to my iron will and know that if they ever attempted to rebel i would crush them and their families
asoiaf,removed,because theyre morons
asoiaf,removed,was this post inspired by a certain leak s i think theres a he failing to a certain couples daughters is rather poetic
asoiaf,removed,cough general warning lets just say youre wasting your time yezen for context you can find the removed comments in on his profile start with the one made one day ago it sits at and starts with it seriously feels like this season is being written by this subreddit omfg gaiz wat if edd was el cee teehee ser mlady has been popping into very many threads on a seeming warpath against the show with gems like jesusattention deficit disorderchrist it seriously feels like theres a room of year olds hopped up on adderall writing the scripts for this shit and this is the sub for the books if youre such a staunch fanboy of the show go circlejerk over on rgameofthrones in other news now that you have res that option to tag users is mighty useful isnt it im fond of lego recently
asoiaf,removed,thank god some people can move past the circlejerk this community would be garbage otherwise so many people thinking theyre being original and fresh and when bitching that the show is not the book
asoiaf,removed,that said unlike pretson i think bloodraven is ultimately in a manner of speaking a good person trying to do the right thing its incredibly morally shady pick one or the other unless a more accurate interpretation of what you think is that hes trying to do the right thing from his perspective i dont tout that there are any dark lords in asoiaf nor do i think there are any true protagonists everyone is morally gray and those who claim to hold the answers are religious zealots on which grrm has negatively commented for years i personally think that once the targaryen dynasty fell bloodraven forsook humanity entirely he went north to work with the cotf in order to slowly and deliberately orchestrate a massive war between humanity and the others who i think are just be a mutated subspecies of human to leave the humans so weak that the cotf can reemerge and retake westeros from the descendants of the andals and first men this parallels ilyrio and varyss plan to weaken the realm through war in order to pave a road for either dany or faegon to retake westeros which is actually an amazing irony it also plays to the motivations of the cotf who almost certainly want revenge for the breaking of the pact all sides end up morally gray which one of the most consistent themes of grrms stories war solves nothing
asoiaf,removed,did you even watch the fucking video the dude analyzes whether or not the fight is well done not if its fucking faithful to the series which we have no idea about that fight in detail and im sure that dude knows more about your armchair warrior ass
asoiaf,removed,not including the whole dialogue isnt dumbing down you bloody manbabies
asoiaf,removed,all right i guess we dont all share your genius
asoiaf,removed,hello troll whats your name i have some nice saltines for you
asoiaf,removed,you literally just said it was cliffsnotes minutes ago

asoiaf,removed,this trash doesnt belong here
asoiaf,removed,why am i being down voted cmon people its a joke guess no more redditing while drinking for me everything is funny right now
asoiaf,removed,look at there are waxed labia in these pics seeing outer labia and partial inner labia doesnt count as seeing vagina anymore so if you saw a waxed woman with no pants on you wouldnt say you saw her vagina so you technically literally need to see a woman spread eagle with her literal entire vagina showing to say you saw vagina im literally just curious because it seems like the rules must be different nowadays
asoiaf,removed,beautiful audition this motherfucker better end up on the iron throne
asoiaf,removed,instant fucking headache i mean instant motherfucking headache youre on some other shit
asoiaf,removed,you are trash

asoiaf,removed,is this legit or just speculation
asoiaf,removed,chill ñigga
asoiaf,removed,they are pretty mismatched the tyrion in kings landing illustration clearly fits better with clash in which he is quite prominent while the feast one represents a search for bran and rickon
asoiaf,removed,we wont know until sunday night
asoiaf,removed,jon snow
asoiaf,removed,episodes people on the internet complain
asoiaf,removed,jesus christ why does it even matter that youre being downvoted stop being so fragile were on the internet talking about a freaking series of fantasy novels that hasnt been updated in years grow up
asoiaf,removed,anything where danaerys is in power i dont hate dany but i think shes an idiot ruler and shouldnt be queen on anything
asoiaf,removed,not really fredo was an incompetent bumbling idiot
asoiaf,removed,well if that is the case then damn sansa youre an idiot
asoiaf,removed,i call a spade a spade if you dont like it fuck off
asoiaf,removed,one of my favorite bbp moments comes in twow preview chapter tyrion when brown ben turns his cloak back to daenerys there is chaos in the yunkish camp with no clear leadership he notes that the windblown have gone over to danny and the orders given to the second sons to defend the harridan doesnt make sense as they are a cavalry unit and defence is better suited to infantry while the slaver envoy is demanding that tyrion be handed over as an escaped slave he turns his cloak with style the yunkishman glared at the dwarf hold your tongue you verminous little— his retort withered this insolent dwarf is an escaped slave he declared shocked he is the property of the noble yezzan zo qaggaz of hallowed memory you are mistaken he is my brotherinarms a free man and a second son yezzans slaves wear golden collars brown ben smiled his most amiable smile golden collars with little bells do you hear bells i hear no bells collars can be removed i demand that the dwarf be surrended for punishment at once that seems harsh jorah what do you think this mormonts longsword was in his hand as the rider turned ser jorah thrust it through his throat the point came out the back of the yunkishmans neck red and wet blood bubbled from his lips and down his chin the man took two wobbly steps and fell across the cyvasse board scattering the wooden armies everywhere he twitched a few more times grasping the blade of mormonts sword with one hand as the other clawed feebly at the overturned table only then did the yunkishman seem to realize he was dead he lay facedown on the carpet in a welter of red blood and oily black roses ser jorah wrenched his sword free of the dead mans neck blood ran down its fullers the white cyvasse dragon ended up at tyrions feet he scooped it off the carpet and wiped it on his sleeve but some of the yunkish blood had collected in the fine grooves of the carving so the pale wood seemed veined with red all hail our beloved queen daenerys be she alive or be she dead he tossed the bloody dragon in the air caught it grinned we have always been the queens men announced brown ben plumm rejoining the yunkaii was just a plot and what a clever ploy it was tyrion gave the dead man a shove with his boot if that breastplate fits i want it
asoiaf,removed,hnnng
asoiaf,removed,just like whites would force blacks to do
asoiaf,removed,this kid sucksssss
asoiaf,removed,youre really hung up on fake deaths to me its a superficial complaint well yes because when reading a decent book i expect the events happening not to feel like im watching general hospital with my former roommate but even if that were true none of it is explored so it might as well be the same thing yes it is on more than one occasion its made all but explicit im sorry you and martin missed it dont dish it out if you cant take it mate youve been a massive bellend to everyone else in this thread take your own advice im giving you what youve given out false do you think lord karstark wanted peace with the lannisters of course he did in his case just a peace in which there are remarkably fewer lannisters around everyone desires peace just their peace i think it was clausewitz who said the goal of war is a more favourable peace and augustine said much the same catelyn was willing to put aside whatever negative impulses she had to look for a better way except for those times she killed people and kidnapped people and took them to a kangaroo court in full expectation of their death or life imprisonment sure again thats not what happened in the story she went through the vale to get him to winterfell not to try him at the eyrie false false false shes angry because lysa tries her prisoner not because tyrion who she has effectively no reason to believe actually guilty deserves any better in her eyes again you missed the part that even if true it was at the end where she was completely broken ah so her living actions only count sometimes if her behaviour after resurrection is identical to that just before her death well just handwave it away because she had already gone mad are you even listening to yourself the authors voice is the most important voice in concerns to the story and intention counts for a lot imo and this is why you dont write literary criticism clearly what youve just said is so far removed from academic consensus that it boggles the mind grrms editor is the one that made him take out the battles of ice and fire no that was the publisher due to physical constraints his editor suffered through the pompous old windbag writing stet over all her edits anyways a lot of your critiques of the story just doesnt factor into what i actually care about im chuffed you love it mate but dont pretend its generally seen as one of if not the weakest effort this isnt coincidental nor is it some mass psychosis and youre over here telling me its too slow not at all too slow would imply any motion whatsoever you dont like the structure and characters say words are wind too many times too many fake out deaths and i mean those are legitimate complaints but they seem like minor quibbles those are not minor quibbles they are necessarily indicative examples of an overriding decline in prose quality editorial quality plotting pacing and narrative format that you prefer a story like shades of gray to adwd makes me wonder why youre even on reddit to talk about the series because something lowbrow thats appropriately written and achieves its aims is more competently done than adwd a good big mac is better than a ruined bouillabaisse also that comment just reeks of an america love it or leave it attitude if asoiaf book came out and was worse than shades of gray id drop it faster than a sack of potatoes it did and i did its called adwd when were talking kings were not were talking hobbits im sorry you missed even the most heavyhanded meanings in tolkien how that king rules shouldnt be outside the scope of the story if you honestly think how hrothgar and agamemnon built roads and walls and shit has a legitimate place in beowulf and illiad then so be it but just know you have horrible taste and dont understand literature in the slightest this is why i said basically and not actually except its not basically its not at all but even so nothing couldve stopped tolkien from giving complete command to aragorn and see how he did things and nothing was stopping martin from making tyrion break out into a flurry of hall oates songs but he didnt because it wouldnt be in keeping with the tone or themes of the work aragorn isnt a peripheral character hes the lead character when the story isnt focused on hobbits yes he is no he isnt we have chapters spent with him in the lead role we have chapters spent with areo and arys in the lead role theyre fucking peripheral characters mate i get that tolkien was intentionally writing from the basis of myths and legend and i give a lot of leeway to tolkien because of that lotr is one of my favorite fantasy novels strange that you ignore all that and dont seem to understand his work then but im criticizing the character of aragorn from a modern standpoint i do that less with characters like agamemnon because they were products of their time from a different culture special pleading got it i thought you said that if kings were on the table we should know how many groats they taxed each manor and how many workmen were hired to build a church and how many bushels of barley they ate but its also lazy cliched writing no its not even if it were cliches are not inherently bad and even if they were inherently bad the rejection of them can often be worse look at enormous swathes of recent literature for examples of that i think youre going to see a wave of shows influenced by got for a time yes sure for a time and people will still be reading sophocles and shakespeare and cervantes and stories about cinderella and snow white long after martins star wanes i think the crux is that nice people dont necessarily make good rulers same with bad people being a good leader is apart from being a good person this is an extraordinarily different claim from your initial one and even more so from martins position which is the laziest most cliche teenage vietnamera student philosophy i can imagine most american presidents arent good people but weve had some great leaders utter rot most presidents have been perfectly good people just as almost everyone whos ever lived is a fundamentally good person the world is not westeros and martins snide fauxenlightened oh isnt everything a bit shit and isnt everyone evil and isnt power so nasty ideology is one of the worst diseases to plague the modern world
asoiaf,removed,i wouldnt skip anything theres a lot in every got ep even if it isnt filled with action
asoiaf,removed,no blackwater is the actual battle
asoiaf,removed,ok mccarthy it seems you are unable to value a historical figure sure che guevara did a lot of bad thing which i do not agree with but doesnt every leader im not saying he was a saint or anything i personally do not agree with his views but i do acknowledge him as a historically important figure which did very good and bad things come on we are not in the anymore not everyone who isnt a republican is a communist and what if i were isnt the us a free country oh one last thing george rr martin is a known leftist
asoiaf,removed,is this a spoiler or a basic plot point at the ops point in the story its clear that spoiler i guess youknowwho is going to attack so its not like im giving anything away plus heshe clearly has some knowledge of the episode contents too since heshe talked to others about it modfail
asoiaf,removed,rasoiafcirclejerk
asoiaf,removed,seventysix trombones led the big parade with a hundred and ten coronets close at hand they were followed by rows and rows of the finest virtuosos the dream of evry famous band
asoiaf,removed,yeah there are a couple of reasons i like rawrist but really shes got some great breakdown videosreviews and she has a really dry wit too
asoiaf,removed,very interesting definitely reminds me of the children of the forest
asoiaf,removed,id argue they were laid after the end of the nine penny kings war this is where a lot of high lords met and fought along each other and formed important friendships its how petyr baelishs father met hoster tully for example and it resulted it petyrs wardship under the tullys more importantly it is likely where jon arryn met rickard stark and steffon baratheon leading to jons raising of ned and robert wardships were the first step in forming stronger bonds between the great houses betrothals were another step robert and lyanna were betrothed jaime and lysa tully were almost betrothed if not for tywin naming jaime to the kg its not completely known why these houses tried to form alliances through wardships and betrothals though the southron ambitions theory is a likely candidate so yes the tournament of harrenhal was huge in terms of laying the seeds of rebellion against the targs but it was also indeed a long time coming
asoiaf,removed,a lot of similarities for sure especially if you consider odin adding people to his army of the dead
asoiaf,removed,casual viewers have no idea about toj unless they are turned on by readerly obsessed friends broadly agree although your usage of readerly is completely wrong its just another place where there is a sword fight someone sounds smug most people dont know how to read anymore dae us special bookreaders are so much smarter than those plebeian especially complex books asoiaf is hardly complex prose your implying that is is suggests something about your own reading level
asoiaf,removed,yes i read somewhere he compared them to the sidhe also although there are definitely some creepy elements of the wild hunt displayed through ramsay he sets girls free and gives them a head start sounds his horns and hunts them with his dogs to the hunted hearing the sounds of a hunt begin signifies death for sure
asoiaf,removed,sweet summer child
asoiaf,removed,jon did have an heir i believe it was a nephew who either died at the tower of joy or was executed after accompanying brandon to kings landing
asoiaf,removed,isnt his heir a nephew i believe was killed at the battle of the trident so thats when he agreed with hoster tully to marry his younger daughter
asoiaf,removed,you are trying to defend dany of course you are downvoted
asoiaf,removed,he also arranged robert to marry cersei who would eventually kill him and make war on his house failed to gain proof of bastardy of cerseis children he could have sent gendry to the vale immediately and taken a solo trip with robert up there so he could hear the truth and see it in gendry and mya failed to prevent robert from mistreating stannis failed at forcing some responsibility of governance on robert frankly it was stupid for them to name robert the king when they could have created a ruling council of lords like rhaegar planned or whatever
asoiaf,removed,ciri danaerys geralt jon roach hodor
asoiaf,removed,and jon snowciri either rules westerosnilfgaard and northern realms becomes a wildlingwitcher or dies that wildling thing was so forced
asoiaf,removed,yeah thats a boar an animal they hunt arthur dayne is well arthur dayne and attacking peoples necks is usually the way to go against opponents wearing full plate armor then again you are here once more sniffing anything slightly imperfect about robert so you jump to his defense because saying robert would probably lose to a guy who was by all accounts the best swords man alive at the time is obviously insulting to him jeez
asoiaf,removed,its worth noting that the case of myranda royce would imply that even if arryn was seeking a wife he didnt need to rebel against his king to get one old lords marrying young noblewomen is par for the course in the books likewise although arryn does gain a great deal of power after the war no one could realistically have predicted that would be a likely outcome when he first rebelled the most likely outcome was that arryn would die along with large numbers of his friends and family if arryn wanted power or a wife his best bet was remaining loyal to aerys in addition you cant blame littlefinger or cersei on arryn who would realistically think i shouldnt give this extremely talented person a job on the off chance he will manage to take country of all the nations finances and manipulate my wife into starting a civil war or who would say i shouldnt let my ward marry into a powerful noble family that irrevocable threw away any chance of changing sides on the off chance the lannister twins might be incestuous those are both minuscule odds that both came up snake eyes is too improbable pin the blame on arryn
asoiaf,removed,i dont think well get a tower scene i think episode im exciting for the first stark reunion and what sansas reaction is to undead jon and obviously danys big bbq moment i saw a spoiler on wotw from that nude recapped website that says emilia will have a hot nude scene which probably means a pyre moment im ready for her to take over the dothraki
asoiaf,removed,so the simple answer is if you are not from us and you miss the episode on your local channel your only chance to see the episode is to browse the internet
asoiaf,removed,so you think the northern lords will follow a bastard over a true stark and thats why sansa will marry i didnt downvote but your idea totally loses me for this reason there is nothing to gain marrying jon
asoiaf,removed,if you really love dd writing then everything be big for you even inches or tall girl
asoiaf,removed,no you dont understand idiot hes the best writer of all time because he subverts expectations
asoiaf,removed,beric has a new actor damn it i loved scotts performance
asoiaf,removed,what a cunty attitude
asoiaf,removed,warning there are major set leak spoilers below we are discussing how to handle the issue
asoiaf,removed,i this sounds but hope dont pass it through the
asoiaf,removed,what fucking fan art
asoiaf,removed,of course im a browser i just lurk got and some mu threads do a reverse google search on these images and nothing pops up so why are they being removed i didnt post these and if theyre true i cant wait until they happen so i can laugh in this dumb mods face
asoiaf,removed,i was joking lol sry thought it came across as obvious sarcasm
asoiaf,removed,based on evidence for rlj and how everyone thonks its cannon already its pretty sure you are a blackfire or rhaegars bastard get hype ulorenzostomp the true king
asoiaf,removed,the tourney was a front for all the lords to come together and hold an unofficial grand council to figure out what to do about aerys but varys heard about it and tipped off the mad king
asoiaf,removed,can you link to the thread
asoiaf,removed,youre too unintelligent to discuss anything with
asoiaf,removed,jon learns that hes not really sansas brother then sansa arrives he tells her and sansa trusts it because shes always known it at heart sansa and jon get that twinkle in their eyes jon keeps thinking shes ygritte because of the beautiful read hair sansa realizes that hes honorable and has an army and can get their home back que sex scene then they agree to gather forces to march on winterfell and reclaim their homeland and get it prepared for the real threat from the far north
asoiaf,removed,maybe because its a retarded theory downvotes
asoiaf,removed,who gives a fuck you god damn nerd this show is made by hollywood get over it and the blue balls about the reveal after the fight is completely necessary wouldve been the wrong time for the reveal they need a bigger build up remember lots of people watch only the show and have never read the books this is going to be one of the biggest reveals of the entire series and there needs to be proper build up
asoiaf,removed,sorry mom
asoiaf,removed,ah yes i too joke about raping the sister that i hate all the time its how i show sibling love i also have this obsession with my first wife but its not like anyone can blame me isnt it its not like i helped gangrape her or anything of course shell take me back the moment she sees me and yes fucking a deadeyed slave who had no choice on what she does and who she does it with is a little different from fucking a whore at a brothel who has a choice to leave contrast tyrions first meeting with shae she went to him by her own choice fully aware of whowhat he is to his meeting with the sunset girl
asoiaf,removed,youve seen hodors penis its enormous and hes strong enough to rip another man in two imagine how he would wreck lyannas vag hodor is the reason she was bleeding to death
asoiaf,removed,youre right the theory kills itself by being retarded batshit crazy tinfoil drivel
asoiaf,not_removed,nothing in the most recent episode nothing concrete though some people may fashion tinfoil from things the theory goes that after arya left the hound for dead and went on her way he didnt die there just so happened to be the next best thing to a maester behind the rock over there the elder brother from the quiet isle who brienne meets the elder brother tells brienne that he came across the hound and his warhorse stranger whos on the quiet isle but that the hound died and he laid him to rest built a cairn and placed the dogs head helmet on it however its also mentioned that the elder brother has a gifttalent for healing or power as a healer also he seems to make a distinction when discussing the houndsandor he states the hound is dead but that sandor is at peace that could be taken as saying the hound persona died sandor let it go all the hate against the world and his brother etc and thus sandor isnt dead but hes at peace hes no longer the savage angry dog that he was present on the quiet isle is the gravedigger that brienne notes a big man with a limp sandor took a bad leg wound who septon meribalds dog seems to like per the theory the gravedigger is sandor clegane whos joined the community of penitents on the quiet isle
asoiaf,not_removed,s in affc brienne sees a man digging graves while shes on the quiet isle the long and short of it is that many people believe this is sandor clegane who was rescued and has now repented of his sins he will be recruited to fight against the mountain in cerseis trial by combat this is known as cleganebowl
asoiaf,not_removed,ive asked others and get zero response why would the hound decide to give up all his repenting and time spent atoning just to go back to violence like what reason does he have to combat the mountain wouldnt it kind of go against what hes been doing
asoiaf,not_removed,s the theory is that the faith will ask him to do it because hes one of the only people in westeros perhaps the only person who stands a chance against the mountain it may also parallel aryas own journey of trying to become a faceless man and failing which would be poetic given the time theyve spent together
asoiaf,not_removed,ive thought this as well sandor has found peace if hes the gravedigger hes left the hound persona and all the pain that goes with it behind him so why would he take up a life of violence again one of the motivations of the hound persona was the hatred sandor had for his brother one of the reasons possibly why he was willing to seek peace as he has is that he believed his brother to be dead he could no longer kill him the hound had nothing to live for so the hound died and sandor found peace but imagine cerseis trial by combat goes down and robert strongs monstrousness is uncovered he survives otherwise mortal wounds his helmet is knocked off etc or perhaps he goes on a sparrow killing spree word of that makes its way to the quiet isle and sandor realises his brother isnt dead how many foot tall knights are there in the realm and has become even worse than he was sandor sees himself as the only one that can rid the world of this abomination and so he picks up the sword again
asoiaf,not_removed,make peace with his brother and put him out of his misery
asoiaf,not_removed,low important stuff from roberts rebellion will most likely come out within the rest of asoiaf series what i really want the hedge knight minutes x the sworn sword minutes x the mystery knight minutes x hbo pls
asoiaf,not_removed,what do you think are the chances of us getting a prequel series set during the war of the usurper this is used so rarely i cannot help but take notice d
asoiaf,not_removed,a tv series you mean i cant really see it as much as id love it no dragons direwolves ice zombies shadowbabies and a bunch of characters that are not nearly as fleshed out as the characters in asoiaf then there is the fact that there is a handful of paragraphs on roberts rebellion there is not nearly the same source material that agot uses if hbo or another network wanted to do an epic medieval war there are multiple real life examples to use they have no need of using a fictional one however the one possibility is that hbos shows might tank after agot finishes and some exec gets a little desperate and commissions a spinoff recent hbo dramas have been lacklustre in their viewing figures despite their quality
asoiaf,not_removed,i think de is most likely almost custom made for an episodic tv series dunk and egg traveling westeros solving mysteries and righting wrongs
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm has mentioned wanting to do a few projects dunk and egg fire and blood and none of those projects are the one youre talking about part of the reason is that hes clearly telling the story of roberts rebellion in asoiaf but hes not doing it in a straightforward way its more of a puzzle and hes leaving the details to later books so i dont think hell ever write that particular prequel series especially at his current writing speed
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the chances of a game of thrones spin off is low and i think thats fine i dont think a rr spin off would work i dont think a dunk egg spin off would work dance of the dragons has dragons and shocking twists so that might work but itd be expensive
asoiaf,not_removed,personally i would not wont one because it would strip away the one reason asoiaf is so persistent in its success namely intrigue this of course rests on a huge amount mystery as to what happened in the past thus i think a prequel to asoiaf would be detrimental to the series not helpful but in terms of how successful it is depends on if grrm writes it eg if it is a hbo thing then it wont work
asoiaf,not_removed,i think we might see some novellas about it but not a full series
asoiaf,not_removed,if i were a producer in on a new series or something i would avoid roberts rebellion more than anything else the constant criticism of how scenes should have been over your every writing casting or shooting decision just wouldnt be worth it
asoiaf,not_removed,somehow i can easily imagine a more serious version of a xenaesque dunkegg adventures series being about their many exploits starting light with a chipper young princeling and his hedge knight friend until taking a darker turn after a season or two when politics and targaryen drama kicks in
asoiaf,not_removed,there is a chance and a lot of people are against the idea of roberts rebellion because either theres not enough source material or its yet to be revealed or it should stay a mystery etc im all for it though i think it definitely has the most interesting characters the more epic storyline it is so eventful and tragic that the story nearly writes itself so i dont think hbo would have a problem filling in the blanks if grrm is unable to provide his own narrative
asoiaf,not_removed,virtual certainty got is now an established universe like star wars star trek marvel etc studios can more easily finance the production of a show it movie with an established fan base a great example is the dc universe batman did ok im the then languished with a flop im and christopher nolan could still get million to make a fifth sequel in ie batman begins even now they are funding the expansion of the universe with justice league etc disney paid billions to wrest star wars from george lucas because they had better ideas in how to invest and reap billions more now we are getting a star wars movie every year for the foreseeable future what im saying is as long as it is legally possible were going future up to our neck in game of thrones its too established to leave unexploited wishes of grrm and the inevitable structure of his estate is probably the key fof the
asoiaf,not_removed,money
asoiaf,not_removed,a new series based on either dunk and egg or the dance of the dragons would mean adapting unfinished work by grrm please hbo lets not do that again
asoiaf,not_removed,it would be great if the prequels were decades before the main story like maybe say years before oh and maybe it can focus on a one of maester aemons relatives and his future lord commander of the kingsguard
asoiaf,not_removed,i think a prequel series would do well if its basically a single season for a specific event they can reuse the same actorscharacters but each season has to be a standalone story in the game of thrones history so roberts rebellion could be one season dunk egg could have one or two stories to make a season each out of i think with prequels less is more you have to pick a story that matters and can have enough content to fill a season and leave it at that dont try to milk it for years
asoiaf,not_removed,think harry potter its great right lovely books lots of people read when they were in middle school growing up well it got real popular and eventually greed kicked in they made an abomination called the cursed child and tanked the entire world of harry potter thats what hbo would do with asoiaf if they made a prequel series they would add their own inventions in and grrm would have very little to do with it most like
asoiaf,not_removed,i always thought theyd be bound to do a series on dunk and egg focusing a lot on the blackfyre rebellions
asoiaf,not_removed,chance well get something else from westeros after the series ends since hbo only owns the rights to everything in asoiaf id say well either get roberts rebellion or they create a new story set in the universe
asoiaf,not_removed,first not a prequel series have you seen how large this world is the known world is only a fragment of planetos as a whole the eastern part of essos sothoryos ulthos are teaming with lore that we havent even considered dont make a prequel series george needs to let other authors into his world much like star wars eu let these people tell official stories in his world and he can regulate them once some good stories are taking place in other areas and complete them make a got spin off series based in the asoiaf eu
asoiaf,not_removed,but a part series but not necc that war
asoiaf,not_removed,between the tourney at harrenhall the trident the sacking of kings landing and the tower of joy i think an or so episode bobby bs rebellion miniseries would be awesome
asoiaf,not_removed,it is the perfect spinoff from game of thrones the characters are familiar to casual viewers the storyline is mentioned enough in the main series for casual viewers to not be confused and it would be significantly cheaper due to the lack of dragons and direwolves plus they have a general plot plan from grrm and then they would be able to flesh it out on their own i think it is the best possible option for hbo following game of thrones we all want the dance of the dragons or aegons conquest but i just dont think that is feasible considering the huge cost of cgi for dragons and the dance has over a dozen at this point roberts rebellion is just the perfect prequel to transition from the main series to the history for readers hardcore viewers and casual viewers alike
asoiaf,not_removed,i truly dont know why people are so dismissive of a prequel miniseries about roberts rebellion but are keeping their fingers crossed for something as irrelevant as dunk and egg its completely illogical
asoiaf,not_removed,roberts rebellion would be the commercial choice but as well as it being expensive i think dunk and egg would be a better story to tell it could have an older demographic as well as maybe even a younger one not that they would dumb it down
asoiaf,not_removed,i have said this before and i will say it again i think with the recent new harrenhall conspiracy which i am a firm believer in suggests there was a lot more scheming going on than meets the eye therefore it would be very possible for a prequel series to come out maybe set during or at the end of the penny kings war so we meet the big players tully lanister stark aryn aerys and see how they become friends this is where the scheming begins we start seeing the development of the southron ambitions we start seeing the development of tywin and aerys friendship season two would then take a time jump where the sons and daughters of the southron ambition houses are being fostered all over the place we also start seeing tywin as the hand of aerys season ends with duskendale season three is where it really ramps up and we end at harrenhall season four would then be the rebellion
asoiaf,not_removed,we get multiple prequels not sure what they will be but there is not a chance hbo is letting this money cow die
asoiaf,not_removed,if the ending dd write for the show isnt shit a very good chance hbo likes money theyre not going to turn down the chance to adapt more of that world if they didnt it would be like a sitting president not running for a second term
asoiaf,not_removed,id say if it was going to happen the brexit vote made it less likely from a cost and ease perspective
asoiaf,not_removed,yeeessssss id also take a dance of the dragons spin off series
asoiaf,not_removed,is there even enough content for and a half hours per novella
asoiaf,not_removed,i was thinking just a part miniseries minutes each then again ive only read the first one it was a lot of fun escalated quickly
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope so but i want a few more years for cgi to get cheaper so they can really make it good
asoiaf,not_removed,wont be dance unless hbo buys the rights to it
asoiaf,not_removed,i think that if westworld isnt a hit a got spinoff project will start to be developed to be ready the year after the final season
asoiaf,not_removed,i want this badly
asoiaf,not_removed,people want roberts rebellion the same way star wars fans wanted to see how darth vader turned to the dark side
asoiaf,not_removed,another analog is harry potter which was mentioned in another comment even though the author professed that the universe was being retired were starting to see tangential books and movies these sorts of established universesfan bases are too attractive to easily leave unexploited even better example gone with the wind book movie has contended with numerous unauthorized sequels and prequels one was the httpsenmwikipediaorgwikithewinddonegone and stood up in court as parody ie protected by first amendment rather than prohibited by copyright so we will see plenty of got since there is a huge and interested fan base plus multipe points of entry besides the candidates listed by the op eg perspective shifts like rosencrantz and guildenstern or enders shadow
asoiaf,not_removed,yep and we will never have another harry potter book or movie rip harry potter
asoiaf,not_removed,im a bit worried sometimes that with the tv series the final few episodes may turn into a lotr like battle at the black gate with a fellowship of selfless dogooders doing something to safe the day deep behind enemy lines in the land of always winter i really hope im wrong here because i do love the tv series also i do trust that grrms final book will have a genius and deeper meaning to its ending but where books need a deep and mysterious narrative for an ending to keep things exciting tv shows tend to work the opposite where action often draws the viewer more than dialogue does
asoiaf,not_removed,hbo is funded in dollars which now have more purchasing power after the postvote currency exchange rate so how is this more expensive
asoiaf,not_removed,why should it if the uk government decide to make it cheap and easy for people to film what the fuck can europe do
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps not all three audiobooks added up comes to about hours
asoiaf,not_removed,cgi is getting better but is it getting less expensive i imagine of the cost is people artists or programmers and that wont change whether they are doing claymation or cgi
asoiaf,not_removed,if they get peter jackson to direct it they could make a trilogy out of it
asoiaf,not_removed,i think you could totally fit roberts rebellion into four seasons of tv the first season could be all the preamble the characters the background the tourney at harrenhal the southron ambitions the mad kings insanity the intrigue and drama between ragaer and his loyalists vs the north and then culminates with lyannas kidnapping the second season would be the foundation of the rebellion brandon rides for kings landing the inner turmoil of the vale can start here then brandonrickards executions the vales revolt the defiance of marq grafton jaimes maturation as a member of the kings guard watching a man hes sworn to protect to evil things ned fleeing to the north to call his banners the third and fourth seasons would mainly revolve around battles and the innerturmoil of kings landing we could follow jon conningtons pov as he serves as hand and is ultimately exiled i think theres tons of material to build a series out of the rebellion but it would take some work to craft new pov characters outside of the main players of the series perhaps one of the cerwyns acts as a pov of one of the stormlands houses that switched sides after robert beat them
asoiaf,not_removed,dunk and egg could be a mini series imo
asoiaf,not_removed,theres no way westworld wont be a hit
asoiaf,not_removed,if you strip out the story game of thrones is an exotic fantasy action show with production based in the uk that does a ton of location shooting in other european countries most notably iceland and croatia the show and its people need to be able to move freely across those borders to make the show for weeks or months at a time and as weve seen from dorne that just swapping in a local production company is risky plus belfast is a big location for game of thrones and the economy of northern ireland is in a really weird and risky place with brexit in this case specifically you might have crew or production people who drive in from the republic of ireland for work so there are two ways i see this might have gotten in the way of something like a prequel miniseries the main justification for it would be to get a big chunk of the game of thrones audience by reusing a lot of work theyve already done or done before scouting the locations how the crew works together to bang out shoots how you move the footage into editing and what to look for etc having winterfell and kings landing already done from a set and a cgi compositing standpoint and you just use fewer and maybe less expensive actors than the main cast and make some small tweaks to keep it a bit fresh but overall you can be reasonably confident it will work and people will like it if all of a sudden because of taxes or work permits or visas you have to either find new locations for shooting which means you need more new cgi work for the compositing or move your postproduction to a different country that is a huge expense and risk that would eat up a lot of the benefit of making this rather than some other show and it would put in doubt that the end product would be of a recognizable quality to the existing audience since we dont know the time frame of brexit the process or how the negotiations will go its quite possible that sometime down the road therell be a temporary stoppage of work on these kinds of projects if that falls in the middle of your shooting schedule even if its just a couple of weeks thats a huge pain in the ass and could jeopardize getting the show done in time for all your contractual agreements with your cast and to hit your release on hbo game of thrones already has enough trouble with availability and delays as it is even if something like this never happens this risk of it happening if i were hbo would make me hesitant to double down on more game of thrones than ive already committed to doing especially if you kind of know its a lesser spinoff project its just a lot of risk for a show that is very expensive even on a good day
asoiaf,not_removed,the production were receiving money in the form of grants and what not from the eu i believe which is one of the main reasons the production in northern ireland was in doubt after brexit because these funds would be lost if they really wanted to they could just move an hour down the road to donegal which is still in the eu and has many of the same similar landscapes for a prequel series
asoiaf,not_removed,the tldr game of thrones mostly shoots in northern ireland croatia and to a less important extent spain you need to be able to move people money and commercial enterprises freely through at least those three countries in order to make the show the way its made now if you wanted to make a show entirely shot in the uk youd make a different show or at least youd have to start over a lot from scratch
asoiaf,not_removed,well if the technology gets simpler and less timeconsuming these people work less hours on a project and then it gets cheaper
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm has said that to stories are planned for the de series i think they could get seasons just out of that we know that hbo isnt afraid to go off of the source material too so they probably wouldnt wait for grrm to finish them they could take the series all the way up to summerhall i think it would be pretty cool if they tied a bunch back to the original got series like the origins of brienne aemons reasons for joining the watch danys dragon eggs etc
asoiaf,not_removed,well you never know true detective did fail in season vinyl was a flop hbo isnt immune to failures and a show looking good isnt necessarily good i certainly hope not but we never know
asoiaf,not_removed,the production were receiving money in the form of grants and what not from the eu i believe which is one of the main reasons the production in northern ireland was in doubt after brexit because these funds would be lost for the first few seasons yes but they havent received any eu money for years now they receive money from the uk and particular northern irish funds but none of them have anything to do with eu money the production in northern ireland was never in doubt because they dont get anything from the eu currently
asoiaf,not_removed,better does not mean simpler its usually the opposite im afraid
asoiaf,not_removed,you should read up why the hobbit was actually as bad as it was they had a different director at first but he quit and when peter jackson joined the team he had all this material he didnt want with no time to change it youre supposed to get a specific amount of time with the material to prepare as a director and he did not get that the hobbits failure was anybody but peter jack sons fault
asoiaf,not_removed,not to mention aegon is aerys father in show continuity
asoiaf,not_removed,oh okay yeah i agree a trilogy would be bunk
asoiaf,not_removed,there are around major plot points from season that im pretty sure will be in twow we know the two will end in the same way but as to how much will be actually spoiled i guess we really wont know until the books are released and we find out
asoiaf,not_removed,one of the dees once said well eventually meet up at pretty much the same place where george is going now some people interpret that as pretty much the whole end game will be spoiled others think it just means the very end will be pretty much the same s it seems likely that both are headed towards some kind of battle between humans and the others and i suspect the humans will win or the two sides will make peace anything else that happens will be a schrodingers spoiler of sorts maybe its a spoiler maybe its not we wont really know until the books are published thats good enough for me
asoiaf,not_removed,i heardread once that got took a strong independent course and that its gonna be radically different from martins future books even the endings you heard wrong the showrunners have been adamant since they beginning that they will have the same ending as the books it just might take a slightly different course getting there that said there are some major plot points which are obviously going to be the samesimilar in the books because dodging them would go too far off script to have the same ending you are very likely to see spoilers at some point
asoiaf,not_removed,in season five we went off bookway off book i decided to stay and see where the show runners would go with the series i can enjoy both literature film interpretations of literature i gave up on faithful adaptions a long time ago and have enjoyed films much more ever since once the media has passed into new hands those hands are going to mold it in some way sometimes good sometimes bad i just hope to be pleasantly surprised
asoiaf,not_removed,thers a grand total of two things that the show has really spoiled for me that would have been more thrilling to be hit with by martin but thats two out of hundreds of things im dying to have revealed and im so starved for twow that ill take anything i can get
asoiaf,not_removed,dungeonsdragons have said the endings will largely be the same the show will hit all the big points that actually matter first sure certain mysteries may be revealed differently in the future books that will never come out but the one that gets there first sets the standard its what everyone will be talking about when certain reveals are discussed if youre book only youre going to get spoiled to shit and there is sadly nothing you can do about it
asoiaf,not_removed,for me it wont matter too much if the series does turn out to mirror the final books in the series because ill often turn to the last pages of a novel to see how it ends and then go back to enjoy the journey ive also read books long before seeing the films lotr for example it didnt spoil the films at all
asoiaf,not_removed,im not scared at all the show has gone so off the rails and in my opinion lost a lot of the quality but thats a separate thing all together so much that i dont even think it can be loyal to the books some events might be the same but the story is not the same one being told
asoiaf,not_removed,im not worried theyve diverged a lot and if the surprises were a big part of asoiaf rereading wouldnt be as popular as it is
asoiaf,not_removed,just watch the show its the only way youll ever find out anything past adwd
asoiaf,not_removed,i tried watching the last season a lot of insignificant characters die a few characters that the show tried to make significant died as well all in all i fell asleep before ever finishing an episode anyway the people who did die in the show might not die in the books if it even happens the same way the best way to explain the show as it is now tell a year old a story have the year old repeat the story back to you a year olds version is the best episode of the season some of the other episodes are told by and year olds
asoiaf,not_removed,not for me because i dont want to be spoiled i dont watch the show i do not follow any media directly related to it but the goddamn thumbnails are telling more than enough an example i was once on a wikipedia for a game completely unrelated to got but the ads were full of got thumbnails and clickbait
asoiaf,not_removed,i think they said that in the beginning but after season martin and the shows writers seem to have gone their separate ways
asoiaf,not_removed,well im not one of those i must say weird people that look at the final pages and i once again big part of asoiaf is not being able to know whats gonna happen also i dont want the shitty show to ruin the ending moments for mei trust my own imagination and martins writing more than them
asoiaf,not_removed,loyal to what book an unpublished one
asoiaf,not_removed,but i dont want too its really bad
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree wholeheartedly that is a very good explanation how the show works right now
asoiaf,not_removed,i think youre missing the point just because it happens in the show doesnt mean its a spoiler maybe it is maybe it isnt you wont know either way until you read the books the only real spoiler will be the very ending to put that in perspective knowing that frodo drops the ring in mount doom doesnt really spoil lord of the rings we all know its gonna happen as soon as they establish that it must happen in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,ads are tailored to what you searchlook up the fact that you come to this sub is probably enough for them to target got ads towards you everywhere
asoiaf,not_removed,the most recent reference ive seen is from stuff benioff said in their interview with deadline right after season finished airing there are the books and the show and it would be a disservice to both if we went into too much detail on whether were going to use this or that so evidently he still thinks there are enough spoilers to merit not talking too specifically about the subject also on the subject of the ending were trying to tell one cohesive story with a beginning middle and end as dan said weve known the end for quite some time and were hurtling towards it the thing that has excited us from the beginning back to the way we pitched it to hbo is its not supposed to be an ongoing show where every season its trying to figure out new story lines we wanted it to be one giant story without padding it out to add an extra hours or because people are still watching it we wanted to something where if people watched it end to end it would make sense as one continuous story were definitely heading into the end game now
asoiaf,not_removed,they havent officially gone in separate ways grrm wrote one script per season till season after that he decided to devote his time to finishing twow main and probably only reason why he didnt write for seasons they still show him the general outline of the season prior to production
asoiaf,not_removed,by around season the threads started coming undone by season we were threadbare note im not saying its a bad thing just that its decidedly different and in my opinion an inferior product i have little mind to see anything that happens from onward as a spoiler if only because of the corners the show has cut and written themselves into some key events might be the same but key events arent what make the story good or even interesting the story of star wars is just farmer adopts an ancient religion joins a terrorist group and blows up a military base but the details inbetween make the story compelling for got vs asoiaf things that have happened in show might still transpire in later books but because of subtle plot differences dropped characters merged characters and budget constraints from as far back as season the details and subsequent story simply cannot be loyal to the books yet published they are telling decidedly different stories
asoiaf,not_removed,well the fact that something happens in the show well make me more inclined to believe its a spoiler because honestly i have no firm idea about asoiaf ending of course i would hope its just something they are pulling something out of their ass with the risk of sounding like an elitist prick i think we cannot apply conventional herostory logic to asoiaf part of the appeal is that i do not know what will happen
asoiaf,not_removed,good thats clarified then i just wish i fucking remembered what i was reading
asoiaf,not_removed,yes but how could they possibly be expected to tell a similar story or an adaption when there is no source material that exists unless they are physic so essentially what they are doing makes sense
asoiaf,not_removed,what your asking misses the point of what im saying op asked to what degree book fans should be afraid of spoilers from the show i asserted that even where the show does spoil the product is so different it doesnt matter and can barely even be called a spoiler at this point
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed
asoiaf,not_removed,one thing i think preston is misinterpreting i dont think eurons bloodeye is different than his onyx eye i interpreted this passage as confirmation that euron has a black pupil on a red background which is exactly the description of the eye on his person sigil one reason i find this so interesting is that his eyes represent opposites of each other one is white and blue the other black and red i think these color dichotomies are interesting because grrm has gotta be doing something with them there are whiteandred weirwoods that channel the power of the old gods and are expressed in bloodraven ghost melisandre etc and there are blackandblue trees which i believe are a type of ironwood that produce shade of the evening and must have something to do with the power of the undyingwarlocks of qarth however youll notice that those color expressions and dichotomies are inverted by euron he has blackandred opposing blueandwhite blueandwhite however does express itself elsewhere in the story the others as does blackandred drogon so eurons eyes tell the story in my opinion of the corruption of nature and magic he has heavy thematic ties to bloodraven when talking about dreams and flying and as preston argues telepathy and more explicit ties to the warlocks in service to potentially very destructive forces is he allying with the others in some way blueandwhite why he also clearly wants dragons again associated with blackandred in drogon the targaryenblackfyre sigils etc he even has valyrian armor i dont know what euron is up to but i love how his eyes seem to interact with the story
asoiaf,not_removed,if you havent done so you guys should really read and seven times never kill man i know people in this sun recommend tuft voyaging all the time but personally i found this short story to be one of george rr martins best
asoiaf,not_removed,it does seem like cheating a bit with preston when he builds his commentary off of his own speculative theories he mentions several times the thousand worlds parallels which are interesting as thematic references in the context of our author and the idea that the dragon horn controls people and not dragons but its all hypothesis really this is where i think he can get into some trouble and come off tinfoily in a lot of places that said this is great stuff as usual love the observed biblical parallels which are clearly sewn throughout the chapter now that hes pointed them out the inconsistencies with aerons own thoughts and memories and the vision itself was interesting too there might be something there one thing that popped out to me based on his commentary that he seems actually to have missed is that pj notices the oddity of aeron recognizing any of the gods which yeah how would he know that and the fact that the stranger being there is significant that said he pj doesnt seem to have noticed two omissions the great other of the lord of light religion although aeron does see rhllor the great other being missing works with pjs reading of euron as a force for darkness and the long night and the storm god of the ironborn religion i am the storm
asoiaf,not_removed,drugs are bad mkay
asoiaf,not_removed,he is selectively reading again says stuff like aeron becomes alcoholic after urris death and find the drowned god as coping mechanism but totally ignores his entire life as a hedonist and a near death experience that changed him then there is beyond olympic level of reaching and wrong facts like how drugs like lsd can make people insanely suggestible and malleable to others he is good at noticing small details but has hard time balancing probability with possibility
asoiaf,not_removed,preston rules
asoiaf,not_removed,bit disappointed with prestons more tinfoil thoughts in this compared to the theon videos took away from the imagery and darkness this chapter offered it doesnt have to be any particular person invading ones mind and instead can be opening the mind up to the network of thought around him its established magic is really really hard to control and even those trained in it resort to tricks to supplement the impact hope he pulls back on the futuros theory and instead just focus on how the visions play in the established stories
asoiaf,not_removed,i always thought of religion of the red god vs christianity comparison because of the intolerance the religion has shown towards other religions in the past even before the crusades christians were forcing slavic and germanic tribes to accept jesus or die

asoiaf,not_removed,love prestons vids and views he isnt telling people to believe everything bit worried that there is going to be a trap sprung by hosteen and ramsay sounds like big walder leading the frey forces first is a bit of a feint they could be sending him in first and watching to see what happens before the real forces come in to play cant wait for more reviews on the preview chapters thanks preston for keeping me entertained at work 👍🏻👍🏻
asoiaf,not_removed,one thing i think preston is misinterpreting i dont think eurons bloodeye is different than his onyx eye i interpreted this passage as confirmation that euron has a black pupil on a red background which is exactly the description of the eye on his person sigil i have a couple problems with this though one none of eurons family says anything other than that hes got a black eye under the patch they all note that its the blue eye thats the odd one the smiling eye and how uneasy they are when he shows that eye because it can hide anything its so odd it smiles whether euron is amused or not and that unnerves them you would think if euron had a blood red and black eye that that would be the one they constantly would talk and think about instead of his smiling eye they all know hes got another eye under the patch but never give it much thought beyond that that eyes black and filled with malice as compared to his smiling eye second that seems completely reasonable because i imagine if any ironborn ever birthed a child with a blood red eye theyd have tossed the baby into the sea to the drowned god given how unnatural that kid is the ironborn hate weakness euron himself killed robin simply because he was sickly and he could and aeron brushes aside robins death as if it were completely normal though he didnt know hed been murdered then and he brushes aside all the other deaths of quellons children as theyd been weak why would euron be allowed to live if he were born with such an overwhelmingly odd and unnatural trait thirdly theres actually a very interesting thing at play if euron covers his black eye see the thing is is that black eyes are the greyjoy eyes theyre the colour of his familys eyes balon and aeron both have them and while victarion asha and theons are never noted they probably have them too given that theyre all noted to be dark in colouring euron would be covering his normal greyjoy eye and exposing his odd blue eye to the world if he covers up his black eye hed be showing everybody how hes different from his brothers by covering up their similarity which is the opposite of what youd expect a normal person to do and euron obviously isnt normal fourth victarion says that euron was quellons most comely child a blood red eye isnt handsome at all he doesnt say he looked handsome when you covered up his garishly hideous red and black eye he said he was handsome period plenty of others attest to his handsomeness as well and nobody stops and thinks that a red eye which you suggest is there detracts from his looks when it obviously would fifth crows have black eyes not red and black eyes euron is called the crows eye eye not eyes because he only has a single black eye unlike his brothers who have two black eyes his nickname is a reference to the very fact that he was born with only a single black greyjoy eye i mean im not going to lie you made a lot of interesting ideas and parallels if euron has a blood red eye but they all do rely on that very assumption and once you assume something you can find any parallel you like if you try hard enough the only way i could see euron having such an eye is if his black eye has transformed into that either naturally or unnaturally and nobody is aware of it yet because otherwise the povs just never mentioning a red eye up until now is just odd like you yourself said whats the secret to the eye if nobodys commented on it
asoiaf,not_removed,the main thing hes always been misinterpreting is that asoiaf is not a scifi series its a fantasy series i cant help rolling my eyes when he tries to square circles with ridiculous ideas most of which are absurd because hes using grrms other works which some are scifi to fit his own crazy conjecture its also insulting that recently hes been talking about these chapters and what they mean or how they are references to everything he found on hours of wikipedia as if its correct and he wrote asoiaf himself i dont mind that he began suggesting stuff like maybe the weirwood network is a collective consciousness or whatever but over time hes become so stubborn and firm with abstractions that are not grounded within the series just because some of those concepts have been touched on in other martin works that again were scifi not to mention not a song of ice and fire i appreciate his enthusiasm and passion for sure but the wait between books has clearly taken a mental toll on him too so its not just this subreddit that is hashing out nonsense content where the top comment is deservedly so george pls
asoiaf,not_removed,bravo claps
asoiaf,not_removed,and the idea that the dragon horn controls people and not dragons this is one of the more popular theories among the fandom not something solely preston believes the horn is blown and euron overwhelmingly wins the kingsmoot despite having a pretty piss poor pitch and having pretty clearly murdered balon incredulously of all things aeron crowns him himself despite being vehemently opposed to such a thing which was the whole reason why he called the kingsmoot in the first place to avoid euron being king eurons followers then express all their doubts the same day that euron admits the hornblower died moqorro will later explain that the glyphs say that the horn binds those who hear it to the sounder victarion later recalls when moqorro asks him if hes heard it sound that the horn deeply affected him he felt the horns power aeron mentioned the same thing during his pov of the kingsmoot saying that eurons speech affected even him making him a believer for a time euron even admits that the horn affects humans during his kingsmoot speech why is a dragon horn affecting nondragons throw in that valyria had way way way more slaves than they had dragons and that the valyrian dragonlords tamed their dragons using mostly innate bonds shared between one dragon and one rider for life and its not really a stretch at all to say the horn affects humans when thats all weve ever seen it do
asoiaf,not_removed,mmm dont do drugs mkay mm drugs are bad drugs will let an evil sorcerer take control of your mind and help usher in the apocalypse mkay mkay mkay mister mackey
asoiaf,not_removed,aeron i believe was an alcoholic during his hedonism and then turned to religion after his nde and there might not be anything particularly magical or technological involved in the creation of shade of the evening but it could be a psychedelic edit that makes people vulnerable to telekinesis and therefore malleable in asoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,aeron becomes alcoholic after urris death and totally ignores his entire life as a hedonist you know that is the same thing right he was ina life of hedonism which is included becoming an alcoholic its pretty typical for someone who was molested to abuse substances and if they recover it is common to put faith into a higher power in the older theories about him getting raped like years ago before it was commonly accepted and confirmed was to show his drinking and finding god as a result of his abuse
asoiaf,not_removed,lsd can make people insanely suggestible and malleable to others has he been watching propaganda videos or something
asoiaf,not_removed,even before the crusades christians were forcing slavic and germanic tribes to accept jesus or die to be fair the romans were doing that before they were christians
asoiaf,not_removed,if by forcing you mean amalgamating cultures and folklore to align with christianity then yes

asoiaf,not_removed,edit heres the text when he laughed his face sloughed off and the priest saw that it was not urri but euron the smiling eye hidden he showed the world his blood eye now dark and terrible he is specifically hiding the smiling eye he is not hiding the black eye in this vision eurons black eye is the red eye you can interpret this a few ways maybe its red on white like a weirwood and bloodraven and its fine to be the wrong eye color because its a vision maybe its a red so dark that its basically black i personally think it is his black eye on red in light of his sigil aerons like thats his blood eye like he knows about it and its normal so thats how i reconcile it especially with the sigil in fact they all note that its the blue eye thats the odd one the smiling eye and how uneasy they are when he shows that eye theon sounds practically traumatized by the onyx eye the black one is his crows eye you would think if euron had blood red and black eye that that would be the one they feared given how unnatural that is to reiterate no that one totally is the one people find weird and unnatural the blue normal eye is mentioned as a contrast its kind of like a weird blue mockery of his real evil nature a metaphor for blue daario being a silly front for the evil euron anyone second that seems completely reasonable because i imagine if any ironborn ever birthed a child with a blood red eye theyd have tossed the baby into the sea to the drowned god given how unnatural that kid is i dont find this a compelling reason to think the white part of eurons eye isnt red thirdly theres actually a very interesting thing at play if euron covers his black eye see the thing is is that black eyes are the greyjoy eyes theyre the colour of his familys eyes balon and aeron both have them and while victarion asha and theons are never noted they probably have them too euron would be covering his normal greyjoy eye and exposing his odd blue eye to the world if he covers up his black eye hed be showing everybody how hes different from his brothers by covering up their similarity which is the opposite of what youd expect a normal person to do there are two things that dont make sense to me here if hes covering his black eye why is his other eye red why does aeron immediately recognize it as his blood eye instead of saying huh thats usually his blue smiling eye but now its red thats odd why does he refer to euron as euron bloodeye if the context is that yeah im talking about his blue smiling eye that was once red in a dream trip i had it makes much more sense to me that his black eye is his red eye by being a black pupil surrounding by red which is right on his personal coat of arms fourth aeron says that euron was quellons most comely child a blood red eye isnt handsome at all he can still be handsome but more relevantly he keeps his crows eye covered he has handsome features and keeps his weird eye under cover but they all do rely on that very assumption and once you assume something you can find any parallel you like if you try hard enough the only way i could see euron having such an eye is if his black eye has transformed into that either naturally or unnaturally and nobody is aware of it yet the strongest piece of evidence is that euron put his crows eye right on his sigil it is referred to as specifically a black pupil in a red eye once aeron said bloodeye i was like ooohhhhh that explains why his sigil is like that duh i would find it immensely strange if euron has a black pupil on a white background for an eye is known as bloodeye has aeron notice he has a red eye his sigil shows a black pupil on a red background as an eye and aeron came up with bloodeye because once he had a vision where eurons blue eye was red it just seems like a misstep from the otherwise consistent evidence that points to euron has a black pupil on red for one of his eyes
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree that its probably not secretly a scifi story set in the worlds universe but i do think grrms past work is a useful guide and he does have a tendency to repeat themes and character types so its really interesting to look at asoiaf through the lens of all his work combined
asoiaf,not_removed,its a fantasy series that comments on science and the mysteries thereof and on the unexplained yet manifestly meaningful i shouldnt be surprised if something like midichloridians pop up to further illuminate certain aspects of the weirnet fire magic blood magic cotf magic rhoynish water magic or the atypical seasons but ill be very surprised if it all comes down to psionics or if these magics are satisfyingly reduced very much further except in relation to each other and to sentient life
asoiaf,not_removed,im not sure how many times thy guy has to say that theres no subtext before people will believe him at least once if its so many do you mind pulling just one quote where the guy says there is no subtextsymbolism involved in the way i color things ill believe him if he said that he didnt though
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps its a slave binder
asoiaf,not_removed,i member
asoiaf,not_removed,it could be a psychedelic that makes people vulnerable to telepathy and therefore malleable in asoiaf grrm has another drug in his writings called esperon that functions in the exact same way making it easier for your mind to psychically affect others and others minds to affect you esperon esperon why was that important it had killed lasamer made him a victim of his own latent abilities multiplied his power and his vulnerability
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe the point is making is that aeron was an alcoholic before urris death and that it wasnt the death that was the catalyst
asoiaf,not_removed,what i meant was that it may not be related to guilt over urri death at all the prime focus of his memories about urri was about their mutual abuse at the hands of euron with others being additions if it was as preston said it would haven a spinning axe instead of a rusted hinge
asoiaf,not_removed,well as much as i enjoy his videos his tone of voice and way of speaking dont suggest a particularly sophisticated knowledge of mind altering substances
asoiaf,not_removed,manipulating people under the effects of lsd and other drugs is one of the ways manson brainwashed his followers along with his natural charisma
asoiaf,not_removed,but lsd does that its not used like that any more except in some circles with a guide but it does make the mind more receptive to some kind of outside influences and less receptive to others and some people know how to navigate that dmt is more known for those properties because most people try it with a guide that basically is someone brainwashing you
asoiaf,not_removed,romans were mostly tolerant towards other religions in europe at the time then a few jews told them that their god is the only god to exist and romans got angry no other religion at the time denied other people their gods
asoiaf,not_removed,by forcing i mean killing anyone who opposed it denying anyone else their belief killing infidels and burning witches learn some history christians werent so innocent
asoiaf,not_removed,removed for breaking the httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikicivilitypolicy dont be rude or insulting to users you disagree with
asoiaf,not_removed,removed for breaking the httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikicivilitypolicy dont be rude or insulting to users you disagree with
asoiaf,not_removed,the black one is his crows eye yes and crows have black eyes they dont have black and red eyes they have black eyes thats where the nicknames from hes nicknamed crows eye for his crows eye eye not eyes because his other eye is blue instead of its normal black greyjoys have black eyes euron has a black eye hence the nickname crows eye to denote that he only inherited one greyjoy black eye unlike the rest of his family
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps it is his black eye but it is bloodshot
asoiaf,not_removed,thats not really true though it shamed him still to recall the years that followed urris death at sixandten he called himself a man but in truth he had been a sack of wine with legs he would sing he would dance but not the finger dance never again he would jape and jabber and make mock he played the pipes he juggled he rode horses and could drink more than all the wynches and the botleys and half the harlaws too it was definitely urris death that led to aerons hedonistic depressive phase
asoiaf,not_removed,i find that unlikely as aeron was the youngest and urri died at i mean i guess aeron could have been a raging alcoholic at but that seems unlikely but neither matter as i stated the catalyst was his abuse that doesnt stop him from feeling responsible for his brothers death either way
asoiaf,not_removed,well this is my favourite comment in the thread
asoiaf,not_removed,the guide part is to put people in a positive mental state not control their actions the way preston is suggesting
asoiaf,not_removed,it doesnt the fact that the cia did decades long tests specifically to use it as a mind control drug or truth serum and came up empty handed tells us enough to know that it cant be used in the way suggested it can certainly fuck you up if not used in the right set and setting but thats another issue
asoiaf,not_removed,no other religion at the time denied other people their gods as long as they also worshipped roman gods even if by a different name and typically the romans brought in any deities that religion didnt have most importantly the emperor there was no real freedom of religion under rome with the exception of judaism in which like christianity worshipping the roman gods would be a denial of their god which the romans tolerated as a religion as their numbers were small and they found it more trouble than it was worth to enforce the imperial cult on them the roman were very troubled by christianity not because they denied other people their gods and a mostlylower class religion with very little people in power they couldnt but that they didnt accept those other peoples gods and worship them and then in the late century a couple of generations after toleration the roman emperor the leader of the imperial cult and deity in it banned pagan sacrifice
asoiaf,not_removed,learn some history christians werent so innocent true but they arent as guilty as you are making out eg they definitely didnt force slavic or germanic tribes to accept jesus or die that was the newlyconverted slavicgermanic tribal leaders hence why we have talk of kings like harald bluetooth converting to christianity and therefore denmark did in the late century having been tolerated by christendom next door for centuries the high middle ages had more of the persecution of openly nonbelieving people having brought a load of greek and islamic thought back west during the crusades the issue was with the concept of christendom it was entirely the notion that the ruler is christian therefore this is a christian country therefore christian law applies to everyone in it concept that every empire and every state in history beforehand and many since had had with their religions with the exception of the roman empire in the century that was only broken by christianity seeking to depaganise itself beginning in the latemedievalearlymodern period the issue isnt christians per se nor christian doctrine but christianity becoming the cool thing for the upper crust to pay lip service to and pagan doctrine on tribalism and what to do with unbelievers staying put in a mostly unconverted society that was nominally christian but constantly had real christians complaining about how these socalled christians were anything but
asoiaf,not_removed,dammit just trying to be funny
asoiaf,not_removed,black and red are fire colors white and blue are ice colors so i think he is symbolically grey as in half of each element of magic this could also be looked on as if he is whole where creatures like the others are only one half as they only have white and blue symbolism
asoiaf,not_removed,people inuniverse view the blue smiling eye as the normal one and people view the black one as scary and malicious and weird
asoiaf,not_removed,not sure why you are getting downvoted for actually having knowledge and stating historical facts so here have my upvote
asoiaf,not_removed,in the future avoid jokes about burning other users
asoiaf,not_removed,yes i get all that im saying this only works if euron has a red eye though which is never brought up until this very chapter where aeron is suddenly tripping balls
asoiaf,not_removed,fair enough
asoiaf,not_removed,which is never brought up until this very chapter the strongest piece of evidence for this theory is actually before this chapter namely that the eye euron decided to put on his banners could be his own crows eye
asoiaf,not_removed,or his sigil is just red and black precisely because thats the colour euron already uses for his ship silence he also never had a crown before the kingsmoot but that suddenly appeared on his banners too did he have a crown all along or is this rightfully a new thing and that hes incorporating new stuff into his banner
asoiaf,not_removed,that you can come up with an alternative explanation doesnt make my point notevidence did he have a crown all along or is this rightfully a new thing and that hes incorporating new stuff into his banner i dont know we have no idea about the history of his banner is your argument this is a new banner so thats evidence against the idea that his eye has always been red would you similarly argue that aegon ii having a new banner with a golden dragon is evidence that he didnt have a golden dragon for long before this i dont really follow the logic
asoiaf,not_removed,probably renly depending when it takes place
asoiaf,not_removed,moonboy for all i know
asoiaf,not_removed,well currently i guess its the high sparrow considering his popularity amongst the commoners
asoiaf,not_removed,my take is this the pro establishment ruthless wife of a former ruler cersai hillary would take out the populist high sparrow bernie only to be double crossed by her socially liberal business ouriented shill little finger trump i think the entire series has be prophetic of our the usas current political struggle excuse me as i chew on some tinfoil
asoiaf,not_removed,well in the show youve got pretty shit choices that said i think lf takes it cersei responsible for the westeros equivalent of would be like electing osama bin laden dany head of a coalition of foreigners rapists and pillagers unsullied dothraki iron born and bad poosy daughter of the westeros equivalent of hitler head advisor is the imp who everyone hates maybe gets some points from a tyrell endorsement and being a conqueror euron ironborn would be like electing fitty cent or something jon bastard son of a guy widely acknowledged to be a traitor betrayed his sacred vows let in a shitload of wildlings compared to the ones above maybe the lesser of all evils option since he is at least a war hero though i guess dany is a conqueror as well so maybe they cancel eachother out littlefinger he takes it has that whole horatio alger thing going on in theory should best be able to sympathize with the plight of the small folk rose to the top from nothing knows how gov works will say whatever to get elected etc wildcard would be someone from the sparrows movement if the hs has some kind of ideological and charismatic heir that person would probably take it though they might have a hard time getting the vote of the holly rhollors and the og worshippers
asoiaf,not_removed,hitler didnt want to blow up his own third reich
asoiaf,not_removed,ramsay surprises his audience welp rickon is kill
asoiaf,not_removed,brienne gwendoline christie meets a friend turned foe oh
asoiaf,not_removed,ramsay iwan rheon surprises his audience i guess the flayed bodies will be revealed dany emilia clarke is true to her word by the grace of the olds gods an the new is she finally sailing to westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,sansa sophie tuner takes control im probably looking forward to this more than the actual battle brienne gwendoline christie meets a friend turned foe could it be the the hangwoman mother merciless herself euron pilou asbæk reveals himself he does that in the books as well when hes speaking to victarion in lord hewetts castle on one of the shield islands more penis confirmed i guess
asoiaf,not_removed,a queen comes forth queen in the north
asoiaf,not_removed,the nights watch gathers i bet all i have that the wall is coming down and the last sworn brothers of the nw shall live and die at their post
asoiaf,not_removed,brienne gwendoline christie meets a friend turned foe they know what theyre doing
asoiaf,not_removed,not to burst any bubbles but i think these synopses are probably fake they were posted on the imdb boards by a guy whose credibility is sketchy at best and no one can find a source for them they dont seem to be from sky germany
asoiaf,not_removed,the wall is coming down in i have no doubts as of now
asoiaf,not_removed,oh fuck get hype
asoiaf,not_removed,euron pilou asbæk reveals himself eurio confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,the nights watch gathers some wall is going down
asoiaf,not_removed,i want the bastardbowl to just be the bastardbowl i dont want any other storylines in that episode sorry dany but you should be true to your word in some other episode
asoiaf,not_removed,oh god they are really playing off of the lsh hype that has to be on purpose
asoiaf,not_removed,seems like a hell of an end for the season arya is not alone i wonder what this means shes not alone is someone going to help her sansa takes control a queen comes forth seems like sansa as the queen in the north is really happening ramsay surprises his audience this has to mean the flayings right all the characters already know about roose being dead so its probably going to be rickon brienne meets a friend turned foe i dont want to get hyped and disappointed again but it really cant be anyone other than jaime or stoneheart right kings landing awaits justice the trial cleganebowl i must be one of the few that actually dont want cleganebowl and i really dont think its happening in the books but it seems like it could really happen in the show the nights watch gathers winter has come the wall is coming down poor edd
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks for sharing im feeling very good about lsh being revealed in the last episode walder frey reminding us about cat being killed by having her throat slit the same scene letting us put easilyrecognizable faces to the people who killed cat robb and other stark loyalists people who are going to the riverlands the brotherhood without banners were noted to be active in the riverlands the casting call for a brotherhood without banners member whos numb to the horror her serves and the knowledge that there will be a hanging scene involving thoros jaime and brienne and also going to the riverlands where the brotherhood is active bringing together multiple characters who have interacted with lsh in the books freys brienne jaime podrick and now brienne gwendoline christie meets a friend turned foe i dismissed previous rumblings that lsh might appear in previous seasons because the show doesnt work like that if theyre going to introduce a character whos been gone for a while theyll start setting the groundwork a couple of episodes earlier for example benjen was brought up at the end of last season to trick jon and he appeared in flashbacks in the current season but thats what theyre doing now with lsh ill bet that in the next episode when the freys are threatening edmure with a knife as we saw in the preview theyll loudly remind the blackfish and the audience that they slit cats throat in the same way otherwise why not threaten to hang him like they did in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,so i guess episode is not set in one location this time
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion finds cause for concern released viserion and rhaegal finally figured out how to get out of their hollow pryamiddungeon
asoiaf,not_removed,brienne gwendoline christie meets a friend turned foe ive been getting up and dancing in my room off and on to shake off the excitement for the last minutes wow i need a life
asoiaf,not_removed,euron pilou asbæk reveals himself euron dario confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,im surprised i assumed given how much they hyped this battle up and how long it took to film that it would be a full episode akin to watchers on the wall or blackwater even the name bore that out unless puts tinfoil hat on dany is the ptwp so her being true to her word is her arriving in the north at the battle and fighting with jon who she later marries and becomes nissa nissa to or something dany in westeros get hype
asoiaf,not_removed,my bets are on following dany is angry with tyrion claims she will kick him out if x happens cercei prepares for the trial sansa is not leading the charge to winterfell arya finds septan maribald and hound ramsay surprises his audience probably some other ugly dd fetish about ramsay he kills someone close to him he wont be flaying rickon as it is clearly expected by everyone jon makes an attack on ramsay fails miserably x happens and danny exiles tyrion a queen comes forth is about the play queen arriving at twins for a play euron reveals that dario is his man all along darios subsequent betrayal of dany completes prophecy brienne faces off against jaime kings landing trial happening nights watch gathers to decide plan of action as the wall goes down
asoiaf,not_removed,a queen comes forth sansa perhaps out of the ashes of the battle as a victor
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess its fake then op deleted the post and account
asoiaf,not_removed,i really dont get the appeal and popularity of lsh shes such a cartoony failure of a character
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt episode supposed to be all the battle why is dany appearing here
asoiaf,not_removed,euron pilou asbæk reveals himself euron benjen confirmed benjen beyond the wall is a faceless man
asoiaf,not_removed,actually ramsay surprising anyone means rickon will not be tortured
asoiaf,not_removed,ramsay azor ahai rickon is nissa nissa comfirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,it has to be unless theyre talking about jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,fellow hypers bran has warged into me from the future to say this do not trust them once more there will be no lsh it will only bring hopelessness and heartbreak
asoiaf,not_removed,shit
asoiaf,not_removed,wait are you guys thinking this means lsh in the books they were not foes no it reads to me like its jaime the plot was headed that way
asoiaf,not_removed,shit
asoiaf,not_removed,ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
asoiaf,not_removed,all aboad the hypeexpress to hypethatville choochooooo
asoiaf,not_removed,lsh
asoiaf,not_removed,unless its just her ancient promise to the masters in yunkai to kill them all if they didnt submit lemme swoop by on this bigass dragon n burn the shit out of everything real quickstyle
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess the flayed bodies will be revealed or he has a change of heart and repents maybe hes sick of all the flaying s by the grace of the olds gods an the new is she finally sailing to westeros more likely dany actually gets a boat rather than just talking about it
asoiaf,not_removed,ramsey startles rickon whilst playing hideandgoskinless dany gets on a bicycle in front of her bloodriders breaks a wheel rousing speech much happy rabble credits
asoiaf,not_removed,im feeling mother merciless and nights watch in wall down and ramsey supriseswith a flayed rickon jon gonna retaliate that shit
asoiaf,not_removed,brienne gwendoline christie meets a friend turned foe jaime brienne are on opposite sides regarding the blackfish with brienne sworn to sansa so id dial down the revenant of revenge hype
asoiaf,not_removed,reveals himself as what thats sort of odd i cant think of a legitimate euron theory that isnt ridiculous that hed reveal any big secret as its either that or jaime i cant think of who else itd be for brienne i mean
asoiaf,not_removed,or dany sails to westeros cersei has a trial both more likely and asha and margaery could do something
asoiaf,not_removed,yeaaaahhhh thats my fear as well lets hope its a last stand against white walkers and not the wall coming down
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope edd wears a hat
asoiaf,not_removed,they know exactly what they are doing
asoiaf,not_removed,i never got them from imbd i just checked and couldnt find a thread there either i got it from here and other websites reporting it

asoiaf,not_removed,where did you get this eurjen confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,hardhome was perfect and it wasnt the only storyline in its episode
asoiaf,not_removed,every year bryan cogman says can we do lsh please please please please and they say you can do the ep synopses
asoiaf,not_removed,fellow hypers bran has warged into me from the future to say this do not trust them once more there will be no lsh it will only bring hopelessness and heartbreak
asoiaf,not_removed,no theres behind the scenes stuff showing danys crew with episode clapperboards so this confirms it it might be like hardhome or maybe one dany scene and the rest the bastardbowl
asoiaf,not_removed,prepare yourself for a new where are my dragons moment
asoiaf,not_removed,they ran out of wine and missendei gets tired of his bullshit
asoiaf,not_removed,or he hears news about his queen coming with dothraki horde to mereen
asoiaf,not_removed,unless arya is no longer in braavos
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,battle of fire at the same time as the battle of the bastards maybe so the episode is all battle but cutting between two locations
asoiaf,not_removed,there is no confirmation it is an all battle episode like boackwater and watchers on the wall blackwater worked and wotw not so much so imo they could do either one is not really better than the other
asoiaf,not_removed,not all battle probably more like hardhome
asoiaf,not_removed,my moneys on hot pie
asoiaf,not_removed,if it isnt then it will be the third time theyve trolled us
asoiaf,not_removed,wouldnt the timing be off for that i feel like if shes going to encounter jaime it will be in one of the next two episodes
asoiaf,not_removed,i have been thinking that blackfish will replace lsh but brienne never met him but jaime is likely
asoiaf,not_removed,there is no way its sandor friend turned foe would that not mean they were friends before i wouldnt call sandor and brienne friends like at all it is most likely to be jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,i think theyre going to merge sansa and lsh hype
asoiaf,not_removed,they were not foes yeah i love it when my friends hang me from a tree until i agree to help lure my other friends to their deaths
asoiaf,not_removed,well i hope it literaally is real quick burn burn sayonaraaaa harpy bitches
asoiaf,not_removed,masters hey we had seven years a deals a deal
asoiaf,not_removed,the high sparrow good word reached the north at last and moved ramsays gentle heart sweet sexy jesus i can´t choose a plot to be the most excited about also cersei dies
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont care if she hops on a fucking dolphin and swims to kl just gtfo meeren it has been too long
asoiaf,not_removed,nah ramsays gonna reveal himself as azor ahai and jon will be pissed because he wanted to be azor ahai
asoiaf,not_removed,jon then he has a meeting with his im surprised theyll be able to fit dany into that episode
asoiaf,not_removed,in the preview jaime is in the riverlands next week briennie is already going there unless it takes more episodes for her to get there im betting that theyre meeting next week
asoiaf,not_removed,i was making a joke about euron calling victarion to a private meeting and having his tackle hanging out til vic tells him to put it away im guessing he maybe reveals himself to the kingdoms attacking the reach or the westerlands perhaps or he reveals he has a dragonbinder horn or some other crazy valyrian magic doodads or euron really is daario and hell pull off his mask and propose to dany
asoiaf,not_removed,reveals himself as in goes naked probably lol got loves play on words like that
asoiaf,not_removed,the harpy
asoiaf,not_removed,or the night queen enters the game insert quarter to continue
asoiaf,not_removed,i think that was dany is true to her word
asoiaf,not_removed,the episode synopses arent on there only the rumored titles heres the im referring to note how the guys post history consists of a fakey leaked got clip which he said came from a spanish forum but wouldnt provide a definitive source or the name of the forum when asked
asoiaf,not_removed,and that director returns for and
asoiaf,not_removed,my head says youre telling the truthbut my heart says get fucking hype
asoiaf,not_removed,yup heres the link for those who are interested it comes from the journey to spain video
asoiaf,not_removed,he will poison her with a direwolf cookie lady brienne was poisoned by our enemies it is known
asoiaf,not_removed,stone heart confirmed for final episode of season
asoiaf,not_removed,now who else in the books treats with brienne as if shes an enemy although they were friends before mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah the reference was lsh
asoiaf,not_removed,thats possible but then this wouldnt be about sansa since she seems to be in the north and wont be taking and lsh role in the riverlands quite that quick since she doesnt really have support in the riverlands besides possibly the blackfish whose tied up i honestly see a lot going for an actual lsh reveal theyve brought back way too much for them to not be doing something relevant with it freys pointing out specific frays edmure blackfish riverlands riverrun all brought back bwb brought back melisandre mentioning beric and thoros
asoiaf,not_removed,i think they are going to merge sansa and alys karstark
asoiaf,not_removed,why because he saw cats throat being sliced he also saw ned and robb
asoiaf,not_removed,technicalities maybe time to reread the books
asoiaf,not_removed,shell just say something cheesy she only needs min to hit maximum cheese
asoiaf,not_removed,something so unimportant would not be mentioned in a summary
asoiaf,not_removed,and theres a dragonhead in that video too so definitely some type of battle in meereen going on
asoiaf,not_removed,hot pie direwolf cookies and direwolf left is there a connection is hotpie the prophet that was promised
asoiaf,not_removed,thats what i was thinking didnt think they would hold off jaime and brienne until ep so it has to be her
asoiaf,not_removed,lsh could be pretty neat actually dunno how they are gonna twist that into it we havent heard anything about them only namedropping once in a while would be a welcome surprise
asoiaf,not_removed,how apart from marrying and giving potential karstark support what alys really did sansa already arrived with a horse to the wall and all
asoiaf,not_removed,he is he was born amidst the smoke of some sweet pie baking and something salty
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry no spoilers is not the correct spoiler scope for your post you discussed season spoilers as well as adwd spoilers please repost this using spoilers extended thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,the faith was reenacted in season by cercei tommen merely deals with the consequences of his delusional mothers actions and tries to keep the realm together the deal he made with the high sparrow was necessary to prevent civil war kevan admits in book epilogue he says something like we cant afford to antagonize the faith now i believe the book was going to follow a similar direction though not as radically in favor of the faith because margaerys charges were quite slim compared to show margaery and because book loras is not in custody but with kevan dead i wonder whats going to happen i really hope tommen keeps his cats and doesnt pay the bill for his brothermothergrandfathers atrocities but this story cant have a happy ending for everyone
asoiaf,not_removed,well cersei last season did a better job portraying all that i dont know what cersei this season is about though shes supposed to be paranoid and convinced even tommen is trying to kill her unlike a lot of people i dont get a sense of undying love and devotion for tommen shes definitely cool toward him unless shes trying to manipulate him and her relationship with jaime is just weird lena said something about how twisted and juicy their relationship is this year im not sure what she was on about its pretty boring and uninteresting really same ol same ol regardless if theyre trying to convey a sense of paranoia and crazinesstheyre not doing a good job
asoiaf,not_removed,wasnt cersei in a scene in season episode or also talking about the debt part to the high sparrow
asoiaf,not_removed,no she talked about helping him find sinners
asoiaf,not_removed,euron doesnt know what hes walking into and honesty i can see yara having an easier time dealing with her
asoiaf,not_removed,yara could swear fealty to her give her her fleet in return for a promise to rule the iron islands at which point its greyjoybowl get hype
asoiaf,not_removed,yara is a bit more practical than euron or balon i can see her doing this
asoiaf,not_removed,thats an interesting take ive heard the interpretation that the sun rises in the west and sets in the east was a reference to quentyn martell but never the wildfire explosion in kl personally im partial to the theory that mirri was just being a dickhead and using flowery language to say never and there are some solid hints that cersei is going to set fire to kl
asoiaf,not_removed,confirmed doesnt mean what it used to
asoiaf,not_removed,also the backstory of hardhome destruction several years ago there was a nice post explaining how it is linked to an asteroid impact is an example where people take a large fireexplosion as a sunrise so there is enough potential and precedence in asoiaf to actually have a sun rises in the west situation its more difficult to complete the picture with a sets in the east scenario though
asoiaf,not_removed,the destruction of years before aegons landing was described by the men of the nights watch as the sun rising in the north hardhome was destroyed in a fiery incident just a fun fact edit someone already posted about it
asoiaf,not_removed,dany doesnt even have to be the one burning them all even if shes on her way to westeros when it happened kings landing would still be in the west anyway problem is the sun setting in the east though
asoiaf,not_removed,however it gets set off i think we can all agree that theyre not showing the wildfire for no reason and kings landing is gonna get blown to hell
asoiaf,not_removed,im leaning towards cersei blowing up kings landing but this works too
asoiaf,not_removed,dany will not burn anything in kl because there will be nothing left to be burned there when she arrives people insist its dany burning kl when its cersei who knows about the wildfire and its cersei who has said countless time shed burn the city to the ground
asoiaf,not_removed,a fire in the west would seem like a rising sun but the sun wouldnt set in the east though itd just fade in the west
asoiaf,not_removed,i like thanks this is good so the rest of the prophecy goes when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves when your womb quickens again and you bear a living child then he will return and not before maybe a massive earthquake a la hammer of the waters to make new seas form and mountains topple if the wall comes down that would be a pretty big seismic shock maybe even new continentsessos and westeros linked againok will stop here
asoiaf,not_removed,i like the notion although didnt tyrion dig up most of the wildfire caches to set the blackwater ablaze didnt he says something like wed never have been able to make enough on our own without finding these huge caches lying all around the city
asoiaf,not_removed,this fits perfectly with all of my personal theories nice job and thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,the sun rising in the west could also represent the faith rising in kings landing
asoiaf,not_removed,ive always been partial to the sun setting in the east being quentyn so i like this part of it a lot nice idea
asoiaf,not_removed,we also saw the drogon vision in brans flashbacks in the episode
asoiaf,not_removed,this could then lead to danys ashen throne room dream
asoiaf,not_removed,lets not forget the vision dany has in the house of the undying where she is walking through the throne room and it appears to be in total ashes
asoiaf,not_removed,for this to make sense dany will have to be to the east of kings landing watching the fake sunrise in the west this will place her somewhere around pentos or perhaps dragonstone or something take from that what you want
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think this prophecy will ever come true i dont think dany was ever barren i dont think drogo in any form will ever return but i think you can make an argument that it has or will be satisfied yes
asoiaf,not_removed,but how will it set in the east demolishing hightower
asoiaf,not_removed,with the new euron chapter it is looking like he will sit the iron throne im predicting a harren the black situation revisited with wildfire at kl
asoiaf,not_removed,fun catch but i think your reading to much into it bran had all these visions of fire and destruction he wakes up and in enters benjen with a magic flame flail of ice zombie destruction i think the crash course was a course in other ice zombie destruction but of cause that would make the tree eyed raven a good guy and preston would not like that so maybe your right
asoiaf,not_removed,setting in the west it always does that
asoiaf,not_removed,what if daenerys riding west on drogon from her perspective will have the sun rising in the west and setting in the east
asoiaf,not_removed,well we know that grrm likes to use httpsenwikipediaorgwikihalifaxexplosion as a basis for asoiaf plot lines
asoiaf,not_removed,sigh picks up dunk and egg for yet another reread nice work
asoiaf,not_removed,when the mountains blow in the wind like leaves if you were viewing the mountains through the extreme heat of a fire they might appear to be wavy
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont get it this prophecy is not about danny winning or anything is not about her great apotheotic moment is about when will khal drogo come back to me for drogo to come back to daenerys one of two things have to happen either he ressurects or daenerys dies and they are reunited in the afterlife much better if mirri maz dur was just saying never
asoiaf,not_removed,there was a forest fire mentioned in the forsaken aeron chapter that grrm read at a recent balticon maybe a forest fire has just been foreshadowed again
asoiaf,not_removed,doesnt the sun already set in the west
asoiaf,not_removed,the sun setting would be when a drogo or a dragon fall upon or at eastwatch castle black could be the arrival or death of one or all of them sidebar if she does have a kid spinoff pretty please but whats west of westeros western civilization the fleeing of englands reign where the magic went bummer note i always thought jon would have to pierce the heart of danny to forge the lightbringer thus no kids unless lightbringer is actually code for his penis and hes going to stab danny with it ah yes there is light at the end of the tunnel
asoiaf,not_removed,the sigil of house tarth caught my eye with this quote it could interpreted as the the sunrising in the east and setting in the west brienne could very well have a large part to play with dany
asoiaf,not_removed,drogon sets fire to kings landing as it is overrun by wights burning them all afterwards dany is queen of a barren kings landing as per her vision when she visited khal drogo in the tent
asoiaf,not_removed,and the others will come to bring winter and stop the wildfire
asoiaf,not_removed,yes thats how i always interpreted it as dany being barren after a complicated birth and mirri using a long winded way to say that
asoiaf,not_removed,i imagine this could work out sorta like
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei tries to burn them all jamie kills her to stop it then dany comes in and burns them all
asoiaf,not_removed,personally im partial to the theory that mirri was just being a dickhead and using flowery language to say never it can be both
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry to seem dense but what are the solid hints
asoiaf,not_removed,theres only one thing thats confirmed and its fucking confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,we already ruined literally so why not confirmed too
asoiaf,not_removed,for sure
asoiaf,not_removed,sets in the east could refer to light returning to asshai beyond the shadow i have no idea its a stab in the dark but it could work
asoiaf,not_removed,could explain why the red keep in her vision looks like
asoiaf,not_removed,kings landing is on the east coast of westeros though if dany were to cause the destruction it would not appear as a sunrise to her however if she were sailing across the narrow sea and cersei destroys kings landing with the wildfire it could very well appear as a western sunrise from danys pov on the sea
asoiaf,not_removed,i kinda took that to mean the dawn or something when light returns it will come from east and i tok the whole thing to mean when she dies but i like the idea of shes never gonna see it when hell freezes i also think o the show and wonder how that fits was it death on the other side of the wall dead rise thats what the itch meant dead will rise not necc drogo
asoiaf,not_removed,seas would be dry if they froze right urhoynestar and if winter comes should be great winds in winter haha who knows what that will do but the womb thing sadly fits my hated theory that heads is jon and dany and child but then the dead rise amazing to think she could meet jon and have a kid before the war started and the dead rise but my thought was witch meant dead are coming death is coming which is what dd call the ww death second thought was her death thats what the witch alsoandor meant in the show we also see a tentwith death on the other side of the wall of her husband and baby also a husband and a child jon and new kid and finally her own death and darkness comes light will set in the east complete well see
asoiaf,not_removed,but they kept turning up more and more the implication is they dont know how much is there or even where it was hidden
asoiaf,not_removed,i always thought that part of the prophecy referred to quentyn martell the sun in the family sigil he was raised in westeros and died in essos
asoiaf,not_removed,brienne is related to ser duncan
asoiaf,not_removed,which becomes ironic as dany fulfills each of those poetic conditions
asoiaf,not_removed,she is increasingly erratic and paranoid of everyone around her and she seemed almost hypbotised looking at the wildfire burning the tower of the hand
asoiaf,not_removed,airhorns sirens
asoiaf,not_removed,fucking confirmed new confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,i literally agree with you no wait
asoiaf,not_removed,sets in the east could be a total eclipse of the sun by the moon in the morning i wonder whether the long night will create some strange sun rise sunset phenomena too
asoiaf,not_removed,congratulations on becoming queen of the ashes
asoiaf,not_removed,or if dany was on dragonstone it might appear to be roughly in the west
asoiaf,not_removed,ahhh true all of the pyromancers from that era died and the extent of the secret caches were really only known by rossart and maybe the mad king thatd be an interesting reversal if somehow jamie had a hand in igniting them that kind of reversal would be very grrm or as you say if dany trying so hard not to become the mad king fulfills his greatest and sickest wish without even meaning to
asoiaf,not_removed,ugh i suppose but it feels like a copout because it was such a minor event in the grand scheme of things dany didnt even get to see it happen by that token you could also say that the sun has already risen in the west because thats why quentyn started his journey
asoiaf,not_removed,which would work with the idea that miri accidentally hatched the dragon eggs with her blood magic
asoiaf,not_removed,unsheathes lightsaber broad sword
asoiaf,not_removed,the hype remembers
asoiaf,not_removed,rise in the west sets in the east couldnt that mean that dany dragons go west and are not in the east anymore
asoiaf,not_removed,great another fucking title
asoiaf,not_removed,hello lord varys
asoiaf,not_removed,harrenhall
asoiaf,not_removed,i love you guys
asoiaf,not_removed,no time for love only hype
asoiaf,not_removed,yes she stripped to her waist and then opened up her chest of potions and stuff probably to avoid getting blood on her clothes
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks gents i feel silly now
asoiaf,not_removed,yep op was confused about carved chest i think she was opening a literal chest like a box
asoiaf,not_removed,a box like you mean ber vagina
asoiaf,not_removed,to become a god and rebuild the world or just rebuild the world bran the rebuilder
asoiaf,not_removed,he definitely is bran the builder
asoiaf,not_removed,what other bran would have the knowledge to help build storms end at a childs age
asoiaf,not_removed,oh no brandon the builder theory is back it is one of the most annoying theories i have read just use a secret name for bran questions like what do you think the end game will be for that tree that is with the crocodile in westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,to ally with the others and get at the end
asoiaf,not_removed,im hoping for bran the breaker though he could also be the crippled king edit or the king who stood
asoiaf,not_removed,or live for hundreds of years unless its just tree bran dipping in and out of the time continuum
asoiaf,not_removed,lol remember when his deadline was this time last year
asoiaf,not_removed,he is probably shooting to release before next season he wont though
asoiaf,not_removed,i honestly dont know and dont get what is going on i get that he is a slow writer he has a busy schedule and that he may be having troubles ending this huge complicated story but last year he though he would finish by the end of oct then when that didnt happen he thought he might squeeze it in by the end of the year but we are now almost a full year later and not a word since i just dont get how he could have thought he was close enough to say that he would be done by then yet obviously not after all the times of him refusing to give estimates and saying it will be done when its done for him to finally give a hint and glimmer of an end just to be so wrong it just doesnt add up
asoiaf,not_removed,back in may grrm said at balticon that he was still working on it and that he had a ways to go nothing that grrm has said on the subject since then makes me all that optimistic that grrm is close to completing the book when grrm returned from the emmys he indicated that he was getting back to work which is great and all but still the book isnt finished now will it be finished by the end of the year probably not but who knows on a more optimistic side as ive said previously its always possible that if grrm is nearing his magical manuscript page mark his editors and publishers might tell grrm to wrap up writing for the book as the book becomes too large to bind if the book extends much beyond manuscript page mark still who knows but i personally think that an announcement at the end of the year is unlikely
asoiaf,not_removed,if were lucky
asoiaf,not_removed,years ago i honestly thought would be the year and was downvoted in threads for saying so i think there was hype then that it was coming in summer iirc cant believe were already at the end of if it doesnt come out i have a feeling it may never
asoiaf,not_removed,whats worse imagine that by some miracle he publishes twow before hell freezes over now imagine a month or two after that when the wait for ados begins
asoiaf,not_removed,end of is my guess
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think we get an announcement until the middle of next year i could see an announcement coming on the season premier of game thrones bc thats likely pushed into summer now so i could probably see it actually getting released in time for christmas octobernovember maybe
asoiaf,not_removed,when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves seriously though forgot about it coming out in
asoiaf,not_removed,certainly not within the next two years
asoiaf,not_removed,it will come out at the most problematic time for me to get time off of work to read it
asoiaf,not_removed,hell make a blog post in january saying that he didnt get nearly as much writing done as he had hoped and has no timeline for finishing
asoiaf,not_removed,march if the writing goes well
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,im such the negative type person irl that i need to balance it somehow so i always say next month
asoiaf,not_removed,my prediction is this it will come out june but then it will get delayed to november
asoiaf,not_removed,at this point i honestly think the show will end before the next book comes out or he will die and it will never come out he is old and fat and finally world renowned famous not good factors for productivity interest in the books will fall dramatically after the show ends as many people will be satisfied enough with how it turns out this will lead to disappointing sales of winds and worse for spring grrm will be butt hurt about not finishing the books before the series and take even longer to finish the books in the meantime releasing more world building material instead of just writing the damn books we want to read my
asoiaf,not_removed,its out next week surprise
asoiaf,not_removed,when the show concludes in summer of grrm will be able to sit down and write so i suspect the book will be out early
asoiaf,not_removed,i lost faith in the books coming out anytime soon when george attempted but failed to release the novel before season but if i had to guess i would assume sometime next year in
asoiaf,not_removed,he thought he could finish it last year so im not that pessimistic about the release date i dont think it will be released in but i think its very likely to be released in maybe not before season but at some point in is my prediction if it is not released before the show i would call a winter release
asoiaf,not_removed,never
asoiaf,not_removed,at this point id consider ourselves lucky to have it before the final season of the show
asoiaf,not_removed,oooo i member
asoiaf,not_removed,this it just doesnt make sense or rather we dont really have enough information now that hes gone tight lipped to make a good prediction
asoiaf,not_removed,didnt he mention that he was writing a storyline saw where it was going didnt like scrapped the whole thing and started over
asoiaf,not_removed,must you keep talking about yourself in the third person
asoiaf,not_removed,living up to your flair i see
asoiaf,not_removed,do you think there will be books in the series
asoiaf,not_removed,i expect completion before march assuming his estimate of remaining pages in and his adwd pace see math and tables in are there any other more recent statements that should be used as updated assumptions notably adwd was published in the us on july which was days after affc if the same interval occurs for twow the publication date would be april
asoiaf,not_removed,mayhaps
asoiaf,not_removed,i know what you mean
asoiaf,not_removed,member when there were less mexicans
asoiaf,not_removed,why downvote it was a joke
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm and his editors have been saying that the series will end at books for over years now as recently as earlier this month grrms editor stated that itll be books i think is the number for the moment given that grrm has been working on twow for years and soley writing for twow for the past years youd think he has a pretty good idea of where he is at this juncture and how much space he has to cover in the remainder of twow and ados on the other hand remember that grrm basically has a manuscript page limit for a final manuscript for adwd his editor stated that had he finished where he wanted to finish for the book the book could not have been bound in a single volume so he cut manuscript pages and pushed unfinished sequences s the battles of winterfell and meereen to twow if hes at a similar juncture for twow where hes pushing material back to ados its possible he might face something similar for ados so id say for the moment but isnt out of the question
asoiaf,not_removed,but there was no show then i think is publicity and related work increased by since the release of the show
asoiaf,not_removed,member chewbacca
asoiaf,not_removed,is that just pr from the editor though i remember she said something like if hed written those battles hed still be writing a year later my impression is that the publisher just snapped and forced him to publish what he had am i the only one who doesnt care if the book comes out in two volumes my copies of asos and adwd are in two volumes and every tv show ever doesnt fit all on the one dvd whats the big deal
asoiaf,not_removed,though his editor has also given us reason to believe at least as recently as that there could well be eight books in the end
asoiaf,not_removed,so just a question when it comes to the cant be bound in a single volume stuff cant they make it larger and so need less pages you know like textbooks and handbooks do
asoiaf,not_removed,member the
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the question is more how far apart in publication would those two volumes be feast and dance were supposed to be a year apart but we know how that ended up
asoiaf,not_removed,from the earlier comment by ugrodybrody is that just pr from the editor though i remember she said something like if hed written those battles hed still be writing a year later my impression is that the publisher just snapped and forced him to publish what he had
asoiaf,not_removed,yea but member the though
asoiaf,not_removed,but theyre two separate books not two separate volumes the volumes of asos and adwd where they were published as such came out simultaneously
asoiaf,not_removed,member tatooine
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry i misunderstood you in that case maybe theyre worried about print pricing storage pricing and maybe even sales two shorter books would probably be more expensive than one longer especially hardcover
asoiaf,not_removed,member the titans
asoiaf,not_removed,i was about to prove you wrong but i checked and asos pt is about the same price as agot in other words they would charge twice as much im sure that putting it out in two volumes isnt twice as expensive the fact is they can charge whatever they want for these books and people will pay it thats why theyre putting it out in hardcover first after all now i happen to know that if they felt like it they could package both volumes together wrapped in plastic again this would be more expensive for them althoygh probably not twice as much point being its possible that these books could be released in multiple volumes at any manuscript length and theyd sell so unless the publishers are married to the idea of a single volume and as businessmen why would they be i think its fair to say that they just snapped in and demanded he published what he had probably

asoiaf,not_removed,hi thanks for your post and welcome to rasoiaf unfortunately your title is a bit messed up as you can see spoiler code does not work in titles please repost this with the following title question about nymeria
asoiaf,not_removed,no just no he will put parallels to current events if it fits the story not fit them into his story just because they happen
asoiaf,not_removed,because of the lunacy of the two presidential candidates hillary cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,hi this post has been removed per our rule sketchiness while its an interesting analogy and theory its also very politically charged regarding the upcoming us election on some points and liable to cause slapfighting and dbad violations cheers
asoiaf,not_removed,possible but i doubt it as the ending was planned out long in advance its getting there he seems to have problems with
asoiaf,not_removed,americas future is anything but uncertain
asoiaf,not_removed,hahahahahahahah
asoiaf,not_removed,so you want robb to break his vows and then take hostages yeah im sure every house will be dying to offer their daughter to him after that
asoiaf,not_removed,walder swallowing his pride in order to save his heir like he swallowed his pride to save his wife ultimately the frey marriage was a bad deal just because you agree to a bad deal doesnt mean you get to renege on it or renegotiate the terms of it whenever you want without any consequences i took a workshop with a negotiation specialist once who had worked on some sensitive and difficult international agreements and one thing she specified is that when you go into a negotiation you need to know whether you a dealing with an honor culture or a dignity culture in an honor culture people dont have a basic trust in their own personal safety they do not believe the government or the law can or will protect them and they have to carry out a degree of that protection themselves so they prioritize keeping their word and not looking weak in an honor culture keeping your word and only dealing with people who also keep their word is a deterrent against someone taking advantage of you someone in an honor culture will often give up financial value in order to secure other value especially as it relates to reputation or safety large and lucrative deals will often fall apart if one of the parties feels insulted or disrespected by the other party but this mutual suspicion doesnt prevent deals from happening once an agreement is sealed if both parties adhere to custom and respect it can hold very well this is what ned stark got out of his honor he was able to rule and govern the north even though he absolutely did not have the force of arms to do so because he observed and exemplified mutually reinforced honor customs and because nobody in the north is quite safe enough to afford to disregard these customs and because mutually observing the customs also helps other northerners protect themselves so they are glad to have a leader who demonstrates they are important and get very worried to the point of sedition if they have a leader who does not support the customs once you get to the kings landing this isnt so much the case a lot of the higher nobility in other parts of westeros consider themselves pretty much untouchable so they dont understand or participate in honor culture the way ned does and his mutual deterrent breaks down in a dignity culture people have a basic trust that their safety is accounted for and they see negotiations as separate from their worth or existence as human beings someone from a dignity culture who is after a specific financial outcome might not even care if their life is threatened or they are insulted as long as they get a better slice of the pie for it people in dignity cultures tend to see breaking agreements or custom or respect as more proportional you would not give up a big gain for a small slight but also if a deal isnt going your way you may call it off suddenly or try to otherwise adjust the situation trying to get things to go your way a little more to an extent walder frey seems like he might be from an honor culture and he kills robb because he is insulted and feels he must react this way to being so flagrantly disrespected or he might be from a dignity culture feeling so safe and secure at the twins and in his neutrality that he can play the subtleties of politics without much consideration for his reputation as long as he is securing other advantages from it regardless robb starks problem isnt just walder freys culture its that robb is from an honor culture so robb is willing to go to edmures wedding accept guest right and think he is safe in much the same way as ned stark sends portions of his household guard to bring the mountain to the kings justice without fully realizing that he is putting himself in further danger by doing it because in the north he would generally be safe doing it the wildlings are enough of a threat to everyone in the north that you dont backstab the stark of winterfell when he sallies forth to drive them away for the sake of your own safety this is what happens to rodrik cassel in a clash of kings he makes a bunch of decisions gathering a force to march off and retake torrhens square going to meet the boltons with his guard down to assume they will help retake winterfell for the starks due to their vows of allegiance that make sense if he is dealing with northerners who obey honor and custom but because he is dealing with ironborn and honorless ramsay snow he gets killed for it if robb wanted to go around breaking deals willy nilly looking for any edge he could get with a marriage to a tyrell or a dornishwoman sure he could probably do that but it would require him to change as a person and more importantly it would affect other things he does it would affect his relationship with his men it would affect his ability to govern the north it would require him to be a southerner and for him to draw his power and authority from other southerners and it would also require him to be extremely thorough and extremely cautious and make sure to line up incentives for his friends rivals and enemies appropriately hed have to be littlefinger but hes not littlefinger had george not had his finger on the scales in other ways their wrath would mostly be impotent strongly disagree with this jon runs into the same problem where he decides to forego his honor and his vows in ways that he thinks any reasonable person would understand and in ways that make sense logically but at the end of the day his own power and authority was drawn by institutions that depend on honor culture so without it he had nothing at all and was assassinated the other big issue here is timing yeah a whole lot of things had to happen in a specific way for the red wedding to go down the way it did and if they had happened differently it would not have happened but there still would have been consequences and at the very least still putting aside all this once the greyjoys take deepwood motte and winterfell robb is in big trouble regardless and becomes a not particularly attractive marriage prospect until he gets his situation fixed
asoiaf,not_removed,ultimately the frey marriage was a bad deal the frey marriage was an excellent deal at the time robb was not even a lord just the heir of one the freys not only gave him their military might which was more men than any of his own vassals gave him but allowed him into the riverlands bypassing tywin at the green fork cat negotiated an excellent deal she made walder go against character and ally himself with a rebel at a point when no one knew that the reach and stormlands would rebel freys in terms of potential hostages and of his own men garrisoned in the twins capable of holding the freys to their feudal obligations well it was of each not just northmen had all those northmen remained loyal to robb rather than roose or even the coin of the freys then they would still be outnumbered as the many of the freys had returned home from harrnehal riverrun and the west those would not have been able to hold walder hostage without at the time aggravating some riverlords as at the time the freys had done nothing but serve robb loyally he could have likely held onto the freys by virtue of holding their heir hostage this is just idiotic as the freys are intermarried with quite a few riverland houses why would any other powerful house make a marriage alliance with robb when he not only broke his last one after receiving his dowry in full but is holding the house hostage to get his own way this is aerys ii all over again with jaime being ruthless against your enemies is fine but you dont fuck over your own allies he instantly turns the freys against him as well as other riverland nobles like lord vypren and charlton and maybe even lord harlaw
asoiaf,not_removed,httpiimgurcomvtycpmigif
asoiaf,not_removed,i am going with one mistake he made that is actually based on his own persona and not an imaginary one letting his troops call him king he should have made common cause with stannis as his father had done if robb had penned tywin in at harrenhall the whole war might have ended with the blackwater if he was a totally different person you just bring a lot more troops to the red wedding and seize the castle a bannerman has no right to require anything of his king or overlord
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think the mistake was not marrying a frey he was their liege and he should have been able to cross without any marriage pact the mistake was marrying an irrelevant small house the westerlings a pact with the tyrells martells or greyjoys could have won the war for him
asoiaf,not_removed,even if his garrison in the twins cant seize the two sides the garrison could almost certainly not seize the two sides since house frey was able to field well over in the war and frey didnt lose many until a good bit after the battle of the whispering wood that may not seem like a high number but when you consider that the riverlands as a whole is estimated to be able to raise troops it is rather impressive especially considering how the tullys apparently dont have the power to call all of them to arms due to traditional divisiveness in their bannermen it is a rather dramatic difference robb himself rolled up to the red wedding with only men directly under him that means that he will have to siege the twins in the long term he would win but long before that happens some loyalist army would roll up and smash him to bits against the walls the twins is a really strong castle that cant be taken quickly and robb cant afford to just sit outside with his ass exposed to the enemy while they roll all over the riverlands and the north if walder is willing to throw away the life of his heir he almost certainly would be walders first son and heir the one that he personally groomed was killed early in the war at the battle of oxcross leaving him with stevrons kids walder let caitlin kill one of them jinglebell at the red wedding even saying that he didnt consider grandsons to be equal to sons his new heir is a lackwit who he never really groomed and whom everyone expects to die young literally everyone hates ryman frey even in walders own family he doesnt have much to lose in letting ryman die the late lord might be into the idea that blood is blood but he is still a very cunning man and a tyrant or even secure passage by boat from saltpans or maidenpool at his leisure which means that any time he wants to enter the eastern side of westeros he has to head dangerously close to loyalist territory or march all the way back to the north and take the kingsroad on down in essence any time one of his armies got into a battle the other side would be functionally unable to reinforce them in any reasonable length of time he would also have to find a way to ready a huge fleet in maidenpool the saltpans would never be able to support his army seeking naval transport without getting hit in the ass by the crowns armies or at sea by any number of people or natural disasters the north hasnt sailed in millennia for a reason not to mention the costs where would robb be getting the fleet necessary to do all of this where would he get the money all of these problems come up every time he wants to travel he can just go the long way around that is going all the way to the ruby ford which isnt really a valid tactical decision as i mentioned with maidenpool by then riverrun would have been crushed edmure would be back in lannister hands and robb would be stuck in the south with no support to the north of him
asoiaf,not_removed,robbs mistakes
asoiaf,not_removed,i quite agree with u and attewell writes on robbs mistake as well to quote him more importantly the question of whether robb should have kept his word to walder seems to rest on the mistaken assumption that walder frey was primarily reacting to the insult throughout catelyn ix it is repeatedly remarked on that walder frey is a disloyal man who will not uphold his vows and who cannot be trusted in the slightest as catelyn points out the moment she sees his host drawn up at the twins it was the trident all over damn the man her brother edmure had called the banners by rights lord frey should have gone to join the tully host at riverrun yet here he sat walder freys protestations that he meant to send his swords are patently false given that every other riverlands house made it to riverrun to fight in the battle the fact that ser jared frey the liar swears on his honor that walders intent was good only confirms this likewise his protestation that i swore oaths to the crown too are ultimately hollow and ultimately more directed as setting up a bidding war for his loyalty – edmures call to fight went out almost a month before king robert died and the declaration that the tullys and their bannermen would have to come to kings landing or be attainted couldnt have reached him until after the battles of golden tooth and riverrun which ought to have made him a traitor by association in other words walder frey is blackmailing the starks over something he is by rights obligated to do anyway
asoiaf,not_removed,robs mistake was letting his weiner do the walking and now hes dead
asoiaf,not_removed,i would have agreed before i read the books but now i disagree the show makes the freys out to be some dogshit house far too unimportant for someone like robb and they made it seem like robb probably could have taken the twins himself if he wanted to but he didnt want to lose men and break peace with someone who could be an ally it seems like he really has no business marrying scum like the freys in the books this isnt the case at all its made very clear that there is no way robbs army will pass through the neck without allying with the freys its also made clear that the freys arent just some scummy house but the most powerful house in all the riverlands now consider robbs intentions he wants to secede from the realm and form his own kingdom consisting only of the north and the riverlands next consider the purpose of marriage for a high born it is to consolidate necessary alliances robb is king of the north so he really doesnt need to consolidate any alliances within the north that leaves the riverlands hes already on very good terms with the tullys the liege lord of the riverlands because his mom is catelyn tully the freys are the next most powerful house in all the riverlands and on sketchy terms with the north so a more solid alliance is needed not to mention they hold a very key geographical location which is necessary both in passing down the neck and also guarding the north from southern invaders the show does their best to shit on the freys but honestly there was no better marriage available for robb not to mention that he allows robb his choice of any of a plethora of girls which is far more choice than most lords get marrying margaery or arianne would have helped him take the iron throne to be sure but he doesnt want the iron throne he wants the north he has no reason to betray the freys that was just wrong on his part and when you say crossing the twins is now a non issue how do you expect hell go back up north again he doesnt have enough men inside the twins to take it because that would have been an obvious sign of betrayal from the get go and the frey army is strong men within a strong castle could easily repel the northern army when they tried to come back up north considering that robbs army only had about barring the freys and would have significantly less after winning the war
asoiaf,not_removed,i would agree that robb shouldnt have accepted the feys offer for his hand to a frey girl but i disagree that he should of broken a deal afterwards i say he should have quickly forged a betrothal with one of his northern lords ie manderly umber mormont and etc
asoiaf,not_removed,they should never agreed to marry robb to the freys make edmure manderly rickon bolton marry into them and if they say no then tell them they will die
asoiaf,not_removed,if robb breaks his oath at any point hell still lose the frey levies currently with him
asoiaf,not_removed,and the freys at harrenhal in aryas last acok chapter are planning to break their alliance with robb before they heard he had broken the marriage pact
asoiaf,not_removed,the mad king killed dozens of members of extremely important houses across his kingdom for no reason this would be an action taken against a single house which had demanded an outrageous cost for doing what they were rightfully supposed to do because it was their obligation as bannermen to the tullys a house which no one in particular actually likes and which is considered lesser than essentially all of their peers who only have the power they do because theyre rich
asoiaf,not_removed,like he swallowed his pride to save his wife an heir is worth significantly more than a wife when you have more descendants than you know what to do with honor culture vs dignity culture and not getting to go back on a bad deal i think your own point here undermines the argument that robb couldnt go back on his word because crucially for his reputation in the north robb was dealing with people well known for not keeping their word not because he chose to but because circumstances forced him to talk with people he would otherwise have sneered at atleast this is what he can tell his bannermen and which they are likely to listen to the freys begin the negotiations on bad faith because they have refused to obey their obligations to their lord which undermines their own reputation throughout both the riverlands and the north which is then compounded by bad blood from previous conflicts where walder frey has been slack in fulfilling his social obligations this is important because even in honor cultures its not a simple question of everyone lacking security so everyone is pushed to equally rely on their honor to maintain personal safety there are still differentials of power and respect which lead to people breaking their word with others who arent regarded with respect the variety of culture events take place in doesnt override power politics and image manipulation being effective tools towards a ruler like i think you vastly overestimate the role of jon breaking his vows in his assassination and are ignoring jons failure to build a coalition of people at the wall behind his views hes constantly sending his friends and allies away and is surrounded by his enemies and critics rather than isolating and spreading his enemies far and wide ultimately he trusts too much in the power of an institution and rank to protect himself rather than on actual politics
asoiaf,not_removed,harlaw
asoiaf,not_removed,the frey marriage was an excellent deal at the time robb was not even a lord just the heir of one the freys not only gave him their military might which was more men than any of his own vassals gave him but allowed him into the riverlands bypassing tywin at the green fork cat negotiated an excellent deal she made walder go against character and ally himself with a rebel at a point when no one knew that the reach and stormlands would rebel it was a terrible deal because all of that is stuff theyre already required to do the freys were holding back their support from their liege lord and preventing his liege lords allies from coming to the support of their lord when all you get out of a deal is what you should expect with no questions whatsoever its a bad deal walder frey was breaking character by siding with someone before they were assured victory but thats also pretty good evidence hes a fairweather friend at best and that the alliance didnt have good long term prospects well it was of each not just northmen had all those northmen remained loyal to robb rather than roose or even the coin of the freys then they would still be outnumbered as the many of the freys had returned home from harrnehal riverrun and the west those would not have been able to hold walder hostage without at the time aggravating some riverlords as at the time the freys had done nothing but serve robb loyally which is why this should be planned ahead of time so that the northern half of the garrison is able to get the better of the frey garrison before the frey men return from their various posts after that its a matter of them putting a nearly unsiegeable castle under siege while most of their liege family is held hostage in the twins and as for the opinion of other riverlords theres likely to be disquiet but the freys arent respected by their peers and will not have earned any new friends by holding back their men from edmures cause he will need to deal with the rest of the riverlords more carefully after that point for sure but that doesnt make it unthinkable as an action especially because in otl he allows them to disperse back to their seats anyway early in a clash of kings and considering how them returning home to their seats is just about the worst possible result he can expect for this then he doesnt actually lose much this is just idiotic as the freys are intermarried with quite a few riverland houses why would any other powerful house make a marriage alliance with robb when he not only broke his last one after receiving his dowry in full but is holding the house hostage to get his own way this is aerys ii all over again with jaime return the dowry then he can tell anyone else he negotiates with that the freys were negotiating in bad faith knowing he couldnt say no to anything they put forward and were essentially only offering things they were obliged to do anyway its the truth and the low esteem the freys are held in would play a large part in helping to justify his decision to others and yeah the comparison to aerys falls flat aerys actions were disastrous because he did his damnedest to show he has absolutely no regard for the feudal contract while also leaving the families of his victims alive knowing that there was no possible way for them to operate safely while he was king this is a targeted action against a single house that is unpopular which plays on their image to make the whole action seem more justified
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah calling himself king didnt really make sense if he wants to be king of the north why march out of the north he wants to defeat the lannisters because they killed ned but then what he has no allies no one he intends to give the iron throne to not to mention that he really doesnt have the power to defeat the lannisters but he also has absolutely no endgame had he allied with stannis or even the martells he could have won to ally with stannis hed have to denounce his title as king – but would it really be necessary to be king anyway its just pride since he already called himself king that he dooesnt want to denounce it at this point
asoiaf,not_removed,letting his troops call him king he should have made common cause with stannis as his father had done if robb had penned tywin in at harrenhall the whole war might have ended with the blackwater as he basically says he cant exactly throw that in their faces given how its essentially saying theyve all just committed treason making common cause with stannis relied on stannis reaching out to him in order to convince him of the truth of his claims that jeoffrey is a bastard because then he can renounce his crown while maintaining the respect of his bannermen they declared him king in the north thinking there was no legal way to oppose jeoffrey and before stannis would just be a usurper
asoiaf,not_removed,he was their liege no hoster tully was the liege lord of the freys not robb
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed although i suspect the greyjoy pact was impossible balon had already accepted asha would be his heir sending her off to marry robb would mean he had to accept theon as his heir and it would appear he was already planning to invade the north even before theon was sent to treat with him
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah this was the inspiration for my post
asoiaf,not_removed,make edmure manderly rickon bolton marry into them robb can only make rickon he does not have the power to make the other three do so if they say no then tell them they will die cat already threatened walder and he called her bluff oh do you thats blunt why should i let you for a moment her anger flared if you were strong enough to climb your own battlements lord frey you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside your walls theyll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when lord tywin gets here the old man shot back dont you try and frighten me my lady your husbands in some traitors cell under the red keep your fathers sick might be dying and jaime lannisters got your brother in chains what do you have that i should fear
asoiaf,not_removed,true its probable that he wont be able to retain those men as a fighting force even if he imprisons stevron theyre not going to be exactly loyal after that but that only really establishes the bottom floor of what he should try to gain by breaking this vow in the very least he shouldnt trade away men for less than something equivalent to men
asoiaf,not_removed,no they are not they suggest that king robb for they still acknowledge him as their king should sue for peace after the lannistertyrell alliance someone must have the courage to say it ser hosteen said the war is lost king robb must be made to see that at no point did they suggest breaking their alliance with robb in that chapter before they hear of robbs betrayal
asoiaf,not_removed,the mad king killed dozens of members of extremely important houses across his kingdom for no reason no reason are you sure about that and look what happened to him half the realm turned against him and he was overthrown this would be an action taken against a single house they are not a single house though lord charlton is his vassal lord vypren is his soninlaw and there are other riverland houses connected to him who may have more loyalty to their own blood than they would do to robb an outrageous cost for doing what they were rightfully supposed to do you do realize that robbs own grandfather demanded a marriage alliance to fight in roberts rebellion or that robbs ancestor demanded a marriage pact to fight in the dance of the dragons as did the lord baratheon in the same war a marriage alliance is not an outrageous price cat certainly did not think so
asoiaf,not_removed,a house which no one in particular actually likes and which is considered lesser than essentially all of their peers who only have the power they do because theyre rich you made this up this would be an action taken against a single house which had demanded an outrageous cost for doing what they were rightfully supposed to do because it was their obligation as bannermen to the tullys i dont know how to tell you this but robb stark is not lord tully and how is a marriage an outragous cost
asoiaf,not_removed,doh i meant hawick i knew i should have looked that up hosteen the oldest of the crakehall freys married a hawick considering his younger freycrakehall siblings all married quite well i imagine she was either a sister or daughter of lord hawick the hawicks are overlords of house cox the knight of saltpans and hosteens son arwood seem pretty concerned with the fate of saltpans there is a knight at saltpans ser arwood insisted he hid behind his walls whilst clegane and his mad dogs ravaged through his town you have not seen the things he did ser i have when the reports reached the twins i rode down with harys haigh and his brother donnel and half a hundred men archers and menatarms we thought it was lord berics work and hoped to find his trail all that remains of saltpans is the castle and old ser quincy so frightened he would not open his gates but shouted down at us from his battlements
asoiaf,not_removed,it was a terrible deal because all of that is stuff theyre already required to do no they are not they are not required to do shit for the son of the lord of the north they are riverlords the only two people they owe fealty to is the lord of riverrun and the king of westeros it is walders prerogative which one he wants to obey notice how the frey soldiers at the inn were free to turn down cat tullys request for assistance at the inn and westeros is not an absolute monarchy it is a feudalistic one by and large that means powerful lords like walder can negotiate who they want to follow or do as little as they want as others fight they may suffer consequences for this later down the line but more often than not houses usually dont get punished harshly at least for staying neutral when all you get out of a deal is what you should expect with no questions whatsoever its a bad deal when robb heard that his father had been arrested by his king he called his banners and went to war walder frey becomes culpable giving this rebel army access to his lands even more so if he adds his own military to the rebel lord you might have a point if hoster tully ordered walder to do so but he never did and robb did not even give him the hypothetical option to send a raven to hoster asking permission to do this as robb ordered all ravens entering and leaving the twins shot but thats also pretty good evidence hes a fairweather friend at best and that the alliance didnt have good long term prospects sure most nobles would be like that if lord tully has been mocking the late lord walder for the last years then of course he is less likely to go out of his way to assist hoster when he is in need and i imagine the feeling would be mutual there was no love lost between these two men of course walder would need incentive to help him the freys supplied robb with more men than any of his northern vassals did robb did not win a single victory without frey support house freys heir died on campaign with robb stark while many other sons and grandsons were taken hostage as robb sent a large number of freys with roose in a battle that was always always going to be a loss they may have turned traitor late on with cause but they were hardly fairweather to robb they rebelled against the crown when the reach and stormlands was still part of it and it was unclear whether they would even reach riverrun in time before it fell which is why this should be planned ahead of time so that the northern half of the garrison is able to get the better of the frey garrison before the frey men return from their various posts do you not realize how idiotic this plan is to go to war against your own allies when you are fighting enemies who outnumber you luckily both robb and cat are not this short sighted i never meant to ser stevron died for me and olyvar was as loyal a squire as any king could want he asked to stay with me but ser ryman took him with the rest all their strength the greatjon urged me to attack them fighting your own in the midst of your enemies she said it would have been the end of you it is just a dumb move he would start a civil war in the riverlands against a portion of his own allies and as for the opinion of other riverlords theres likely to be disquiet but the freys arent respected by their peers and will not have earned any new friends by holding back their men from edmures cause lord charlton is his vassal lord vypren is married to one of his daughters and there are many other marriage alliances in the riverlands to house frey house tully might not like them but many others are going to be conflicted when choosing between their own blood and robb who is in the wrong in this situation return the dowry then how can he return the dowry when freys have died possibly around soldiers at the green fork and been imprisoned freys have already been instrumental in his victory over jaime and they have already made enemies of the crown and tywin lannister how exactly does robb return that and yeah the comparison to aerys falls flat aerys kept jaime as a hostage to keep tywin in line you are suggesting that robb stark do the exact thing that aerys did i am sorry that you dont see a pretty obvious comparison but it is right there this is a targeted action against a single house that is unpopular which plays on their image to make the whole action seem more justified you are confusing with how the tullys see house frey and how other riverland houses do the freys betrayed robb and now they are going to find it hard to get decent marriage prospects without overpaying for the privilege the same would happen to robb stark should he break his oath to the freys and hold their heir hostage to get his own way few houses would be willing to marry a year old boy who has shown his word can not be trusted oh and this is how vital the freys were to robb we must win back the freys said robb with them we still have some chance of success however small without them i see no hope i am willing to give lord walder whatever he requires apologies honors lands gold there must be something that would soothe his pride the idea that he should willingly betray them is idiotic the fact that many think he doomed himself by betraying the freys shows just how dumb this plan of yours is jaime felt almost sorry for robb stark he won the war on the battlefield and lost it in a bedchamber poor fool jaime for a moment tyrion could not believe hed heard his father right he broke his sworn word he said incredulous he threw away the freys for words failed him tyrion just who do you think robb was going to get that would have been better use to him than the freys
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree with u and walder frey is a hypocrite as he didnt defend the riverlands when the lannisters first attacked but red wedding apologists will twist events so the starks look like the bad guys
asoiaf,not_removed,you arent wrong but there was no common cause with anyone once he allowed himself to be called king no matter who won they were coming for him once they finished up their own war
asoiaf,not_removed,ah good attewell is great his analysis shows so thoroughly how many assumptions of the fandom are wrong and how they misinterpret it how the starks arent just idiots and how the villains arent as justified as many like to make out and of course the red wedding was an atrocity despite the desperate attempts of the lannister apologists to say it was and that the starks deserved what they got
asoiaf,not_removed,and if he throws them away hell be forced to fight them if he ever returns home
asoiaf,not_removed,but they didnt suggest this to robb and they could have not performed the red wedding but openly declared loyalty to the lannisters after leaving robb and roose bolton sends the men off to die at duskendale after hearing this so i dont think they can be looked upon as taking the justified option
asoiaf,not_removed,no reason are you sure about that and look what happened to him half the realm turned against him and he was overthrown no justifiable reason and yeah theyre not comparable situations in the slightest they are not a single house though lord charlton is his vassal lord vypren is his soninlaw and there are other riverland houses connected to him who may have more loyalty to their own blood than they would do to robb and what would they do if the freys themselves arent actively fighting the starks beyond just do what most of the riverlords did anyway which is go home to clear out their own lands the same point about hostages applies to the frey kin as it does to the freys themselves and even some of them are likely to not object this is where playing on the freys reputation is important because many of the houses who are married into their family still dont respect them they are considered of lesser bloodline and theres a real resentment on the part of the nobles who have to marry bellow their station out of monetary need which is the reason most houses marry into the freys you do realize that robbs own grandfather demanded a marriage alliance to fight in roberts rebellion or that robbs ancestor demanded a marriage pact to fight in the dance of the dragons as did the lord baratheon in the same war a marriage alliance is not an outrageous price cat certainly did not think so it was the trident all over damn the man her brother edmure had called the banners by rights lord frey should have gone to join the tully host at riverrun yet here he sat game of thrones catelyn ix cat actually does think its outrageous that hes not going to support his liege lord to demand any price is outrageous she just swallows it because getting caught up on it wont help anyone and yeah for doing your barest feudal obligations a marriage is an outrageous price part of the basic feudal contract is that vassals pledge to support their liege in times of war of course its not too rare for vassals to hold back all but the bare minimum of troops for a liege they dont like nor is it extraordinarily rare for grasping ambitious houses to demand something in return the freys demanded an enormous price even by those standards several fostered children that robb take one on as a squire and that they get to marry two starks thats a shit ton to demand and everyone who hears it will know its a shit ton to demand the riverlords fighting for the starks will also know that for the most part they already dont like the freys walder freys reputation for opportunistic grabs for power and that in the two previous battles edmure fought their own people likely died in the place of the freys who had been faithless combine all of that together and you dont have a particularly sympathetic audience about the plight of the freys also in all the cases you mention its an example of peers who have no formal obligations on one another demanding something in order to join in the fight rather than a vassal demanding a price out of the allies of their liege which sounds like a small difference but means a lot in any kind of feudal system hoster tully had no reason to fight for the heads of jon arryn ned stark and robert baratheon beyond the fact his daughters ended up married to the two of them by previously existing precedent aegon actually was the rightful king of the seven kingdoms and supporting rhaenyra was a rebellion against lawful authority and in the case of the baratheon lord hes generally remembered as a faithless asshole
asoiaf,not_removed,as walder frey said they swore an oath to the crown to the king sitting on the iron throne who at the time was joffery which oath should they follow the marriage offer caused them to lean to robb
asoiaf,not_removed,you made this up no i didnt its stated pretty directly in the mystery knight that they are looked down on as coin clinkers and toll collectors in other words theyre looked down on because theyre of lesser bloodline and status than their peers i dont know how to tell you this but robb stark is not lord tully and how is a marriage an outragous cost robb stark is hoster tullys grandson and was coming to his aid in a war and they were barring his way thats pretty directly violating their obligations to support riverrun in times of war which doesnt even touch on the fact that they were also refusing to send their troops out to support lord tully and only did so after extracting a hefty price and yeah for doing shit youre legally required to do any cost is a lot but especially demanding two marriages fostering two children and making one son a squire of a lords son
asoiaf,not_removed,not with the hostages that walder frey gave him
asoiaf,not_removed,but they didnt suggest this to robb so where is the betrayal you made a claim that the freys were planning to break their alliance before news reached them of robbs wedding where is the evidence for this and roose bolton sends the men off to die at duskendale after hearing this so i dont think they can be looked upon as taking the justified option what does this have to do with your original point about the freys
asoiaf,not_removed,no justifiable reason brandon and his posse came to kings landing and threatened the life of the prince that is treason certainly a justifiable yet harsh punishment the only person who was punished unfairly was rickard and what would they do if the freys themselves arent actively fighting the starks and why would the freys just give in after being betrayed theyd side with somone anyone else and the riverlords who are close to them however few they are would likely side with them robb is now fighting multiple enemies in the riverlands this is where playing on the freys reputation is important because many of the houses who are married into their family still dont respect them have you a source for this the lannisters starks and tullys who are both of a higher rank look down on them pleas show any evidence of other houses not respecting the freys prior to the red wedding they are considered of lesser bloodline no they are not they are considered younger and less prestigious than some like the thousands of year old tullys cat actually does think its outrageous that hes not going to support his liege lord well first of all i said she did not think the marriage was an outrageous price but ignoring that you are wrong as she suggested before robb even got to the twins that walder may be hedging his bets if you are half expecting something to happen then you dont find it outrageous and yeah for doing your barest feudal obligations a marriage is an outrageous price walder has no feudal obligations to robb none whatsoever robb is asking him to open his gates not his actual lords hoster and joffey and no cat does not think it an outrageous price i consent robb said solemnly he had never seemed more manly to her than he did in that moment boys might play with swords but it took a lord to make a marriage pact knowing what it meant by all means quote where she is outraged by the prospect of it the freys demanded an enormous price even by those standards no they did not several fostered children that robb take one on as a squire you do realize that benefits the starks as well as they get two hostages of their own thats a shit ton to demand so is asking a lord to rebel against his king and at the time the vast majorty of the kingdom robb was getting the better side of that deal without walders assistance his war in the riverlands was finished hoster tully had no reason to fight for the heads of jon arryn ned stark and robert baratheon walder frey has no reason to fight for robb stark the tullys were not kings their power comes directly from the crown
asoiaf,not_removed,i will take your word for it in the mystery knight too lazy to look so i wont argue that point walder frey has to listen to commands from people hoster tully and king joffrey and neither of those two characters asked him to let robb cross
asoiaf,not_removed,that wont stop him a smart man will simply ambush his enemies rear as he goes up the causeway and rout him
asoiaf,not_removed,evidently unclear was i you said the freys wanted to tell robb to surrender but they never do meaning that they have already begun plotting to betray him but ok i agree my point about roose isnt entirely connected to the freys but it does show that roose was trying to weaken robb before asos saw him lose the freys and karstarks though it could depend on whether the freys knew what roose was up to in sending the men to duskendale
asoiaf,not_removed,walder frey has to listen to commands from people hoster tully and king joffrey and neither of those two characters asked him to let robb cross there is no reasonable way to argue that hoster tully has to specifically tell him to allow robb stark through so that he can rescue hoster from a siege and every single one of his peers was listening to hoster tullys orders to assemble so his listening to orders from prince jeoffrey pretty clearly justifies him being absolutely untrustworthy
asoiaf,not_removed,yes because forfeiting the lives of hostages is smart
asoiaf,not_removed,you said the freys wanted to tell robb to surrender but they never do how do you expect them to do that when robb is not there in person and a day or so later news reaches them of robbs marriage when did they have time to tell robb hate to break this to you but they dont have snapchat in westeros meaning that they have already begun plotting to betray him where is the evidence for this that they were trying to betray him before he betrayed them but it does show that roose was trying to weaken robb before asos saw him lose the freys and karstarks go on then show this evidence before the chapter that they hear of robbs betrayal
asoiaf,not_removed,walder frey explained this edmure managed to get his ass kicked before he could finish calling all his troops thats not his fault and someone listening to the royal family makes them untrustworthy
asoiaf,not_removed,routing an enemy and taking hostages to exchange is smart
asoiaf,not_removed,youre also assuming the freys will succeed in an ambush when throughout the war its stated robb has very effective outriders and scouts and that the freys men will be able to route a force three times their size
asoiaf,not_removed,well they could have sent a raven to robb we know they hadnt heard of his marriage at that point instead they leave then tell robb they are willing to join him then treacherously have him and thousands of his men murdered and there is a difference in scale between breaking a marriage pact and treacherously murdering him as for roose tell him to put the captives to the sword and the castle to the torch by command of the king then he is to join forces with robett glover and strike east toward duskendale those are rich lands and hardly touched by the fighting it is time they had a taste glover has lost a castle and tallhart a son let them take their vengeance on duskendale but was it by command of the king when they brought him word of the battle at duskendale where lord randyll tarly had shattered robett glover and ser helman tallhart he might have been expected to rage instead hed stared in dumb disbelief and said duskendale on the narrow sea why would they go to duskendale hed shook his head bewildered a third of my foot lost for duskendale and later duskendale robb made the word a curse robett glover will answer for that when i see him i promise you a folly lord bolton agreed but glover was heedless after he learned that deepwood motte had fallen grief and fear will do that to a man so roose had already decided to betray robb and sends thousands of his men to be killed
asoiaf,not_removed,when throughout the war its stated robb has very effective outriders and scouts some of whom include actual freys when the blackfish goes west it is martn rivers who leads the riverlands outriders in his absence so there is a chance that turning against the freys actually weakens his outriders after all the trip back to the twins before the red wedding shows robb in the dark about what had happened to rooses army
asoiaf,not_removed,so roose had already decided to betray robb and sends thousands of his men to be killed that order happens on the same day and in the same chapter that arya learns that the freys have been betrayed do you have any evidence that roose did not known about the marriage or did you simply read it on a blog and take it as fact well they could have sent a raven to robb we know they hadnt heard of his marriage at that point a raven to where and they hear of his marriage a day or so later in the very same chapter you dont have any evidence of them betraying robb before the marriage
asoiaf,not_removed,roose gives the order just after the meeting with the freys later the freys receive the news that robb has broken the pact and elmar mentions that the marriage pact is off even though the marriage pact with arya should still be on
asoiaf,not_removed,roose gives the order just after the meeting with the freys it happens the same day and arya mentions that roose receives regular ravens from his wife at the twins later the freys receive the news that robb has broken the pact we actually dont see that we can work it out because of the conversation she has with elmar but we are not told at what point the freys are told both the orders for duskendale and the news of robbs betrayal happen on the same time if you can prove that roose was not informed before arya was then i would love for you to prove it
asoiaf,not_removed,well the freys dont mention the marriage pact in the meeting so it was unlikely the news had reached them
asoiaf,not_removed,well the freys dont mention the marriage pact in the meeting we know the news reached them later in that very chapter whats wrong arya asked him when she saw the tears shining on his cheeks my princess he sobbed weve been dishonored aenys says there was a bird from the twins my lord father says ill need to marry someone else or be a septon up until that point in the chapter they were loyal even still calling robb their king now you made a claim that and the freys at harrenhal in aryas last acok chapter are planning to break their alliance with robb before they heard he had broken the marriage pact and yet you have shown zero fucking evidence of such a thing
asoiaf,not_removed,you do have a habit of dismissing my evidence and claiming there is none the freys are trying to back out of their agreement with robb they havent yet planned the villainy of the red wedding but they are looking for an excuse and as i pointed out roose has already sent the men to die at duskendale he has already decided to betray robb but pov limitations mayhaps some people will decide the freys actions and words dont mean they are treacherous u seem to think that the freys are noble and were always in the right
asoiaf,not_removed,looks like the dailymailuk tabloid mistook what looks like emilia clarke and conleth hill goofing around inbetween takes as a dramatic scene being filmed
asoiaf,not_removed,conleth hill is known for goofing around off screen and trying to make actors who are being filmed laugh by doing things like making faces at them off camera did you expect us to not watch the dvd commentaries
asoiaf,not_removed,so they got bored and decided to fake some spoilers theres nothing wrong with that but more now they need to up their game on the fake spoilers
asoiaf,not_removed,so his ps what do you guys think is he endorsing the thought that some spoilers were staged for the onlookers or was he commenting on those written leaks uawayforthelads made up
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think the pictures weve seen where there were or cameras involved were fake spoilers ultimately they are there to work so every minute costs and wouldnt waste time to think up fake spoilers of course the picture that the dm has picked up is simply hilarious and i am glad they are taking it this was its fun on both sides having no twow for so long later in just makes people so much more hungry for the story line i wouldnt really blame anyone as far as i can tell the more spoilers i end up on the more excited with anticipation i get
asoiaf,not_removed,the mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her this might be foreshadowing daenerys conquering of westeros she is referred to as a mother often mhysamother of dragons and shows mercy to those who kneel you spent too much time with us jon snow you can never be a kneeler again ―tormund giantsbane to jon snow
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its being set up for jamie to repeat history danys army will be knocking at the gates cersei will be screaming to burn them all and jamie will be all like not this shit again and fulfill the whole killed by your younger brother prophecy
asoiaf,not_removed,walder frey talked about being king slayers to jaime in the finale to be fair someone mentions jaime being a kingslayer in pretty much every episode jaime is in
asoiaf,not_removed,makes perfect sense can you add since craziness to bring it to tinfoil level
asoiaf,not_removed,the warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice i thought this was a stab at the high sparrow himself i suspect given his new position and arrogance that he believed himself beyond justice
asoiaf,not_removed,if jaime kills cersei then who becomes kingqueen then and if cersei is dead by the time daenerys shows up to kings landing does she just say by rights the throne belongs to me over anyone else so no need for the senseless fighting and just crown me queen
asoiaf,not_removed,father jon mother daenerys warrior jaime smith gendrybranvarys maiden sansa crone melisandre stranger arya
asoiaf,not_removed,i like it
asoiaf,not_removed,hs team sparrows blasting off again
asoiaf,not_removed,this is my guess for the other im going by the httpgameofthroneswikiacomwikitheseven in the wiki the mother dany suggested the warrior jaime suggested the stranger someone who learned enough to become no one wink wink the father ned stark the crone maggy the frog prophetic fortune teller from cerseis youth is a strong contender the smith gendry the maiden brienne of tarth she is pure of heart and still a virgin innocent a protector of the innocent beautiful in an unconventional way that unconventional beauty is partly why jaime might be falling for her
asoiaf,not_removed,this sub thinks literally every sentence in this series is foreshadowing
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt the high sparrow wrong when he says he warrior those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice isnt justice usually the fathers job
asoiaf,not_removed,im pretty certain arya will kill cersei if jaime was going to do it they would have included the valonquar prophecy in the maggie the frog scene
asoiaf,not_removed,not really related to the thread but just realized carl wont get to stare at natalie dormer anymore whats the point of even watching now
asoiaf,not_removed,that could also be said about him he thought he was the voice of the seven he ended up burnt just as much as the rest of them
asoiaf,not_removed,in the books cat calls jon an example of a warrior while shes praying
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly the warrior could be cersei and all the pricks in the sept might be the ones being punished not everyone deserved to get fried but the sparrows sure did
asoiaf,not_removed,with this sub nowadays it seems every word is a foreshadowing that deserves hundreds of upvotes
asoiaf,not_removed,i think you give too much credit to the shows writers
asoiaf,not_removed,the gods is really god with faces from the wiki the father represents divine justice and judges the souls of the dead the mother represents mercy peace fertility and childbirth she is sometimes referred to as the strength of women the maiden represents purity innocence love and beauty the crone represents wisdom and foresight she is represented carrying a lantern the warrior represents strength and courage in battle the smith represents creation and craftsmanship the stranger the stranger represents death and the unknown it is rarely prayed to ive seen arya represent the stranger the many faced god the faceless god i think jon is the warrior dany is the mother of dragons breaker of the wheel im trying to figure out who the other characters are and how they match up with the faced god
asoiaf,not_removed,as far as all the ridiculous secret message shitposts go this is by far the least shitty
asoiaf,not_removed,and shows mercy to those who kneel yeah except that one time when she crucified masters or that one time when showdany grilled two masters because she wanted to frighten them into confessing that theyre terrorists
asoiaf,not_removed,is it time for the foil to come out already
asoiaf,not_removed,youre just really grasping with this one
asoiaf,not_removed,rofl
asoiaf,not_removed,all those are traits of azor ahai both might be about jon or daenerys
asoiaf,not_removed,the warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice he was foreshadowing his own death he got too much power imprisoned and tortured people and denied people to be judged by the gods making the boy king forbid trial by combat
asoiaf,not_removed,aegon the conqueror showed mercy to those that kneel so the family precedent is there the lannisters killed her family and she forgave tyrion who knelt before her
asoiaf,not_removed,i think this might be foreshadowing jaime killing cersei i think its foreshadowing alright but i think its referring to someone else i think this might be foreshadowing the high sparrows demise the high sparrow is always doling out justice based on what the gods think its not so much that he thinks he cant be punished by the gods as he thinks he wont be punished by the gods we see many instances of the sparrows doing terrible things to people and they believe that since its in the name of the gods their actions are just even though they clearly arent and they wont be punished
asoiaf,not_removed,could also be foreshadowing cersei donning armour killing the faith militant the high sparrow displays all kinds of hubris in his zeal
asoiaf,not_removed,jon snow will not be kneeling to her but he will be marrying her
asoiaf,not_removed,i think daenerys will have to decide between defeating the white walkers or cersei choosing to save the world from the white walkers and then jamie will kill cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,poor jaime will have a worse reputation than walder frey after hes done with cersei walder frey wasnt even willing to kill edmure because it would be considered kinslaying king kin and queenslayer
asoiaf,not_removed,i figured this was actually the high sparrow foreshadowing himself he saw himself as outside the reach of justice and refused to kneel look where his gods got him
asoiaf,not_removed,if it were grrm writing it maybe i have no faith in this level of foreshadowing for the show though every time i hear a cool theory or idea about meaning or intrigue the show comes out with a terrible explanation
asoiaf,not_removed,solid as iraq
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the hs parallels cersei and his own words applied to himself more than anything everyone believes their own actions to be good regardless of how the world views them they both thought themselves polar opposites to one another and yet they both used their power to torture kill and manipulate people to do their will they both thought themselves above the law cersei used the crown and the hs used the seven to bend people to do their bidding neither of them actually killed anyone themselves yet both are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people that received no fair trial they both thought themselves too clever and that their plans were ingenious when in reality they have both been fools the entire time both of their selfish actions resulted in the deaths of almost everyone they loved i never considered the hs to be a good person he was the same hypocrite we see in people who still practice religion today
asoiaf,not_removed,its prophetic for the sparrow himself
asoiaf,not_removed,the fact dorn the iron islands well some of them and now the tyrells are moving towards an alliance with daenerys it is more likely she will marry john snow to gain support from the north i feel the whole kingslayer line had more to do with the righteousness of jaimes character rather than a foreshadowing edit or i guess she could also marry into the richest house in westeros jaime may be coming around by this point
asoiaf,not_removed,you know that line actually really irked me the warrior does not pass judgement and justice thats the fathers job
asoiaf,not_removed,what mercy has she ever shown letting people be free after being raped by guys instead of getting the mercy of death after being used up as a horselords chewtoy while watching everything youve ever loved burn daenerys knows nothing of mercy and you green milkmaids who post here during the got season are really getting on my tits
asoiaf,not_removed,im getting more of a jon vibe from that somewhat i think it makes more sense somewhat because of the ties between jon and dany
asoiaf,not_removed,sometimes a line of dialog is just a line of dialog its just people talking not everything spoken in the show is symbolic or foreshadowing of things to come
asoiaf,not_removed,i just need to say that i hate the gods of the so much they can punish you and forgive you at the same time this makes it all to convenient to believe that the gods control everything that happens because it was a just a different one doing it the whole thing makes me really upset even though its a fictional religion
asoiaf,not_removed,youre definitely reading too much into the situation these lines are probably straight out of the seven pointed star
asoiaf,not_removed,ok why would jamie kill cersei hed do anything for her hes almost a slave to her a willing one
asoiaf,not_removed,my question is what will jamie do ifwhen tryion shows up at kings landing with danaerys will he side with his brother or his sister
asoiaf,not_removed,youre reading too far into it thats basically the same thing he said when he first met cercei the warriors give justice to warriors but the church is the only thing that can punish the royalty that was her entire reason for giving the sept militarily power its kinda funny and slightly schizoid to be looking for so many patterns that arent there
asoiaf,not_removed,to me that sounds like the high sparrow foreshadowing his own death but i totally buy your theory
asoiaf,not_removed,yes as things progress i think its clear that jamie is the valonqar
asoiaf,not_removed,so what does the stranger say about the high sparrow youre fucked dude
asoiaf,not_removed,im also thinking daenerys will conquer westeros but abolish the kingqueen stuff i think she sees it as a form of slavery
asoiaf,not_removed,good spot wonder if jamie will be known as queenslayer or kingslayer or the regicider
asoiaf,not_removed,i think you are wishing for too much jaime and cersei are one if jaime is the valonqar that strangles her his death will soon follow
asoiaf,not_removed,i really hope euron comes and sinks all those invading cunts who want to bring more war to westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime is killing cersei he came into the world holding on to her ankle she will go out of the world with jaime holding on to her neck
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought it was foreshadowing his own death cerseis a warrior and she punished the shit out of the high sparrow who believed himself beyond the reach of justice
asoiaf,not_removed,lol come on now bro the prophecy states she will be killed by her brother you could make anything be a foreshadow this could mean a lot of people not trying to be a jerk by saying that but everyone knows cersei will die from her brother lol im sure ill be downvoted for this post but im just pointing out the obvious
asoiaf,not_removed,this is my wifes theory he already killed one ruler for indiscriminate use of wild fire or whatever
asoiaf,not_removed,ive been thinking a lot about the seven and i think they correspond directly to characters mother dany warrior jon stranger arya crone olenna some more tentative ones father ned smith gendry maiden brienne e formatting
asoiaf,not_removed,valonqar prophecy jaime will lose it cersei is responsible for the death of all of his children tyrion partly for his daughter but if cersei hadnt been such a cunt tyrion would never have shipped her to dorne jaime will destroy her jaime will probably also destroy the mountain to get to her
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i noticed that as well i think jamie is going to finally do what he needs to and kill cercei for what she did to everyone at the trial resulting in the death of their last child then i think when daenerys makes it to westeros jamie will be talked down by tyrion and forgiven by her
asoiaf,not_removed,the warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice i think its better as fore shadowing the death of everyone in that temple high sparrow was maybe the most smug over confident character on the show so far presuming to have the gods protection
asoiaf,not_removed,the mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her another possible interpretation of this as foreshadowing could be that dany will make a pact with the faith or given the recent events perhaps make a pact with surviving faith leaders to revive the faith under her protection there is major precedent for this in the fact that aegon the conqueror essentially did this when he originally took over he literally knelt before the high septon and received his blessing and endorsement as king
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope so
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime lannister the queenslayer
asoiaf,not_removed,the high sparrows words seemed to also be foreshadowing his own pending doom the warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice the warrior could be interpreted as cersei clad in her black battle armor punishing the hs who believes himself beyond the reach of her selfentitled version of justice
asoiaf,not_removed,this story is so complex and full of characters that people might see foreshadowing where it doesnt exist still great post
asoiaf,not_removed,nice catch
asoiaf,not_removed,the warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice thats exactly what the hound did
asoiaf,not_removed,you give the writers of got wayyyyy too much credit in my opinion to believe that they think so far ahead
asoiaf,not_removed,it could also be foreshadowing the high sparrows own death as he sees himself as beyond the reach of justice
asoiaf,not_removed,no no no absolutley wrong the fucking hound is gonna swoop in destroy everyfucking one take widows wail because hes always wanted valrian steel and then daenarys will be at kings landing taking that shit over then will meet with her brother heir to the mother fucking iron throne king of the motherfucking north jon snow targaryen then them and tyrion will get on the dragons and kill the shit out of some white walkers little do they know the motherfucking hound has met with arya and is already beyond the wall arya chopped the face off of one to infiltrate them bitches and confuse them because guess what thats right the fucking hound comes in and chops all those pussy into dust the world is now at peace and we all lived ahppily ever after
asoiaf,not_removed,that aint jamie jamies dead a girl has his face a girl will cross another name off her list
asoiaf,not_removed,could it be that jon is the father dany is the mother brienne is the maiden jaime is the warrior gentry is the blacksmith if he ever shows up mel is the crone and arya is the stranger
asoiaf,not_removed,i think this is all about the us elections this year specifically the dnc old man calling for justice upon the powerful gathers a following but gets taken out by the scheming of the crazy woman who cannot let someone else take power from her haha
asoiaf,not_removed,im still in the boat that religion is bad war is bad hippies rule make love not peace with the others
asoiaf,not_removed,few days after season and the tinfoil is real already i should unsubscribe from here till next april i think
asoiaf,not_removed,its a prophecy earlier in the series cersei had a flashback when she went to a palm reader when she was younger and the crazy lady said she would bore kings and later be killed by a younger brother cersei thought it would be tyrion but its actually jamie
asoiaf,not_removed,could the faith of the seven be alluding to seven main characters jaime the warrior daenerys the mother arya the stranger the smith the maiden the crone the father
asoiaf,not_removed,this might be foreshadowing daenerys conquering of westeros i dont understand why they would foreshadow something that isnt going to happen
asoiaf,not_removed,not every fucking thing that happens in this show is foreshadowing something its great that you learned that word in english class this year but please consider the fact that the writers arent trying to fill the story with foreshadowing
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont get this sub i posted the same thing a couple of days ago and it got downvoted and now this is the top post
asoiaf,not_removed,aaaaand the endless low quality foreshadowing posts begin must be end of season
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly i think jon would beggar himself before her for assistance against the others if the north is being overrun
asoiaf,not_removed,if theres a marriage pact he wont have to kneel
asoiaf,not_removed,now hes dakingindanorf and will never have to kneel again
asoiaf,not_removed,hes her nephew though
asoiaf,not_removed,har
asoiaf,not_removed,its being set up for him to kill cersei and be known as the queen slayer and side with dany
asoiaf,not_removed,as dany approaches from the south bwb approach from the west cersi calls for robert strong to burn them all wickedly eyeing a vial of wildfire she keeps in the throne room as a reminder to her enemies a sword pierces her from the back jaime kingslayer again the tip of the sword pierces the vial of wildfire she holds setting it alight and coating the sword jaime slowly pulls the burning sword from the heart of his lover just then bwb rushes in as the flames spread around the room the hound must overcome his fear of fire to find and finally slay his brother cleganebowl jaime azor ahai
asoiaf,not_removed,killed by your younger brother prophecy wait what
asoiaf,not_removed,hes going to become azor ahai jamies to do list killed the mad king kill the mad queen kill nights king
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty sure jamie will kill cersei and himself to ar the same time to stop it they entered the world together and will leave together my guess is he drags her out a window and maybe even reprises the things i do for love
asoiaf,not_removed,also i took this as the writers reminding casual watchers what walder frey actually did to deserve arya scott tenormaning him later in the episode
asoiaf,not_removed,heres some craziness because the are just multiple faces of the same god jamie is daenerys weve yet to see them in the same room at the same time and varys has proven that you can teleport back and forth across the narrow sea between scenes he jumped from talking to barbara olenna to having all their ships sailed to essos and grouped up with danys ships to sail back to westeros on danys boat all in minutes so jaemerystm could just be flying back and forth this whole time
asoiaf,not_removed,alright cersei is a widow to do kill her hes going to need a sword ergo hes going to use widows wail joffreys part of ice which turns out to be lightbringer which in turn means jaime is azor ahai i can add some tinfoily parallels between iceoathkeeperwidows wail if you want
asoiaf,not_removed,the high sparrow thought he was untouchable the people in the room thought they were free from judgement it wasnt their trial but i think thats just something extra loras knelt before the mother so what if he was granted mercy and wasnt harmed by the wildfire explosion then after being saved by the mother vows to bring cersei to the justice of the gods he will become the warrior set out to punish cersei he will defeat the mountain and make it known to all what he will do to cersei but theres a problem hes not a younger brother jamie and cersei are cornered locking themselves in a room jamie knows they dont stand a chance and so strangles cersei to avoid the pain and suffering that she would recieve from loras
asoiaf,not_removed,what on earth had the high sparrow done which deserved justice edit obviously homophobia etc are bad things by modern standards i was asking what hed done that would be considered bad by the moral standards of the setting and church of the seven
asoiaf,not_removed,i think by right cersei shouldnt be queen im pretty sure that the flood gates are open for the throne
asoiaf,not_removed,then jon shows up and goes well actually
asoiaf,not_removed,my guess is it happens while danys army is attacking the city we see cersei go mad and try to burn them all like the mad king and jaime kills her to stop it
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry
asoiaf,not_removed,this is basically what grrm is saying rightful inheritance is nonsense and as the war goes on the occupier of the throne has a more and more tenuous claim
asoiaf,not_removed,ser pounce becomes king
asoiaf,not_removed,sansas not a maiden any more rasoiaf knows only one maiden whose name is lyanna mormont
asoiaf,not_removed,father jon why
asoiaf,not_removed,id go with brienne as the maiden the maiden represents purity innocence love and beauty she protects the chastity of virgins as well as protecting the innocent in general httpgameofthroneswikiacomwikitheseven and even better catelyn stark prays in a nameless villages sept she goes to the maid and beseeches her to lend her courage to arya and sansa to guard them in their innocence httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpmaidentheseven i cant see why bran should be the smith the smith is a hard worker that creates things ive only seen two guys with the intention to build euron ships and meribald church in some ways varys is a builder he creates situations for the good of the world jon as the father only works in combination with daenerys as mother if they hook up jon isnt big on justice that was more neds thing maybe bran cause he can see the past
asoiaf,not_removed,the warrior could be brianne as well
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion seems more the smith type to me
asoiaf,not_removed,i like you
asoiaf,not_removed,why would gendry be the smith hes a noncharacter he served his purpose in the show and is no longer needed there are tens of roberts bastards in the realm and neither they nor gendry will ever find out the truth even if they did who would care the obsession with gendry just completely baffles me and the crone could be either melisandre or bran imo
asoiaf,not_removed,plus shes blonde jamie has a thing for that
asoiaf,not_removed,to be fair grrm is masterful at foreshadowing in the books so its natural to look for some of that in the show
asoiaf,not_removed,hold the door
asoiaf,not_removed,margery says shell wake up with a string of dead sorrows around her neck she dies with sparrows arms holder her back by the neck
asoiaf,not_removed,hes talking specifically about the ones who think they are beyond the reach of justice the ones who need to be fought against etc
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think it would work so well having to explain the meaning of the word would seem a waste there is plenty of reason already for cersei to hate tyrion and they focused on jamie being the king slayer enough that a repeat would carry the appropriate weight
asoiaf,not_removed,heres some tinfoil for ya arya kills jaime and prepares his body so she can take his face then as jaime she kills cersei technically fulfilling the volonqar portion and also checking two off her list
asoiaf,not_removed,but were the masters truly kneeling
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but nobody is gonna cry over that
asoiaf,not_removed,oh hell no not possible
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah everyone knows the warrior just fucks shit up and eats pizza and stuff
asoiaf,not_removed,aye
asoiaf,not_removed,what was the foreshadowing
asoiaf,not_removed,its frustrating internally inconsistent and can be spun any way you want just like real world christianity
asoiaf,not_removed,just like real religions
asoiaf,not_removed,because she did exactly what he killed aerys to prevent from happening
asoiaf,not_removed,since its the most tragic option it seems very likely
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i agree with your opinion of the high sparrow foreshadowing his own death plus cersei doesnt believe she beyond punishment thats why she schemes so much to escape punishment
asoiaf,not_removed,who did the tylerslayer edit well now your fixing of that autocorrect error has put my joke out of context thatll teach me for being a smartass
asoiaf,not_removed,i think youre probably definitely on to something but could you replace some of the people with others who are more prominent crone probably lady olenna but maybe melisandre probably olenna father has to be sam neds been dead forever and sam is like the only good dad in the entire kingdom plus if its about wisdom then this is totally sam eventually postmaester smith tyrion hes crafty saddle for bran entire defense of blackwater bay etc
asoiaf,not_removed,i think others have assigned the seven to the stark family father ned mother catelyn warrior rob maiden sansa stranger arya crone bran builder rickon this is why a lot of people had speculated that rickon would rebuild winterfell
asoiaf,not_removed,i think joffrey dug his own grave
asoiaf,not_removed,cut down on the caffeine son
asoiaf,not_removed,what about the zombie icechickens
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think so arya doesnt know that hes not the same guy he used to br
asoiaf,not_removed,youd be the first to die
asoiaf,not_removed,are you gendry hes still in the boat too
asoiaf,not_removed,gendrys still in a boat too
asoiaf,not_removed,an oglaf comic comes to mind when you speak of sex with frozen beings
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry the smith but i dont see much plotpoint with him sansa the maiden olenna the crone these are all a stretch but this seems more so jon the father just because
asoiaf,not_removed,uhh ignoring your rude tone i think we should consider that the writers are in fact known to have and are likely to continue to use foreshadowing in this show
asoiaf,not_removed,please consider the fact that the writers arent trying to fill the story with foreshadowing how do you know that what evidence do you have that its fact its great that you learned to be angsty in highschool this year but please consider the fact that the writers might be trying to fill the story with foreshadowing
asoiaf,not_removed,the same reason for most things in life people are dumb
asoiaf,not_removed,jon has no pride hes like varys with a cock doing things for the good of the realm
asoiaf,not_removed,weve seen jon making all kind of shit for the greater good or the lesser evil he would kneel to dany is that means that shell use her dragons against thr white walkers
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel theyre setting up for a lot of similarities to the original conquering of westeros by the targareans one of those things being the king or lord im a little sketchy on the history in the north who knelt to the targareans to save his people instead of fighting
asoiaf,not_removed,would he even have to i feel like dany would try to stop the ice zombie apocalypse of her own volition
asoiaf,not_removed,the other lords wouldnt though thats kind of the problem if jon starts kneeling then his lords get pissy and before you know it he gets stabbed again he might be reluctant to risk that and hence refuse to kneel or maybe hell get stabbed
asoiaf,not_removed,not forcibly anyway ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
asoiaf,not_removed,king in the north and queen in the south
asoiaf,not_removed,arent they related edit apparently almost everything that isnt parentschild or brothersister is fair game problem solved
asoiaf,not_removed,im getting worried about this sub these days half the posts are encouraging incest
asoiaf,not_removed,torrhen stark knelt to dragons it was considered a good move
asoiaf,not_removed,but if theres a worthy ruler in kings landing he might be happy to help unite the realm
asoiaf,not_removed,he never wanted to be king though he just wants to protect the people id think a simple alliance and maybe the opportunity to be a dragon rider would make him more than happy if it means defeating the white walkers
asoiaf,not_removed,nice flair
asoiaf,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
asoiaf,not_removed,and targareans only marry their relatives so that actually would follow canon
asoiaf,not_removed,older nephew
asoiaf,not_removed,serena stark had four children with her uncle edric stark and her sister sansa stark was married to her uncle jonnel stark unclenice and auntnephew are probably fine in westeros if even the starks practice it
asoiaf,not_removed,im thinking he kills himself while or after taking out cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,theyll just start calling him slayer and then he marries dany and becomes king slayer
asoiaf,not_removed,i have a feeling jaime will have a really bittersweet story to the readers hell be a hero twice over but his legacy will be that of a traitor and coward
asoiaf,not_removed,the valonqar the prophecy goes something like marry the king but his children wont be yours younger and prettier queen will usurp you all your children will die then you will be killed by the valonqar valonqar is the high valyrian word for little brother shes always thought this meant tyrion which is why she always has nightmares of tyrion coming out if a secret passage and strangling her jaime was born second technically making him younger
asoiaf,not_removed,volanquar prophecy she will be strangled to death by her smaller brother she always thought it was tyrion but jaime was born a few seconds after her too
asoiaf,not_removed,whos that guy again remember that super traumatic seen that nobody could stop talking about for a year where everythi g was going good before everybody died horribly yeah that guy
asoiaf,not_removed,jaemerys is also jon snows real name
asoiaf,not_removed,can you squeeze in quentyn martell connection so we can call this character jaemeryquai
asoiaf,not_removed,talking to barbara i am slain
asoiaf,not_removed,if jamie is daenerys she killed her own father oo
asoiaf,not_removed,then whos batman
asoiaf,not_removed,jamie is daenerys jamie is a cheater cheating on cersei with daario
asoiaf,not_removed,its been established that things dont happen on a daily schedule in between scenes could be hours days or months varys travels were done in actual time its just that he left mereen went to dorne then came back and it took him however many months think of theon and asha travels from the iron islands we see them sailing away end of an episode and start of the next theyre in slavers bay
asoiaf,not_removed,re varys teleporting time is skipped we see dany in mereen talk with tyrion we see varys in dorne talking with olenna we dont see danys trip to dorne then we see dany and varys sailing from dorne to westeros as evidenced by greyjoy ships targaryan ships martell ships and tyrell ships all together in the fleet but before i learned that the varys warp bothered me too
asoiaf,not_removed,i am still placing my money on the hound being azor ahai i mean what better irony would it be for the lord of light who uses a flaming sword to be terrified of his own weapon and the hounds personality was born from salt and smoke gregors salt at his little brother playing with his toy and the smoke of the hounds face as it melted in the fire
asoiaf,not_removed,hasnt he only ever told that story to breane maybe he wrote it down in the kingsguard book i dont remember
asoiaf,not_removed,worst fashion sense in kings landing that potato sack was an affront to the god of tits and wine
asoiaf,not_removed,the faith became too involved in politics and the high sparrow was playing the game for power he his his vanity behind his clothes and appearance but he took joy in taking down powerful people the hs could come up with plenty of pious reasons that he should be locked up for his sins until he repented
asoiaf,not_removed,draconian punishments and an arbitrary black and white view of morality
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe not the high sparrow himself but his underlings have been running around attacking people and smashing livelihoods without fear of consequence
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah the hate against the high sparrow is pretty telling in my opinion about the personal feelings a lot of people have on this sub regarding religion and specifically large organized religions like catholicism let me first state that yes i realize the sparrows were homophobic but at the same time in the society portrayed in the show it seems like everyone is homophobic short of a few characters but when you look at the high sparrow we never see him as anything but devout shrewd and unpretentious he never really does anything in conflict with what he says and when others try to call him out for personal failings he readily admitted they were right at no point did his humility appear to be for show and yet he seems to get more hate on this sub than just about anyone including scheming murderers in addition we know the high sparrows support was rooted among the smallfolk and that the sparrowsfaith militant were stepping in to protect commoners because the war of the five kings hadwas continuing to destroy their homes lives and livelihoods even as a character he was pretty interesting written well and acted even better so when it comes down to it most of this hate he gets pretty much has to be the result of peoples personal biases against realworld religious figures that they are projecting onto the show the thing i find most fascinating is that as viewers of the show our understanding of the story is mostly from the perspective of the highborn lords and ladies participating in the game of thrones and relatively little from the perspective of the commoners and so when a character like the high sparrow emerges as an outsider as a representative of the will of the commoners and a potential foil to the ambitions of the high born nobles we have been following most viewers seem to have taken an visceral hostile attitude towards him and in that sense the viewers too seem to join the ranks of the nobility who care more about the outcome of their political struggles and personal squabbles than the desires of the majority of the realm that said people are entitled to their personal opinions their personal justifications and there is no wrong way to feel about a character but i personally really liked the character of the high sparrow not only because of how well the character was written and acted but because having a devout unhypocritical religious figure who represents the collective rage of the common folk is a particularly compelling character in my opinion i would have liked to see him explored a bit more although if he had to go out the way they did it in the show was pretty amazing
asoiaf,not_removed,he enjoyed power he enjoyed breaking people it wasnt about the gods at least not at the end he pictured himself as being so powerful that there was nothing cersei could do to him
asoiaf,not_removed,imprisoning people for being gay or having too much sex and torturing them
asoiaf,not_removed,he was a religious fanatic who tortured innocents brutalized people for not behaving as he saw fit and was willing to execute them for the same and he dies all this horror for personal power using the façade of his radical superstition to play the great game hes one of the more clear villains in the whole series
asoiaf,not_removed,what i dont like about the high sparrow is that he preaches about humility giving up pride not living in vanity he seems to care about the people but the whole time hes playing the game he manipulates tommen margery loras exerts his power on the crown and uses his sparrows to his own end makes me think he is all appearance and wants power just like everyone else
asoiaf,not_removed,lust for power perpetuated with coercion imprisoning people for their sexual behaviour forget modern standards the fucker was after power and thats it he played the game really well but he just wanted to control that crown he coerced and humiliated people under the pretense of righteousness because he enjoys it just as much as cersei he violently took over the royalty margery with tommen would have been the best thing for kings landing but the sparrow kidnapped her brother and kidnapped her fuck the sparrow he totally deserved what he got
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean he did sanction murder of innocents who got in his waythe sparrows way and kidnap and torture multiple people for confessions whether they are guilty or not is partially irrelevant because torturing people for a confession should be bad whether or not the person is guilty
asoiaf,not_removed,being a religious nut job who is imposing his will on the kingdom by using an army of brainwashed bornagain assholes
asoiaf,not_removed,the hs might not have done anything deserving justice but it seems fair to say that he believed himself beyond justice he thought he did no wrong because he was in the service of the seven he was more or less the most powerful judge in the seven kingdoms he knew he could do whatever he wanted and no one could do anything about it he may have been doing good and following the rules of the gods but he definitely had an elevated view of himself because of this perfect example he genuinely thought his work with margaery had made her more pious he didnt believe he could fail which makes him beyond the reach of justice if you dont do anything wrong theres no need for justice
asoiaf,not_removed,he was an unambiguously humble selfless and unhypocritical religious character in a tv show that makes him westeros greatest monster
asoiaf,not_removed,technically nothing though he did force the septons to vote him into office perhaps the seven didnt like it
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei has a claim roberts great grandfather is also a direct ancestor of cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah she absolutely usurped the throne people keep talking about whether or not she was in line for it like cersei cares she just wiped out everyone who had a royal position and indirectly killed the king the lords and ladies of the court are sure as hell not going to try and stop her
asoiaf,not_removed,power resides where people think it resides she was crowned so shes queen
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt she an usurper now she took it by force
asoiaf,not_removed,would be kind of excellent if in the episode this happens they also show us the scene they filmed of aerys and jamie for the first season via brans visions like start the episode with showing that flashback scene then end the episode with almost a shotbyshot recreation with cersei in the mad kings position qyburn in aerys hands position and jaime reliving it all with a dawning terror and realization that killing his sister and lover is the only option he has jaime sits exhausted on the throne and looks up to see jon standing at the bottom of the steps looking perplexed and with his hair put up just like ned wore it cut to the credits i dont know why jon would be there just wanted to complete the parallel
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe bran the builder
asoiaf,not_removed,arya is still a maidenso is brienne of tarth
asoiaf,not_removed,sansa is still a maiden in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,sansa is schrodingers maiden
asoiaf,not_removed,the father represents judgement he is depicted as a bearded man who carries scales he is prayed to for justice the warrior had been jaimes god since he was old enough to hold a sword
asoiaf,not_removed,i cant see why bran should be the smith the smith is a hard worker that creates things the assumption is that bran uses his time traveling greensight to tweak the past to set up all of the pieces to oppose the others in the present he may have directly been bran the builder who created the wall but it could also be more metaphorical in that he may have just nudged things into place to become the architect of the future
asoiaf,not_removed,username etc
asoiaf,not_removed,because gendry is literally a smith book gendry also suspects who his father is and has a lot more relevance also the rest of roberts bastards were murdered by cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought he had a thing for siblings watch out tyrion
asoiaf,not_removed,yes and the copy of one of the got i have has a quote from him that says something like its all in the details
asoiaf,not_removed,its weird that one of their gods is just a ninja turtle
asoiaf,not_removed,there really wasnt any casual mentions of catelyn and lenas instagram posts apparently count for foreshadowing around here edit sometime during the season lena posted a picture of pebbles put together to form a heart and captioned it my stone heart this sub lost its shit and everyone thought it meant lsh in the season finale when it didnt happen many people raged
asoiaf,not_removed,a pretty ironic family too apply andal theology to
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei was a pretty shitty parent too though i am sure some nurturing could have helped a bit i actually think joffrey was a better king than tommen too at least he ruled his kingdom not well but he did tommen was more of a mask for anyone to come along and wear also shitty parenting on cerseis part because high sparrow came and wore the tommen mask edit it also wont stop jaime from blaming her in angerrage i think
asoiaf,not_removed,ice nuggets
asoiaf,not_removed,that explains why they fucked on their sons corpse in the middle of jaimes redemption arc
asoiaf,not_removed,she doesnt care she wants to kill them all and she will just because we saw another side of him doesnt mean he wasnt always like that
asoiaf,not_removed,but has anyone tried hugging it out with the white walkers and how do we know that elaborate limb spiral pattern wasnt just their attempt at a drum circle
asoiaf,not_removed,i dunno the original night king from old nans story grabbed a piece of other ass and it turned out ok for him until those meddling starks
asoiaf,not_removed,dont you ever forget my apologies for referencing a horrible song
asoiaf,not_removed,well for them theyre one second man just takes one touch one the cheek of a newborn for them
asoiaf,not_removed,someone further down suggested the smith could be bran i have my own theories on how this fits in actually and the crone could be melisandre i imagine that if they are main characters theyd have to be pov in the books im sure sansa is still a maiden but not in the show
asoiaf,not_removed,i think this comment is foreshadowing how youre gonna get into a big argument some time in your life
asoiaf,not_removed,not only that but tyrion and varys are advisers to daenerys jon wont even need to kneel to gain assistance from daenerys when the time comes oh also the greyjoys didnt kneel
asoiaf,not_removed,tell that to kevan
asoiaf,not_removed,damn youre right its too bad the two of them would probably never get along
asoiaf,not_removed,and ploting for the targs
asoiaf,not_removed,varys has ambitions you just cant tell what they are because he has no cock so unlike other men they arent wrapped up in things like lust pride and masculinity
asoiaf,not_removed,hes like varys with a cock doing things for the good of the realm and for targaryen bastards
asoiaf,not_removed,varys in many ways is like the antilittlefinger both men are doing terrible despicable things through murder manipulation and seduction but whereas varys justification is for the whole of the realm in a very utilitarian stance petyr baelish is out for himself his own power weve even seen his own desire to sit upon the iron throne in some ways you could say that the entirety of asoiaf are two men battling each other using the world as their playground to bring about a new age for westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,why is everyone acting like he needs to beg her for help surely she doesnt want to see the walkers destroy westeros right after the conquers it
asoiaf,not_removed,imo jon and dany will marry he wont be kneeling targarians marry other targarians hes from westeros has a following and shes looking for a suitor
asoiaf,not_removed,torrhen stark the king who knelt
asoiaf,not_removed,the lords kiss
asoiaf,not_removed,whered you learn how to do that thing with your tongue jon snow
asoiaf,not_removed,but then again perhaps forcefully
asoiaf,not_removed,targs
asoiaf,not_removed,there was a guy in another post that said because both of danaerys parentsgrandparents were brothersister pairs it genetically puts her and jon at close to the same genetic level as brothersister would be in normal siblings edit i cant seem to find the comment to link but it was something like normal siblings from non incest share dna because of all the incest rhaegardanaerys share dna and danyjon are at something like but my numbers arent exact since im not a fucking geneticist
asoiaf,not_removed,aunt and nephew is acceptable in westeros so are cousins its the parentschildren brotherssisters that is more problematic
asoiaf,not_removed,its the targaryen way
asoiaf,not_removed,its leaking
asoiaf,not_removed,you are the only on bringing up incest right now
asoiaf,not_removed,not in bird culture
asoiaf,not_removed,in the beginning the iron throne was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the north just wants to be left alone
asoiaf,not_removed,rhaegar married elia guy
asoiaf,not_removed,not only their relatives but they certainly do
asoiaf,not_removed,i remember reading that some targaryens married velaryons and given roberts relation they must have married a baratheon at some point
asoiaf,not_removed,dany is about to invade kl cersei goes all burn the mall jaime grabs her from behind and chokes her out as she goes limp danys dragonfire accidentally lights up the remaining caches of wildfire beneath the red keep and jaime is taken out
asoiaf,not_removed,aww
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime will die when he kills cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,may i present jaime lannister king slayer the kin slaying king slayer
asoiaf,not_removed,from kins layer to king slayer to queen slayer to queens layer
asoiaf,not_removed,interestingly younger and prettier queen could be dany not maergery
asoiaf,not_removed,i say its the hound that kills her valonquar just refers to younger brother so hound strangles cersei mountain show off cleganbowl reconfirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the method of death is also telling strangulation is normally something seen in a crime of passion tyrion strangled shae because of the personal betrayal i think the fact that the killer will strangle cersei means there is some real personal anger someone wants no needs to see the life leave her tyrion would be matter of fact about killing her he doesnt have the emotional connection to her that he had for shae or that jamie has for her i think the how of her death is one of the most important pieces of information that is overlooked
asoiaf,not_removed,it was more like you will have children he will have or something like that
asoiaf,not_removed,until the final i thought it would twist younger brother to be someone like tommen butthat theory fell out the window
asoiaf,not_removed,i cant imagine how jaime will choke her with one hand though he cant do a onehander cause hes not a big guy like gregor and his golden hand is pretty much useless
asoiaf,not_removed,someone on my facebook feed was very confused about who that old guy that arya killed was this is why we cant have nice things
asoiaf,not_removed,dont wanna sound like stannis but its scene
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but they remember the red wedding as robb and catelyn being murdered by the lannisters
asoiaf,not_removed,that makes sense because jon snow is jaemerystm timetraveling stillborn baby that was lost in that black magic ceremony that was used to try and save drogo edit bran was the one who ushered the soul of daenerys baby through time into the baby jon snow using oaknet
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty sure jon snows real name is jimothy
asoiaf,not_removed,that name is virtually insane
asoiaf,not_removed,his occupation is space cowboy
asoiaf,not_removed,was that a character name from a fire upon the deep
asoiaf,not_removed,she and tyrion are getting along pretty well
asoiaf,not_removed,arya
asoiaf,not_removed,but its a double personality disorder issue and he has no memories of his actions as daenerys so i dont think we can judge him on that
asoiaf,not_removed,with euron you mean
asoiaf,not_removed,he did essentially return from the dead
asoiaf,not_removed,only god i worship
asoiaf,not_removed,not to latvian gods
asoiaf,not_removed,especially on the old man potatobody underneath
asoiaf,not_removed,dude that was a part of the summer al collection designed by lord yeezy quit bein a hater
asoiaf,not_removed,it became pretty apparent when they carved that symbol into loras forehead that he was using faith as a tool of oppression not for atonement
asoiaf,not_removed,the noble need to face justice as much as the small folk do they sat up high judging but not far in justice he does engage in the discipline and fasting and prayer in his repentance
asoiaf,not_removed,he roughed some people up and cut off some hair ned stark chopped a dudes head off because he ran away from a magic ice zombie tywin lannister exterminated an entire family for being insolent aerys burned a man to death because the guys son threatened the prince after kidnapping his sister dany had about a thousand dudes crucified jon snow beheaded a man for telling him to fuck off the high sparrow is the gentlest disciplinarian in westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,like ned stark
asoiaf,not_removed,what did margery exactly do that the sparrow didnt do himself she hung out with sinners so do we all since everyone sins she plot to gain control of the crown so did the sparrow he was arrogant in his understanding of the power and control he had over cersei while claiming humility he made his own beliefs look arbitrary
asoiaf,not_removed,bringing justice in a militant charge to those who flouted the nations faith and who encouraged evil practices should a police officer fear when he enforces the law against criminals
asoiaf,not_removed,you make an excellent point and i honestly agree with your assessment of the hs but i disagree with one aspect i dont think his humility was genuine maybe at first but he started to get a pretty high hand his piety however i think was completely legitimate and believed i think he really thought he was helping people but he did begin to play the game using his position and the faith to remove people from power that he thought were problematic he was clearly beginning to manipulate tommen none of these things are that bad relative to other bad guys but theres an element of hypocrisy and i think thats what people actually hate about the hs its not just that people on the sub dont like organized religion its that we as humans dont like phonies i say this as a practicing episcopalian and fan of the liturgy i did not like the hs he bothered me and it wasnt the religious aspect its the fact that he acted like we wasnt playing the game that he was above the game and that people who played the game were the bad guys when he was in fact deep into the game say what you want about tywin at least he owned what he was theres no hypocrisy there
asoiaf,not_removed,absolutely agree another key point to me the high sparrow had access to a very straightforward route to power in the early offered partnership with cersei but instead pressed ahead with his inquisition this was either ethical consistency or risking it all for a power grab olenna in particular had that very powerful scene in the church where she tried to get candid to unveil the sparrows ambition and she failed i think whats great about the high sparrows story is that it reads perfectly well regardless of the level of cynicism you apply to his motives prophet of the commoner worldboiling extremist or a powerhungry mastermind all of his decisions can be held up and viewed in a different light based on your perspective brilliantly acted as well which helps quite a bit
asoiaf,not_removed,i think because almost everyone playing the game of thrones is a scheming mastermind people think of the high sparrow as using religion as a weapon to elevate himself into power while bringing down everyone else rather than just being genuine everyone readingwatching has become so jaded over the years it is just hard to take the high sparrow at face value even though there really isnt any evidence against him
asoiaf,not_removed,i completely agree i was raised catholic and ill always be a catholic at heart but i lean towards being agnostic too but i dont understand the widespread hatred of religion on this sub religion isnt inherently evil nor are people who pursue a religious existence some religious people are totally backwards but so are people who dont believe in religion and yes the antihomosexual beliefs are backwards to us but in westeros it was outlawed by the laws of the seven cersei is the one who convinced tommen to reinstate the faith militant and shes done far worse things than the hs ever did or sanctioned i think people view the hs through the distorted lens of a hatred towards organized religion and the horror of religious extremism extremism isnt an issue with religion its an issue with people who misinterpret religious texts and use them to promote an agenda of hate the hs was one of my favorite new characters who wasnt hypocritical and really cared about the plight of the common folk the faith militant seemed like a bunch of bullies though
asoiaf,not_removed,for some reason it never really occurred to me that he could be completely genuine after reading your comment i guess it was my own bias but i was always waiting for the curtains to be pulled open and his secret agenda revealed
asoiaf,not_removed,he was a bad guy but felt like a critical piece in making kings landing interesting the homophobia might have been weird but i got over it for the plot it produced
asoiaf,not_removed,we never saw much evidence of this he didnt intentionally ascend to power cersei placed him in a position of power and he believed he was upholding the will of the gods
asoiaf,not_removed,homosexuality and fornication are against the laws of the seven
asoiaf,not_removed,except we know he was incredibly popular among the small folk so he wasnt imposing his will as much as the will of common people who were fed up with getting stepped on
asoiaf,not_removed,he wasnt humble at all he was the height of arrogance forcibly detaining people for arbitrary offenses thats not cool
asoiaf,not_removed,but by that same claim jaime is a much stronger claimant now that hes been booted from the kings guard he can hold titles and lands again making him lord of casterly rock and heir to the throne plus hes a dude
asoiaf,not_removed,plus theres no more baratheons no more starks anywhere near no more tyrells except lady olenna were sort of short on members of great houses in the area as was mentioned at some point by i believe barristan selmy aegon the conqueror didnt take the iron throne because he had a right to it he took it because he could once you sit on it if you can hold it its yours cersei made her opening with wildfire jaime sat on the throne once and willingly stepped off it because ned stark told him to i dont think cersei will step off it for anyone without force
asoiaf,not_removed,bran the builder can we fix it bran the builder yes we can
asoiaf,not_removed,so is brienne of tarth
asoiaf,not_removed,the father sounds more befitting of stannis
asoiaf,not_removed,hah same reason i chose varrys bran varrys confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,wouldnt that make him the crone he cant walk and is wise
asoiaf,not_removed,he no longer suspects tho mel literally told him his parentage in the most operatic way that whole blackwater bay scene
asoiaf,not_removed,edric storm
asoiaf,not_removed,why not both
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree with most of this except the nurturing part i believe cersei was too nurturing if anything its well known how much she loves her children and no one else except herself joff was a psychopath and she nurtured that in him tommen was soft and she did the same a better parent would try to steer them into being more rounded people but she accepted who they were and tried to protect them from their own faults
asoiaf,not_removed,i chalk that up to retarded show writing the books crumpling of cerseis note crying for help was much more in line with new jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,i suppose her vengeance would be best served cold however arya killing jaime now would be as annoying as when marge bulldozes the springfield bordello after everyone decides they love it its a dick move
asoiaf,not_removed,then youd be marked they would pretend to be homies and have a nice dinner and everyone would go home then when ever one goes to sleep they go to all the marked and kill them and rape and pillage you know pilliaging
asoiaf,not_removed,please consider the fact that the writers arent trying to fill the story with foreshadowing how do you know that what evidence do you have that its fact
asoiaf,not_removed,they did figuratively though ceding the raping and reaving
asoiaf,not_removed,that and if she ever found out he was her nephew she would definitely be willing to help
asoiaf,not_removed,he did himself
asoiaf,not_removed,you gotta read the fine print though for the good of the realm only applies if a certain personfamily sits upon the iron throne
asoiaf,not_removed,the show poorly portrays it but varys and illyrio the guy who housed the targaryen twins have been working towards this conquest since the day illyrio was presented with them he was even the one who had the dragon eggs in the first place it was his idea to wed dany to drogo to gain an army and everything illyrio lost control but i am certain that dany managing to regain her stature after the death of drogo is what led varys to leave westeros so that he could confirm it and then keep assisting the targaryens he even says fire and blood and only that in dorne imo hes a targ too and thats why he believes in them so much
asoiaf,not_removed,targaryens stannis fewer mumbling
asoiaf,not_removed,in the show are there any other possible suitors aegon doesnt exist she wouldnt go for sweetrobin ramsay unfortunately just died
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but aegon and torrhen couldnt marry
asoiaf,not_removed,kissed by snow
asoiaf,not_removed,jon bent to his task
asoiaf,not_removed,daaaaaaaym thoros
asoiaf,not_removed,idont know
asoiaf,not_removed,business in the north party in the south
asoiaf,not_removed,it just comes to you naturally when you are dragon born no need to spend years learning it
asoiaf,not_removed,yeezy ygritte taught me
asoiaf,not_removed,jon may be part targaryan but he was raised a northman and the northmen dont approve of incest
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,the last brothersister combo in westeros was probably mad king aerys his sisterwife rhaella
asoiaf,not_removed,incest only exists in some families like the lannisters and the oh well
asoiaf,not_removed,is it not considered incest to marry your aunt dany is sister of rhaegar rhaegar is father of jon jon is nephew of dany
asoiaf,not_removed,bird law in this country is not governed by reason
asoiaf,not_removed,look we can discuss the impact of that move on bird law all day but the fact remains most of the birds would have gotten eaten by the dragon if torren hadnt knelt but like i said it completely changed the way bird law is practiced here in the states no doubt about that no doubt
asoiaf,not_removed,correct in bird culture this is considered a dick move
asoiaf,not_removed,leave sweet d out of this
asoiaf,not_removed,he squanched to the dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,it has been a difficult mating season for king jon
asoiaf,not_removed,heres the thing
asoiaf,not_removed,he married her as at the time of his marriage he had no sister or cousin he could marry eila had some targaryen blood through her ancestors and the martells were commonly married to targaryens to keep them loyal
asoiaf,not_removed,it kind of comes and goes duncan the small was going to be married to a baratheon but ended up giving up his claim on the throne to marry jenny of oldstones a commoner aegon egg himself married for love betha blackwood
asoiaf,not_removed,orys baratheon was aegon the conquerers bastard brother
asoiaf,not_removed,aegon vs youngest daughter married ormund baratheon they had roberts dad steffon then steffon married cassana estermont and made robert the bobert stan the man and renly thedenly
asoiaf,not_removed,iirc the baratheons were originally targ bastards from around the time of conquest i might be wrong on that though
asoiaf,not_removed,burn the mall the prices are too damn high burn the mall burn the macys burn the sarku japan burn the amc theater burn all the fucking iphone repair kiosks
asoiaf,not_removed,or cersei tries to ignite the wildfire jaime tries to stop her frankengregor gets in the way and jaime fights him and kills him with fire cersei is lighting the fuse as jaime is forced to stab her in the back the fuse is already lit however and the wildfire is ignited they die holding each other as they and the entire city is engulfed in wildfire dany and jons armies converge on kl in time to see it light up like the forth of july from a safe distance when the flames go down they enter the charred ruins of kl and we are treated to what dany saw in her vision in the house of the undying
asoiaf,not_removed,i would not be amused if dany accidentally blew up the red keep in a clumsy accident the writings on the wall that the wildfire under the city is gonna fuck shit up but if its like dracarys dracarys dracatchoo oh shit all this wildfire im gonna be pissed
asoiaf,not_removed,i know right but its starting to seem inevitable and ill be probably still be shocked when it happens
asoiaf,not_removed,mayth i presenth jamith lannithter kinth slayer the kinth slayingth kingth slayer
asoiaf,not_removed,im going to guess that after bathing in wildfire margaery is no longer prettier
asoiaf,not_removed,the things cersei held most dear were her children two of which were taken by marg and also her last remaining child after losing them she wouldnt care as much for how much power she has i do believe marg was the younger prettier queen and she has done her task of taking everything from cersei including having the adoration of the people that she never had though i think this might be one of the ideas of grrm to show how prophecies tend to be ambiguous and once made people tend to try and fit its pieces together looking for any link edit typo
asoiaf,not_removed,it was a pretty common theory on here that the younger and prettier queen was always a reference to dany cersei just believed it meant maergery because well she was a younger and extremely beautiful girl who married sons and became queen plus it was obvious that the tyrells were angling for more power
asoiaf,not_removed,i never really thought about that because until recent events margery was doing quite well with taking over
asoiaf,not_removed,i wonder if it could be interpreted as younger sibling because then arya could cross her off the list
asoiaf,not_removed,ooh i like this my hopes for cleganbowl have been renewed ever since they brought the hound back
asoiaf,not_removed,or the hound cuts through the mountain and loses his sword or axe in the process leaving him with just his hands to finish of the mad queen
asoiaf,not_removed,underrated comment
asoiaf,not_removed,a metal hand is pretty effective at crushing a gahtdamn windpipe though
asoiaf,not_removed,seriously its not that hard
asoiaf,not_removed,whoa back up please is this actually a thing please tell you arent just saying that for goofs
asoiaf,not_removed,unrelated but my mother in laws name is kim and i once asked my partner if it was short forand he cut me off and went nope it isnt short for kimothy or anything i made him repeat it like times then died laughing
asoiaf,not_removed,its actually gary
asoiaf,not_removed,no it was steve miller
asoiaf,not_removed,of course a girl has no parents
asoiaf,not_removed,but who is phone
asoiaf,not_removed,who needs sack when only have one potato
asoiaf,not_removed,and those mindless fanatics were just muscle for his agenda reminds me of the story of hypatia and how in the century bishop cyril assembled christian fanatics for his political gain against the governor of the city of alexandria edit actually i wonder if grrm based the high sparrow on him apparently cyril had the title pillar of faith
asoiaf,not_removed,there is justice and there is having an axe to grind the high sparrow had an axe to grind against nobility
asoiaf,not_removed,to be fair the reynes actively tried to usurp the westerlands they werent simply insolent
asoiaf,not_removed,ned stark chopped off a dudes head after he broke an oath one he knew breaking was punishable by death jon snow chopped off a mans head for insubordination and being a cowardly honorless piece of shit the others meh youre justified in saying that they werent justified still though the high sparrow punished for things which as far as we know arent expressly against the laws of the realm loras they are against his personal interpretation of the gods he tortured people for months on end because he didnt like that they fucked men or that they lied to protect their families he may not have been as instantaneously harsh but if you took the integral of his harshness over the time he was harsh it has to match up with some of the others
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but religions is like baaaaaad man
asoiaf,not_removed,ned heard his final words and did his job and followed the law he didnt kill the guy because it was fun the guy saw what he saw jon saw the same thing and didnt run like a bitch gared broke his oath the penalty for leaving the watch is death jon killed soldiers who mutinied against their commanding officer and stabbed him to death best believe most militaries imprison or kill mutineers tywin is an ass though
asoiaf,not_removed,wait who did jon behead and why i dont quite remember that
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean is there anyone that didnt kill someone with discipline also ned thought the guy was bsing about the ice zombie to get out of dying and that he was crazy
asoiaf,not_removed,dany had about a thousand dudes crucified cmon twas only a hundred and sixtythree
asoiaf,not_removed,gentle really what he did was torture plain and simple additionally he refused to actually give anyone a trial he simply brought them in and tortured them the trial he did give them was simply the preordained punishment he had for them beforehand he would torture them until they confessed to whatever he wanted thereby justifying the punishment that he had in mind all along he certainly did well by the poor but those he didnt like he treated them as cruelly as any mad tyrant
asoiaf,not_removed,do i really need to say what unchecked religious zealotry actually looks like
asoiaf,not_removed,roughed some people up continous physical and psychological torture is harmless
asoiaf,not_removed,what did margery exactly do that the sparrow didnt do himself perjury
asoiaf,not_removed,he tortured people did you not see how broken loras was that guy had some serious fucking shit done to him daenerys crucified hundreds of people not knowing if they actually perpetrated a crime stannis burnt his own child at the stake jaime at least in the books threatens to launch an infant out of a catapult at riverrun to break the seige we just saw cersei apparently punish that septa by letting the zombie of the mountain rape her ned was so bound by his honor that he executed some dude for essentially panicking after being the only living human to witness white walkers in thousands of years and we heard in the last episode that jons parentage has been a lie because robert would apparently be so enraged to find out he was lyannas daughter than he would murder him as a child pretty much all of these things are as bad or worse than the torture inflicted by the hs which from what we can see has only consisted of solitary confinement they were all crazed fanatics using violence to punish people they didnt like or who got in their way this could be said of many of the supporters of the starks or the lannisters or especially the people following daenerys im not saying the hs is without faults but i am saying that he gets an inordinate amount of hate for what he has done compared to the rest of the characters i think thats mostly because he is a religious figure
asoiaf,not_removed,you could be entirely right its perfectly possible but i dont think we got to see enough of the high sparrow to know how genuine he was it would have been nice to see his motivations be they sincerely benevolent or not examined a little more
asoiaf,not_removed,he flat out admits this to jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,i think youre reading waaaaay too much into it people dislike antagonists who are selfserving and have a sense of superiority about themselves and their beliefs the hs is incredibly arrogant in a holier than thou sort of way and the fact that he does it on the basis of a fictional religion makes people dislike him i always got the feeling that he was trying to make himself a martyr rather than actually help the poor and disenfranchised
asoiaf,not_removed,its not that they are against religion they are against unchecked religious power how is it in the peoples best interest to torture men who are gay or kill and mutilate men who seek out prostitutes religion is fine until you try to force others to believe in your sky fairies and use brute force and fear to do so
asoiaf,not_removed,to be fair he definitely could be power hungry or have a secret agenda he certainly was making strong aggressive political moves the problem is that as viewers we never got to see enough of him to know if it was a power play or truly a reflection of the will of the people either way it would have been cool to see a little more of his character explored before he went out
asoiaf,not_removed,except in previous seasons you had people like littlefinger making jibes at renly and i believe that before the sparrows even show up margaery tells loras how he needs to be more careful and discreet after she walked in on him with olyver so it seems pretty heavily implied that homophobia is pretty institutionalized even before the sparrows showed up otherwise i would agree with you
asoiaf,not_removed,i disagree the jaime scene sealed it for me when he was basically taunting jaime to attack him but knew he jaime couldnt or wouldnt touch him he knew exactly what he was doing
asoiaf,not_removed,his actions were deliberately designed to manipulate tommen he arrested cersei and margaery leaving tommen alone and vulnerable he arrested and tortured loras to manipulate margaery because he knew margaery could influence tommen once margaery had successfully manipulated tommen all of a sudden her need to perform the walk of shame vanished he apparently lied to margaery about what would happen during lorass trial in order to have loras renounce his claim without any other heirs the claim would go to margaery who the sparrow controlled he doesnt seem to have that same concern with tommen though since he can control tommen and use tommens power as his own hes torturing people in the name of religion to advance his own position
asoiaf,not_removed,says him how many brothels has he busted by the way and that still leaves the torture
asoiaf,not_removed,even if you grant that they are sins and should be punished his trials are still farces both the accused and witnesses are tortured until enough of them confess to get an easy confession in a trial on which he is also judge and jury yeah we know that the people he accused were guilty as charged but he didnt get anywhere near proving it
asoiaf,not_removed,there we go again thinking the lgbt movement has gained traction in westeros maybe we should view it as its own setting instead of through a lens of century progressivism
asoiaf,not_removed,westeros considers the book of the seven to be the law the offences arent really arbitrary you just dont agree to the laws
asoiaf,not_removed,which is why its important to ship him off to help walder frey while cersei makes her move now that the crown is on her head anyone taking it is a challenger to the throne
asoiaf,not_removed,sure she doesnt want her first to be a man of tormunds ah stature
asoiaf,not_removed,but jon is the warden of the north now its befitting
asoiaf,not_removed,i find stannis judgement lacking
asoiaf,not_removed,tormund has dibs cant have jamie go and break his brocode vow now and if jamie sits on his left hand long enough it could be considered the stranger
asoiaf,not_removed,yea i guess cerseis real fault in parenting is she thinks that children only need love i guess in joffreys case he probably needed more discipline to show he cant get away with being an insufferable cunt always tommen needed more hands off approach so he could get bit by a dire wolf etc to toughen him up some myrcella seemed like best raised child an i often wonder if it was because she just had less spokenscreen time to tarnish the image she was also least deserving of dying imo because she just died to have an example setshitty grasp at revenge
asoiaf,not_removed,shes been in bravos she wouldnt know anything about his redemption arc and even if she did her parents are dead by lanister actions she was chased all through the countryside by lanister men on her way back north hes on her list everyone on that list will die
asoiaf,not_removed,thats a stretch it was negotiations
asoiaf,not_removed,we do not sow
asoiaf,not_removed,i read that as moreso a correction of a discrepancy between asha and yara since asha desires reform within the iron islands while yara was mostly seen to be playing within the system
asoiaf,not_removed,by taking power from a crazy bitch then splitting it between himself and reasonable allies yeah he actually wrote his own death warrant
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont interpret it that way i interpret him seeing people like tywin post targ dynasty and kevan as temporary solutions whereas the targaryens or whatever family he supports are permanent solutions
asoiaf,not_removed,ramsay wasnt quite at the level of the main houses at any point anyway and i dont think dany wouldve been that stupid she also probably doesnt see tyrion that way and wouldnt need to marry him to have him as an ally anyway doubt shed go for jaime due to aerys death despite him being largely to blame too im thinking it somewhat unlikely jaime wouldve killed aerys without the wildfire thing already having tyrion theon isnt an option either in the books willas tyrell is an option being lame wouldnt be a huge issue if he rode dragons and being seen as less powerful than the ruling queen may even be a plus garlan tyrell is married quentyn martell is probably dead or at least dying trystane martell remains an option if a bit young but again a marriage with dorne probably isnt necessary to gain them as an ally and for their fealty harry the heir probably isnt a very appealing or necessary match either in effect all signs pretty much point to jon someone whos not actually first in line to one of the kingdoms is probably a better choice but other pros include that hes a capable war commander a targaryen claimant and the north is possibly the hardest kingdom to conquer by force just due to its size compare to dorne so she has the most to gain from an alliance there
asoiaf,not_removed,euron if she loses her fleet
asoiaf,not_removed,jon snow first of his name lord of the dragon cave
asoiaf,not_removed,king of the north in the streets king of the south in the sheets
asoiaf,not_removed,that thing you do with your tongue
asoiaf,not_removed,dude marrying his aunt where else but the south
asoiaf,not_removed,kissed by a rose on a grave then seal comes out with saltwife heidi klum and does a duet with maisie williams for eight minutes of a minute episode followed by minutes of tyrion telling funny drinking game jokes
asoiaf,not_removed,dayyyyyymmmmmmmmmmmdavos
asoiaf,not_removed,you know nothing fred rogers
asoiaf,not_removed,guess he knew a few things after all
asoiaf,not_removed,opinions change when dragons thrones and hot aunts are involved
asoiaf,not_removed,rickard stark brandon ned lyanna and benjens dad married his cousin
asoiaf,not_removed,interestingly most of the ick factor surrounding incest on a practical level has to do with growing up together studies on this both confirm childhood proximity studies done in israeli communes where people who were raised in the collective but were unrelated were not comfortable with ingroup sexual pairings and intriguingly enough suggest that without proximity or knowledge wed be incesting a lot more called genetic sexual attraction separated at birth situations feature it occasionally its true that danaerys is jons aunt but theyre the same age and have never met before so if anything they might be inexplicably attracted to each other unless jon finds out about his parents and takes a serious moral stand
asoiaf,not_removed,but cousins and auntsuncles isnt regarded as incest when cersei openly confessed to sleeping with her cousin lancel it wasnt seen as incest tywin married his cousin the karstark girl who fled to the wall was going to be forced to marry her uncle so obviously that must have been legal
asoiaf,not_removed,starks have had uncleniece marriages before so theres no reason to believe that they consider it wrong
asoiaf,not_removed,my man
asoiaf,not_removed,theon got busy with his fingers
asoiaf,not_removed,and the starks too neds parents were related so jon has both branches covered especially if they tie branches together
asoiaf,not_removed,yes yes it is what backwards place do you live in where this isnt incest west virginia edit httpsenwikipediaorgwikilawsregardingincestintheunitedstates
asoiaf,not_removed,there is no carol there is no pepe silvia
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei was also an option cerseis mother was lady in waiting for the queen even cersei wanted to marry him but the mad king told tywin a man does not marry his heir to his servants daughter
asoiaf,not_removed,egg v had other options but he wanted that blackwood tail
asoiaf,not_removed,allegedly but they get the claim from roberts grandmum
asoiaf,not_removed,and now the house is perilously close to being extinguished
asoiaf,not_removed,yup orys baratheon the og baratheon was rumored to be an illegitimate brother of aegon and his sister wives
asoiaf,not_removed,burn them in their beds baths and beyonds
asoiaf,not_removed,burn the sbarro for fucks sake burn the goddamned sbarro
asoiaf,not_removed,oh my god were having a fire sale
asoiaf,not_removed,burn down hot topic
asoiaf,not_removed,nooo not the sarku
asoiaf,not_removed,they rebuild and rename it ql
asoiaf,not_removed,definitely hotter though
asoiaf,not_removed,most dead
asoiaf,not_removed,search your tinfoil you know it to be true
asoiaf,not_removed,the evidence is all right there
asoiaf,not_removed,jay kay is steve miller
asoiaf,not_removed,swear to no one
asoiaf,not_removed,optimists
asoiaf,not_removed,even the children babies and women they all deserved to die
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly and he didnt enforce those laws equally he only enforced and punished when it suited him remember jaime confessing to sins the high sparrow just shrugged them off as he wasnt served at the time by punishing him the hs used his power in an arbitrary fashion in order to gain power just like any other tyrant
asoiaf,not_removed,torture forced atonement and forced servitude for a cause you dont believe in isnt evil
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the fuck off was referring to janos slynt
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly ned jon they followed a set of rules laws and didnt take pleasure in it the high sparrow followed no given set of rules only those he made up himself and the repercussions to the infractions they werent simply what he had to do according to law they were the punishments that he made up on the spot to serve him best and give him the most power there is a big difference in following rules because of duty and honor and creating all your rules and punishments on the fly in order to gain power while enjoying the use of that power
asoiaf,not_removed,janos slynt shaker of jowls
asoiaf,not_removed,janos slynt because he was an asshole and outright refused a direct order
asoiaf,not_removed,other peoples shitty actions dont discount the hs actions
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre pretty much all awful people imo except maybe jon and three others
asoiaf,not_removed,in defense of ned the man he executed mustve sounded like a madman who is desparately trying to find an excuse for deserting the nw
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly the hs admits he only enforces rules when it serves him he punishes some not others and as i noted in other replies he grants no trials either he locks people up and tortures them until they confess or else grant whatever concession that he needs to elevate his own power this is not a man trying to enforce the law of god its a man trying to elevate himself
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps hes a morally grey character and i believe its intentional i personally enjoy having morally complex characters in the story he wasnt strictly evil and he wasnt completely good seemed like he was just interested in feeding the poor until cersei sought him out and gave him power he never seemed particularly interested in power or wealth or finery but he certainly had an agenda and he was good at manipulating people particularly tommen i didnt love the hs but i enjoyed having such an interesting antagonist in the story and i loved seeing cersei finally get what was coming to her after she had loras and marg imprisoned
asoiaf,not_removed,you might not be looking into it enough stannis is about the most selfrighteous guy in the series and people love him the lannisters tyrion jaime and cersei included all think about as highly of themselves as anyone and they range from being loved to at the very least not being quite as hated as the high sparrow and when the northernerswildings think of themselves as superior to soft southerners it is seen as cool but as soon as the character switches to the high sparrow who is mostly defined by his religion those same attributes are what he is most reviled for
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps im glad that the character was morally ambiguous it makes him more compelling as an antagonist
asoiaf,not_removed,true
asoiaf,not_removed,im not saying the hs is a good guy but there are far worse characters in the world of asoiaf cersei was stupid to put him in a position of power and reinstate the faith militant torture of prisoners had been happening long before the hs had any influence it was commonplace in the black cells and throughout westeros the torture methods sanctioned by the hs was considerably mild compared to the torture sanctioned by tywin in the show and roose and ramsay and torture was happening the black cells before the hs came around whatever qyburn is doing to the stokeworth girl is far worse than anything the hs sanctioned the hs didnt invent torture yes hes an antagonist but hes a morally grey one as far as antagonists go
asoiaf,not_removed,they busted up littlefingers brothels so i would imagine that others got the same treatment
asoiaf,not_removed,westeros considers the book of the seven to be the law is then even particularly true im sure theres some overlap of course but plenty of people dont worship the seven and ive found westeros to be pretty religiously inclusive than our world was eg the northerners are fine with saying swearing things before the old gods and the new and neither side considers the others to be heretics
asoiaf,not_removed,it was tommen that shipped jaime off
asoiaf,not_removed,har
asoiaf,not_removed,ahheemmm dakingindanorf
asoiaf,not_removed,i accept your defeat
asoiaf,not_removed,actually yeah youre more right negotiating their independence with a compromise whereas jon may cede the north back to her i dont think he will though assuming tyrion acts as an intermediary and dany finds out about jons parentage i personally hope they have a sorta dual targaryen rule
asoiaf,not_removed,master of eating peaches
asoiaf,not_removed,stark in the streets wildling in the sheets
asoiaf,not_removed,and then tyrion gets some jean shorts to give to jon snow thank you for your servicein the nights watch
asoiaf,not_removed,cuts to robert waking up fuckk what a dream im never drinking again
asoiaf,not_removed,didnt you know seals voice makes wolves insanely violent
asoiaf,not_removed,im kind of hoping jon and daenerys get it on and then they find out hes her nephew i hope these past five or seven if your british books have all been just a lead up to the biggest oh damn i fucked up incest joke in literature
asoiaf,not_removed,cousin once removed not anywhere near as close as aunt or first cousin besides the targaryans are so jumbled up from generations of incest jon and dany might as well be siblings im surprised dany doesnt have an extra eye or something
asoiaf,not_removed,the thing is that two main theories that are incest related are jon x dany and jon x sansa with dany the issue i have is that the targaryan line is so riddled with incest that jon and dany might as well be siblings obviously the people in asoiaf dont know that but we do which is why its weird that so many people are encouraging it with sansa its less a genetic issue more a family one theyve known each other as half siblings fr their while lives finding out it isnt true wont erase the taboo on top of that jon and sansa have never shown any real affection for each other its not as if finding out that theyre not relatednis going to result in anything but the main issue i have is that people say theyre made for each other or theyll fall in love this isnt a disney movie or twilight if a marriage were ever going to happen i would be a political one and even that would be pointless with danys infertility
asoiaf,not_removed,i am reminded of the couple who got married both having been adopted decided to find out who their parents are only to find out they had the same parents
asoiaf,not_removed,um and theres jaime and cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,no they werent proof
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty much every country to ever exist in medieval eras
asoiaf,not_removed,could be eastern kentucky
asoiaf,not_removed,he says is it not not it is not
asoiaf,not_removed,i think we can come to the conclusion that aerys was in general a massive cunt who thought that because he had silver hair he was immune to a sword in the tummy lpt silver hair doesnt make you immune to being stabbed times in the chest
asoiaf,not_removed,the house is extinguished in the show but we have two baratheons left in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,right thought so
asoiaf,not_removed,i lost it at this one
asoiaf,not_removed,spare the cinnabun
asoiaf,not_removed,the high sbarro
asoiaf,not_removed,oh my god were having a fire sale thank you for the memory
asoiaf,not_removed,dakingofdafoil
asoiaf,not_removed,you want a war in years kill the fathers you want peace kill the families its cold but given how important family dynasty in westeros is its also the smart decision if youre looking to solidify your familys power discourage future insolents and ultimately avoid more bloodshed
asoiaf,not_removed,by westerosi standards of justice yes
asoiaf,not_removed,in all fairness the torture didnt seem that extreme the worst thing i can remember seeing is the walk of atonement and lets be real the sparrows didnt make that awful the people did if it werent for peasants itching to tell the royals to screw off thatd of been a nude jaunt first thing cersei does when she has whats her face is waterboard her and leave her in the hands of a torturing raping murder zombie also the crown is severely in debt the realm is bled and many of the smallfolk no longer have money or food stores because of the war and the maesters say the worst winter in years is coming in a world where winters last several years if you firmly believed in the gods and that they were what was best for the realm you might be willing to rough up a couple aristocrats that were all guilty as fuck of their alleged crimes to try and save tens of thousands meanwhile cersei like i said leaves whatsherface with the murder zombie and kills hundreds if not thousands basically to save her own skin lets be real here tommen probably couldnt be more safe the faith has every reason to keep him king the people follow the faith and with tommen their alliance with the tyrells was secure even if tommen hadnt jumped out a window his situation was worse with all his allies dead in terms of being a bad person the high sparrow based purely on deeds anything else in conjecture as theres no proof of ulterior motives is about as bad a person as jon snow twice jon snow has executed people now for breaking the rules disobeyingmurdering him the high sparrow punished people for breaking the laws of the gods and we can be fairly sure he didnt do any punishment that wasnt already laid out by his religion
asoiaf,not_removed,what slynt did was almost as bad open insubordination to the commanding officer sows the sort of thinking that leads to things like mutiny its punished pretty severely even in the modern military i mean not lop your head off severely but it could get you thrown in jail depending on the circumstances
asoiaf,not_removed,maker of puddles
asoiaf,not_removed,i never said that was the case im simply saying that other characters get hated on a lot less for a lot more and the difference is probably the fact that the hs is a religious figure and a lot of people have inherent biases against religion
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i fail to see how dany being a hypocritical warlord makes the hs less of a dick
asoiaf,not_removed,littlefingers brothels lord baelishs establishment fixed it now you just need an elbow to the face
asoiaf,not_removed,i think that was because the previous high septon was profaning the gods by choosing between girls and referring to them each as one of the seven did they bust up brothels at any point for the sake of busting up brothels
asoiaf,not_removed,theyll probably marry but will die and tyrion will be king since hes married to sansa and shell be next in line
asoiaf,not_removed,i disagree with the idea that jon will cede the north back to anyone for a number of reasons the foremost of which being the idea that there wont likely be much left of the seven kingdoms as we know them by the time the great war is over most of the ancient houses great and lesser have been utterly decimated by the the north is being irrevocably changed by the grudging acceptance of the wildlings the effective end of the nights watch the likely invasion of the others andor the possible destruction of the wall kings landing is likely to be destroyed by cersei a dragon euron the dothraki the others or a combination of events not to mention weve been told this winter is expected to last maybe a decade so we have no way of knowing even where well be when the war and story end respectively assuming we even get a glimpse of what life and governance will be like postwar ive seen it suggested that our story might be a fantasy retelling of the transition from feudalism to the early state maybe rather than dany returning to essos rebuilding valeryia or any of the other possible ends proposed along the way she rules in a new capital harrenhall the gods eye over all of westeros as aegon once saw it not seven kingdoms but one land
asoiaf,not_removed,what exactly was the compromise of theon an asha ok we give you our fleet and in returnscissoring action between dany and asha dont see what they gained except euron wont kill them as easily
asoiaf,not_removed,and fucker of kings
asoiaf,not_removed,youre a talker listening to talkers makes me thirsty
asoiaf,not_removed,harbinger of cleganebowl first of his hype
asoiaf,not_removed,candied plumes from braavos btw since when does android autocorrect asoiaf names correctly
asoiaf,not_removed,stark in the streets targaryen between the sheets
asoiaf,not_removed,pup in the streets wolf in the sheets
asoiaf,not_removed,theres nowhere near the budget for both of those to be on screen together
asoiaf,not_removed,ive made a huge mistake
asoiaf,not_removed,this is gonna lead to a joe dirt moment
asoiaf,not_removed,kind of like an oedipus thing but without the eye gouging
asoiaf,not_removed,lonely island starts playing and faded to black damn i fucked my aunt
asoiaf,not_removed,howd the brits get two more books than us did grrm write a dr who asoiaf crossover
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre split up further in britain
asoiaf,not_removed,it doesnt matter much if dany is barren now no incest babies no incest problem
asoiaf,not_removed,how i met your incestuous mother
asoiaf,not_removed,uhm oedipus rex
asoiaf,not_removed,she has a whispering eye
asoiaf,not_removed,a previous stark married his neice
asoiaf,not_removed,do you know what a cousin once removed is a cousin once removed is the child of your first cousin thats pretty gross
asoiaf,not_removed,didnt one of the karstarks try to marry his niece who was the rightful heir to karhold also tywin married his cousin
asoiaf,not_removed,serena stark had four children with her uncle edric stark and her sister sansa stark was married to her uncle jonnel stark
asoiaf,not_removed,considering danerys had a miscarriage at the end of adwd shes probably not infertile jon x danerys would be acceptable to the commoners and dany and jon would probably be able to live with it if it was necessary jon x sansa while genetically healthier than a targ union would activate the raised together ick factor somewhat though catelyn and sansa ensured that jon and sansa didnt view themselves as full siblings or spend much time together
asoiaf,not_removed,not to mention that alleged original planned storyline about jon and arya
asoiaf,not_removed,that just sounds like propaganda from a covetous uncle to me
asoiaf,not_removed,i often look to the middle east as an exemplar of marriage laws and customs
asoiaf,not_removed,serena stark had four children with her uncle edric stark and her sister sansa stark was married to her uncle jonnel stark uncleniece and auntnephew are fine in westeros and also in many parts of the modern world like ny state
asoiaf,not_removed,in rural england no one would really care if you married your cousin
asoiaf,not_removed,you could actually marry your first cousin in more states than gay marry before the supreme court ruling
asoiaf,not_removed,some countries and some states
asoiaf,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikifamilytreeofhousestark
asoiaf,not_removed,best possible answer
asoiaf,not_removed,european royals were fucking their cousins on an industrial scale up until about a century ago
asoiaf,not_removed,caaaaaaaaaaaarl that kills people
asoiaf,not_removed,he may have been a cunt about it the servants daughter comment was just twisting the knife in the wound but can you blame him for thinking that by giving in to tywin on this matter he was giving far too much power to the lannisters and for that matter to his own son i mean he grew paranoid and cruel beyond reason but mad as he was he was not wrong in that people were conspiring against him
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope we finish with at least one alive house baratheon is awesome
asoiaf,not_removed,saul must live
asoiaf,not_removed,well by westerosi standards the high sparrow was progressive then
asoiaf,not_removed,oh i agree im just pointing out that open mutiny and stabbing of the lord commander wasnt the least serious thing he executed someone for
asoiaf,not_removed,kingindastoreroom
asoiaf,not_removed,the point isnt that one or the other is more or less dickish its that many characters gets a free pass for the horrible shit they do and the high sparrow doesnt
asoiaf,not_removed,ohhhhhh shit i really like that thatd pissssss baelish off and arya as lord of winterell pls pls pls
asoiaf,not_removed,the marriage doesnt count because tyrion didnt bed her its why lf gotta way with marrying her off to ramsey
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion and sansa never consummated their marriage and since she was rewed to ramsey i think tyrion can consider his marriage enulled
asoiaf,not_removed,is that marriage valid since he was exiled
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess jon is getting it at both sides then
asoiaf,not_removed,and rapist of clean sworded corpses
asoiaf,not_removed,btw since when does android autocorrect asoiaf names correctly since it started crowdsourcing indexing autocorrect results the same way it does google search results
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think a wolf will sit on bobby monaghans shoulders
asoiaf,not_removed,one will be a beautifully rendered model and the other will look like that show reboot
asoiaf,not_removed,well they did make out
asoiaf,not_removed,how do we know they didnt
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,youre my aunty youre my aunty
asoiaf,not_removed,dany no jon my brothers name was viserys jon itsits just less hot now
asoiaf,not_removed,you could say he has a gods wood im sorry but the first thing i thought was i bet every guy can tell you exactly how confused they were the first time they heard a queef
asoiaf,not_removed,how is it more gross than the accepted first cousin marriage are you assuming that there is a large age discrepancy there doesnt need to be if a pair of siblings have a large age discrepancy and have children at different points in their lives you can get to the scenario where your cousin once removed is your age i had a friend who was younger than his nephew and i have a second cousin who is old enough to be my grandmother
asoiaf,not_removed,gross because you think its close ties or because you think theres an age difference two cousins dont have to be the same age so one cousins child may be about the other cousins age anyway the limit for whats too close for marrying goes at about first cousins in most western countries its legal to marry your first cousin and its not considered incest while some countries and about half the states in the us dont allow it note that two cousins share about of their genes and the risk of birth defects for children born to cousins is found to be or less the normal risk for any child is this is the reason that many western countries allow marriage between first cousins the slight increase in risk is considered negligible the problem with inbreeding historically in cultures with large rates of cousin marriages is that if they are accumulated over time the risk increases so thats a good rule of thumb one cousinmarriage is okay but there shouldnt be consecutive ones down the generations and cousins once removed are of course only half as closely related as cousins are making it not a problem at all
asoiaf,not_removed,not infertile maybe but i thought it was implied that she could never have another child the whole point of a political marriage i joining the bloodlines but there no point in that if she cant have children and theres no point in joining bloodlines with jon if the bloodline is already joined same goes for sansa theres no point in it either way most people arent even talking about political marriage theyre insisting that it would be a genuine mutually loving relationship out of nowhere this is asoiaf not disney
asoiaf,not_removed,kiss his shiny metal ass
asoiaf,not_removed,a modern utopia to be copied
asoiaf,not_removed,my tummy had the rumblies that only hands would satisfy
asoiaf,not_removed,nah arya dies from not ever being careful and bran as the three eyed raven become lord of winterfell sam comes back and becomes hand to the king
asoiaf,not_removed,its her name i need not her honor roose bolton to littlefinger giving sansa the little finger
asoiaf,not_removed,he can consider it but why would he he can just say they did it and she can agree he can also say she was kidnapped and forced into marriage she can agree boom done deal king and queen
asoiaf,not_removed,one of his best lines god damn it
asoiaf,not_removed,not just bloodlines though kingdoms too kingdom in the north and the south essentially
asoiaf,not_removed,they gave sapochnik a block of marble and told him to make a sculpture they gave mylod a pile of shit and told him to make a sculpture im not going to applaud sapochnik for making the highlights of the series good nor look down upon mylod for not making the most boring parts of the series uninteresting
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think we could raise enough money to get him to even consider abandoning whatever the movie people are throwing at him
asoiaf,not_removed,why are people gonna cancel subscriptions and not buy merch no then why would that change it we may never see gendry again at this point i have no idea what relevancy this has to anything or why people care
asoiaf,not_removed,i actually liked the broken man am i in the minority
asoiaf,not_removed,id sign
asoiaf,not_removed,no thanks i really enjoyed the broken man i did find the head roll from waif a bit cringey but the episode itself was solid
asoiaf,not_removed,i think if this was the case we would get jamie refelcting on not knowing why he did it but he never questions it he even says the things i do for love
asoiaf,not_removed,the first chapters of agot are almost identical to the ones from the original plot of when asoiaf was going to be a trilogy and well the story was a lot different you can read it here httpwatchersonthewallcomgeorgerrmartinsoriginalplangamethrones as you can see jaime was an asshole even more than joffrey or ramsay the late one probably didnt even exist in that moment thats why jaime appears such an imbecil in agot especially at the begining and then he is more pleasant character in asos and affc
asoiaf,not_removed,i remember reading somewhere that blood raven somehow influenced brans fall in order to begin his journey north to find the one eyed crow
asoiaf,not_removed,in the books bran does get a glimpse at what happened so maybe the show will show it as well
asoiaf,not_removed,i understand that but when weve seen bran have an effect on the past it isnt like people understand his presence so could jamie just think it is his inner voice it just seems like a perfect circle
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,yawn sure lets call something incoherent plotting when any spoilers out there only tell you the big moments of the season and none of the smaller plot building scenes of dialogue and character that lead up to these big scenes sure we will just judge a full season on potential spoilers that do nothing to tell us about all the other scenes that will fill up hours or so of screentime and well just ignore the fact that some of it sounds pretty interesting and actually contains elements of what people expect to happen in the next two books but since its happening on the show first it must be fan fiction
asoiaf,not_removed,what was wrong with theon being beaten up for being a coward who screwed up his country
asoiaf,not_removed,rasoiafcirclejerk
asoiaf,not_removed,cry me a river so i can row my boat like gendry first we dont know if the leak is true yet going off a few points set photos have corroborated is the pinnacle of idiocy second even if they leak is true its a limited set of information and does not explain the circumstances third even if the leaks are false and the season is the single greatest piece of television ever made you will still hate it so i am wasting my breath
asoiaf,not_removed,season spoilers seriously sucked ass and most people hoped they would be fake and were already calling it the worst season of the series yet i believe it was the second or third best season of the show there were a lot of great scenes cotf creating the ww tower of joy hodor and episode were among the best of the show sure some things didnt make sense but whatever
asoiaf,not_removed,settle down david
asoiaf,not_removed,this guy gets it
asoiaf,not_removed,thats because over time every fandom will convince themselves something stupid made sense and was good thats how spoilers everyone agrees are awful get excused left and right when they turn out to be true thats how stuff that is ridiculous like in the finale is called the best episode of the show when it doesnt make the least bit of sense and at the end of the day all game of thrones has to do is look good no one cares that scenes characters and entire plotlines make no sense at all if it just looks pretty and has good music
asoiaf,not_removed,lorde knows being an emmy award winning writer and married to amanda peet would be pretty high on most peoples wish i was list but in all seriousness since we cant actually talk about it in detail here because its not a spoilers infinite thread everything in the spoilers is logical continuation of the show the show will look great people will love more of it than parts they dislike people will be wowed theyll laugh theyll cry just like past seasons and well be back here next summer looking for final season spoilers and possibly even madder book still hasnt come out
asoiaf,not_removed,he is making fun of you
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed i have a lot of issues w the show but ill be watching
asoiaf,not_removed,oh no if the plot is true it is going to make the reaction to sansas rape look tame
asoiaf,not_removed,what do you mean i thought he was totally serious about jackingit to the broken man speech wtf man you think i didnt catch the dripping sarcasm of his original post the entire post of mine was tongueincheek and i was trying to lighten things up a bit but apparently people are humorless dicks round these parts
asoiaf,not_removed,this is going to sound crazy but if you get a chance try it if youre bored andor have free time go watch a reaction video on youtube for episode and and see how normal fans react to the show for me seeing their reactions to certain moments really reminded me how while it isnt what the books would do this is why these decisions are made even if it isnt what i want to happen or what i think should have happen
asoiaf,not_removed,i disagree we cant be specific but as someone who is probably closer to the general population view of the series i think the stuff sounds pretty good i do think some of it will feel a bit rushed due to episodes but once thes detail scget filled in itll go over mostly well on this subreddit well if book hasnt come out by the time the season ends some people will hate it all regardless of course it wont please everyone everyone has a version of what they want the show to be and what they want to happen in the books in their head and if the season does allow itself to follow tropes before seeing what they do with those tropes in sure some people will rip it apart
asoiaf,not_removed,speaking for myself the part i wasnt super thrilled about in your post is the rather large assumption you are making about the leaks being real
asoiaf,not_removed,that makes a lot of sense to me will do the tropes exist for a reason i suppose
asoiaf,not_removed,i am actually a defender of the tv series there is a difference between the books and tv shows because they are different mediums however i cannot defend what has come out about this season not because the plot is so hokey and makes so many characters look really bad i dont think that this will go over with even non book readers because of how certain pretty popular characters act and what happens to them and i read the spoilers prior to season finale and found them to be pleasing i thoroughly enjoyed the sapochnik episodes especially winds of winter which i thought was beautifully written and well directed
asoiaf,not_removed,fair enough cheers mate
asoiaf,not_removed,tropes can be fine as long as they are done well for example the vale arrival was done well would i have preferred manderly showing up there too sure but the scene isnt just about the vale showing up its about sansa going to get them because she doesnt think jon will win theres also a bit of subversion since we know littlefinger isnt there out of the kindness of his heart
asoiaf,not_removed,you can go back through yourself if you want to shouldnt be hard to figure out last time he went this long was last june when he went to europe for two weeks its two weeks as of today but he was at worldcon two weekends ago and bubonicon last weekend he probably didnt get much done during the week while he was home so hes probably saving it up for one big post this week
asoiaf,not_removed,i did like how they gave a small house and how the big characters treat but i did not like how you cant change the outcome
asoiaf,not_removed,where any news would be posted spoiler nothing significant posted yet im pretty eager for the next season but not holding my breath
asoiaf,not_removed,same here enjoyed it up until the last episode and then realized how pointless every decision ended up being
asoiaf,not_removed,well its nice seeing the effects of on a lower level and expanding on a relatively minor house but there are still oddities like the position of sentinel castellan and masteratarms the geography is a bit weird the whitehills claim to have been bannermen to the boltons for centuries but highpoint is in the wrong place more mountain clan land also saying the forresters have been around for generations we hear this house began years ago and the oldest house seems to be the starks at years small details but annoying from a worldbuilding perspective
asoiaf,not_removed,i read an interview with telltale which was advertised as an update on the part release and they he talked about how part was written with the larger story in mind and was mostly focused on setting things up for the future which is exciting to think what will be coming out but unfortunately made alot of decisions feel pointless because we havent been able to see all of the repercussions yet i know they were also working with hbo when writing so they may have been forced to limit certain aspects of the game to align with where the story was up until that point in the show fingers crossed
asoiaf,not_removed,edmure son would inherit riverrun no matter what his child would bind house frey and house tully together also since he is being raised by lannisters its most likely he will be loyal to the crown only thing is we domt know for sure that roslins child would be a boy and if it is then edmure is a dead man
asoiaf,not_removed,trying to win over the riverlands acceptance there may come a time when the lannisters or whomever is in charge raise edmure tullys son as lord of riverrun are the tullys really so loved in the riverlands it is the youngerst line among the liege lords seem like the riverlanders have never felt so intense about their lieges like the northerns feel to the starks i dont think they would object that much if after the war the it comes with peace and a new family to rule them
asoiaf,not_removed,i just want that edmure and roslin be allowed to be happy at some point edmure was willing to die by ser ilyns sword but decided to live just for the thin hope of seeing his wife and child again and had to give away his home to do so roslin pregnant at the twins prays for a girl to help secure her husbands safety fearing that if a son is born lord walder will execute edmure
asoiaf,not_removed,roslin is too far out of the succession
asoiaf,not_removed,no hes not since jaime released all of the tully garrison and sent edmure away from the freys
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps not to the extent of the starks but they are liked the smallfolk are probwb and antifrey so perhaps are still protully by default
asoiaf,not_removed,i get the feeling theyre popular they led the rebellion against the iron born during aegons conquest and have ruled well since and theyve been liege lords for as long as the baratheons or tyrells and their house is much older than both of them
asoiaf,not_removed,i didnt really think of it that way they do kind of have the rich family in an movie kind of feel but they might make an exception for edmure who did try to protect his people
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah no one likes them theyre loser when it comes down to it
asoiaf,not_removed,thats why its fortunate that edmure is now jamies captive and not the freys jamie at least intends to keep edmure alive son or daughter
asoiaf,not_removed,while its true shes waaaay waaaaay waaaay down the line i feel they may make an exception for her child judt for experience
asoiaf,not_removed,yes edmures son is heir to riverrun after edmure edmure remains lord of riverrunthat is why jamie had to send him in to the castle to compel the garrison to lay down their arms
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean edmure isnt a dead man if his son is male
asoiaf,not_removed,huh a son is always male lol and edmure probably is a dead man walking because he has a son that the freys control for now
asoiaf,not_removed,damn far too young an age to die rip
asoiaf,not_removed,oh thats sad first aemon and now him rip
asoiaf,not_removed,sadly being very tall usually ends with an early death the heart isnt made to support someone who is so tall takes a large toll on it
asoiaf,not_removed,remindme june learn how to speak high valyrian so your friends can make fun of you for being a nerd
asoiaf,not_removed,im a fluent speaker of esperanto and even i think a high valyrian course is a bit ridiculous
asoiaf,not_removed,remindme june now were talking
asoiaf,not_removed,the only other completed constructed language on duolingo is esperanto pretty sure duolingo offers klingon too edit nevermind it apparently hasnt been implemented
asoiaf,not_removed,so are there any resources yet or in production for learning dothraki
asoiaf,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of june to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
asoiaf,not_removed,dont forget to send your friends a reminder too
asoiaf,not_removed,id make that or so new languages on duolingo are excruciatingly slow
asoiaf,not_removed,you mean like elvish i tried to learn it once
asoiaf,not_removed,like the old tongue
asoiaf,not_removed,the real lpt is always in the comments
asoiaf,not_removed,how do you test your fluency with no native speakers around
asoiaf,not_removed,the course isnt completed yet
asoiaf,not_removed,nope its been in the in construction phase with no progress made for maybe a year or more its likely been abandoned
asoiaf,not_removed,theres a book you can buy but i dont know how in depth it is
asoiaf,not_removed,fortunately this sub is well versed in long waits for asoiaf material
asoiaf,not_removed,ill add another two or three months if its not out by then
asoiaf,not_removed,real use for both in most cases would probably be around zero til that foreign countries are as imaginary as essos far from me to say what people should do with their free time but there are many situations where knowing a real foreign language can be useful like you know traveling to a continent that almost exclusively speaks spanish for instance either way duolingo is just a first step towards learning a language its basically a test to see if youre really interested in it speaking from experience the only thing you gain from it is forming some very basic vocabulary youll need proper classes to get a grasp of the grammar as even the easy languages still have numerous rules youll most likely need help with not to mention that with most languages you can have passive exposure via music movies tv which further helps with vocabulary and solidifying the rules youve gotten familiar with by recognizing patterns in use which is something youll have a hard time obtaining with a fictional language again learning any foreign language is praiseworthy but lets not get ahead of ourselves some have very real use
asoiaf,not_removed,there actually are native speakers and other nonnatives who have learned it to a fluent level there is a recognised exam you can take that judges you according to the common european framework of reference for languages i passed it at level this summer in esperanto
asoiaf,not_removed,well ill be galdanged good for you what does one do with that
asoiaf,not_removed,well i dont need it for a job it was more for personal development although im now working in france with an esperanto association so i use it on a daily basis
asoiaf,not_removed,i get the personal development angle i already know a few languages and im learning turkish presently for me its about being able to talk to certain persons and read researchwritingsnews from other times and places what does an esperanto assoc do
asoiaf,not_removed,for me its about being able to talk to certain persons and read researchwritingsnews from other times and places i use esperanto for the same talking to people reading listening to music having fun etc what does an esperanto assoc do generally promotes the language we have stalls at events run courses teaching esperanto organise talks and events etc
asoiaf,not_removed,why would there be a maester maesters are assigned to a castle or else remain at the citadel the only ones we see away are nonmaesters like haldon and qyburn the tower of joy was a derelict abandoned outpost being used to house the crown prince and his mistress who were being hunted by rebel forces no reason to need a maester
asoiaf,not_removed,there was something jarring about watching ned instinctively asking the midwife to fetch a maester question combined with lyannas acceptance of her inevitable death that made me wonder for the first time if rhaegar might have actually abducted her for the sake of prophecy if you ask me the only thing that rhaegar cared about this whole time was the child hed have with lyanna everything else was expendable even lyanna herself the prophecy came before everything remember that his whole pursuit of her was tied to him wanting to realize the three heads of the dragon part of his master plan where aegon would be the centrepiece as tptwp and heir to the throne all he needed was that third child and im guessing he was hoping for a visenya to complete the trio i personally think that if elia were healthy lyanna wouldnt have been dragged into this whole thing to begin with this is based on this passage from jon conningtons chapter in adwd after the birth of princess rhaenys her mother had been bedridden for half a year and prince aegons birth had almost been the death of her she would bear no more children the maesters told prince rhaegar afterward
asoiaf,not_removed,its a complicated situation people always forget that rhaegar whispers lyannas name right before he dies so yes you could say she was pretty important to him not just the baby the thing is he probably tought he would be able to come back before the baby borns despite all the prophecy stuff he really believed he would come back to that tower
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah im increasingly thinking this is more likely after rewatching i knew elia couldnt have more kids but the lack of attention to lyanna makes it seem even more prophecy obsessed than i first thought will have to start chipping away at my romantic rhaegarlyanna narrative i still think she was probably attracted to him and perhaps even went with him willingly but more and more i think the prophecy obsession added a darker note to their relationship it must have changed it over time i wonder if we will ever get the full story in the books i hope we do
asoiaf,not_removed,well rhaegar did know she was pregnant it would make sense to him take one of the maesters from kings landing if there were someone other than pycelle there were multiple maesters there during tyrions sojourn so maybe rhaegar could have brought one if there were some at the time
asoiaf,not_removed,thats right good point i forgot he whispered her name i wish we had more on the battle of the trident too this adds another wrinkle to it for all we know jon might have been born prematurely could account for the difficult birth and rhaegar not making more preparations for it
asoiaf,not_removed,yes exactly that sorry i didnt clarify earlier didnt expect toj to have one just thought rhaegar might have arranged for one to be there for the delivery given the importance of the birth or at the very least a full team of midwives especially since elia was bedridden for months after rhaenys birth and almost died after aegons feels like something he might have anticipated seems a bit odd or just a possible blind spot in the plot
asoiaf,not_removed,everything about rhaegar is hazy and thats the power of the character robert killed him i know but bobby b himself didnt got past the first book and five books later we are still hearing about rhaegar theres must be a good reason for that in the passages we can clearly see rhaegar is trying to fulfill or rather trying to understand certain prophecies i dont like when people say rhaegar and lyanna loved each other if they did well good for them but that itself is extremely confusing barristan once said that he though rhaegar was unable to love because of his sense of doom yet we all know what he did at the tourney in harenhall he crowned lyanna and george confirmed that it was her name he whispers before dying lets not forget the kotlt story for me at least everything looks strange i dont think he made the tourney so he could charm lyanna or something like that most people tend to think it needs to be one way or another or he either loved her or was trying to fulfill a prophecy what if it was both i dont know how that would work really but this is george rr martin we are talking about at the very end if turns out jon was also a trueborndont know how that would happen as well i wouldnt be surprised still the show at least made it clear in the previously on that rhaegar kidnapped and raped her if thats what they want us to think is very sad indeed especially becacuse theres just episodes left i say theres no chance we will ever see rhaegar lets hope george will keep his word and reveal all the robertrhaegar stuff as he once said
asoiaf,not_removed,i have read analysis such as this before and it makes sense based on our science however we are in grrms world where certain characteristics are fixed genetically and run true consistently baratheons are big and black hair and so on preston jacobs tried to do a series on targaryen genetics and its implications on dragon hatching it did not work out daenerys could not be a dragon hatcher using his rules grrm has said his readership sometimes overthinks his books i think application of strict genetic rules is one of those situations
asoiaf,not_removed,jon may be a little more inbreed than that due to his blackwood ancestry jons greatgrandfather was son of melantha blackwood and rhaegars great grandmother was betha blackwood as both melantha and betha were alive during the ac they could be as close as sisters or as far as nth cousins but the principle of narrative causality tells me they were closely related
asoiaf,not_removed,a question would be how much the negative effects of inbreeding diminish as you jump generations for example jons father is heavily inbred but lyanna is not only not inbred herself but rhaegar and lyanna have almost zero genetic overlap joffrey on the other hand has parents who are twins and grandparents who are cousins wow how interesting that joff tommen and myrcella have only two grandparents just thought of that for the first time
asoiaf,not_removed,how inbred would aegon vi be if he is who he claims to be
asoiaf,not_removed,good read i havent seen the science behind inbreeding expressed that way before i know someone else said that asoiaf might not apply genetics the same way our world does but its quite interesting to see this so you could apply this to real world monarchies that were notorious for marrying into one another
asoiaf,not_removed,daenerys is inbred joffrey is inbred and jon is inbred its amazing they dont suffer from more physical and mental issues than they do is cruelty due to inbreeding even a real thing the story is full of complete dickwads whithout a drop of dragonblood i always took it as a lie all the other jackass nobles told themselves in order to ignore their own malice claiming the moral high ground via shaky technicality
asoiaf,not_removed,great post
asoiaf,not_removed,thats fair i was more curious as to how much former targaryen inbreeding would carry down to dany
asoiaf,not_removed,thats probably true the figures i give are more of an at least this inbred based on what we know for certain all the numbers should probably be higher do to constant marriages between highborn families
asoiaf,not_removed,good question do we know how many generations above elia martell was prince maron who married daenerys daeron iis sister we just dont know enough about the martell family to say for sure
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont see why you couldnt use it for real world monarchs or anyone else
asoiaf,not_removed,well joffrey doesnt have any targaryen heritage and is a monster im not sure i know what youre trying to get at exactly though i never brought up cruelty when i said mental issues i meant more like being mentally challenged or some disorder
asoiaf,not_removed,dany should have genetic issues even when you include the reset outcroppings at maekar and aegon v the jaehaerys and aerys inbreeding would certainly cause a rapid accumulation of dangerous recessives traits daenerys is dangerously unfit genetically the only people that come close in the story are crasters kids we can safely assume gillys mother is a first generation daughter of craster so craster impregnated his daughter and grand daughter
asoiaf,not_removed,some people talk about targaryen madness and attribute it to inbreeding joffrey is an example for a mad ruler without targaryen heritage while ramsay is one without excessive inbreeding i would rather blame corruption due to unchecked power for their behaviour but of course no lord has interest in questioning the system that keeps them in power so they use targaryen madness as an excuse
asoiaf,not_removed,inbreeding can make recessive genes expressed more frequently it does not create bad recessive genes if the targaryens have near immaculate genetics they may not be unfit genetically clearly this isnt the case as we see the madness is a flip of the coin so some recessive traits are becoming more frequent another thought is that with natural selection a lot of the weaker members of the family did not contribute to the line by dying before inbreeding all said i dont think we have that many with pure perfect genes so dont try inbreeding at home
asoiaf,not_removed,only if you think valyrian people are affected by things like inbreed problems i remember seeing that valyrian were immune to most diseases
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree with that
asoiaf,not_removed,you also have tommen and myrcella with the exact same inbred parents that seem to be pretty nice and sane people although insanity might be genetic i think joffreys cruelty is unique to him and probably more a result of being brought up as the golden boy who could do no wrong as well as basically the source of all of cerseis happiness pre tommen and myrcella
asoiaf,not_removed,thats not how genetics works someone with perfect genes is still vulnerable to genetic mutations
asoiaf,not_removed,the book evidence is against this claim many targ women have high incidences of miscarriageabnormal childrenscales wings tails etc in addition the line has a strong trend towards mental instability and meglomania
asoiaf,not_removed,i think daenarys herself stated that she never remembered viserys or herself being sick and that he claimed it was the dragon bloods privilege
asoiaf,not_removed,daenerys isnt exactly an authority on this topic given her brief knowledge of her own ancestry which btw is heavily biased and more importantly learned through viserys who we all know was way beyond cray cray
asoiaf,not_removed,dany is wrong plenty of targaryens died of sickness the targaryen dynasty was almost wiped out by the great summer sickness daeron ii valarr and matarys egg was spared because he was in dorne aemon was spared because he was in oldtown the hightowers locked down the city whatever dany is thinking it is not true
asoiaf,not_removed,doesnt change the fact that she cant remember herself being sick
asoiaf,not_removed,she also believes herself to be immune to fire but grrm dismisses her surviving walking in to drogos pyre as a oneoff freak accident
asoiaf,not_removed,that might be more ab out dany personally though also didnt egg get the throne because some of his relatives died of sickness
asoiaf,not_removed,she is sick and at the end of adwd
asoiaf,not_removed,good point
asoiaf,not_removed,not sure but i remember that aenys i st was illborn and more or less died of illness
asoiaf,not_removed,people have been worried about this for a long time as someone whos been a fan since allow me to advise you to find other ways to fill your time
asoiaf,not_removed,technically there were two no update updates in the last month and a growing but not done update back in may if you really want to get carried away the may update notes that whilst his profile picture still has the monkey on his back then there is still no twow his current profile picture has no monkey i suspect this is more of an oversight than a subtle admission of completion my guess which is no more than that is easter next year for completion summer for release i have no great concerns that twow will never come out ados well lets hope the us health care system is as great as it advertises itself to be but i have to concur with other posters here let it go the book will be done when its done if ever worrying ranting checking not a blog calculating word counts none of that is going to make it happen any quicker go read something else or better yet write something just if you do make sure you finish the fucker
asoiaf,not_removed,im almost certain that twow will come out about sure that it will be done before the show ends in two years time but i dont think it will be finished im not even sure he will be able to finish it in two more books
asoiaf,not_removed,i was convinced that it would be out in late my hope trained crashed and burned in sometimes i look back on the westeros website and realize i have post that are years old talking about twow and its potential published date i really was a summer child i told myself the essos knot is untied he is past the time skip problem he should sail threw twow its all down hill from here plot points are closing it not long now he already has a good chunk of twow written and now we are months into and not a single peep im honestly losing more and more interest in this series as each month goes by i was especially disappointed when i read that he pretty much took a year break after dance to work on other projects and the constant trips the vacations and such would not be so bad but he refuses to work on a laptop in his down time on said vacations at this point my hope train isnt even smoldering i would be surprised if we got twow in im not expecting to get my hands on dance for at least years i think the best thing is just to step back and try to push it all out of my mind until i see the internet blow up when if twow is announced
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps twow is done but he is writing ados and itll be out before season okay i need to stop dreaming
asoiaf,not_removed,i think well get an announcement of some sort soon he hasnt posted on his not a blog in quite some time i know he was busy with cons the last few weeks but this is still not like him to be quiet for so long most likely im wrong and he has about words of posts about this years hugo awards ready to go but i am hopeful the book will still come out this year or perhaps early next year
asoiaf,not_removed,nope
asoiaf,not_removed,why do people feel the need to post this same thing practically every other day
asoiaf,not_removed,he shold give up on it explore a new culture a new era the show can finish asoiaf without him
asoiaf,not_removed,all hail book and i think grrm will name it a time for the mannis dreamingnaypraying that stannis will make it till the end of ados
asoiaf,not_removed,he was writing winds during feast and dance technically
asoiaf,not_removed,what
asoiaf,not_removed,except the show basically has an entirely different plot right now so its ending will be its own thing
asoiaf,not_removed,hes got the two awesome schmucks who wrote the world of ice and fire they can do it right
asoiaf,not_removed,i think hell be give us more great stuff to read if he can break out of the asoiaf peripd and place
asoiaf,not_removed,hes not going to finish he should move on
asoiaf,not_removed,the period is a bazillion millennia and there are hundreds if not thousands of places in woiaf you must be hoping for something in outer space or a galaxy far far away
asoiaf,not_removed,yes sorry if that wasnt clear explore awoiaf let the show finish off asoiaf i just cant see him finishing asoiaf hes stuck but he could bring so much joy to us exploring other lands cultures and times
asoiaf,not_removed,im greedy i want him to finish and give us more about all those mysterious places in world
asoiaf,not_removed,if grand northern conspiracy plays out then the dreadfort is the only seat that will need to be replaced
asoiaf,not_removed,i think davos will bring back rickon so he would be the heir apparent of winterfell hornwood needs a lord as would the dreadfort horpe and massey make the most sense if stannis chooses southerners he could also reward a mountain clan or maybe a glover
asoiaf,not_removed,somehow stark will regain the north i just know it
asoiaf,not_removed,smaller houses have been wiped out or almost wiped out theres still no lord of hornwood
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis would need to be very politically inept if he were to try and grant any northern land to southerners especially a lordship as important as the dreadfort
asoiaf,not_removed,im still holding out for lawrence snow bastard of the last hornwood to be legitimized and granted hornwood
asoiaf,not_removed,thats why i brought the question up because its obvious he has to grant some titles to his leal soldiers for losing lands and such for siding with him but it would be a political disaster to grant a northern seat to a southerner
asoiaf,not_removed,king jon stark targaryean king in the north killer of others legitimizer of bastards
asoiaf,not_removed,except he doesnt need to grant lands or titles to his leal soldiers he is not king in the north he is king of the kingdoms which includes the stormlands and crownlands where his soldiers come from the north is not his end game simply a stopping point from which to gather more strength to fight for his claim
asoiaf,not_removed,someone called
asoiaf,not_removed,yea but he believes he is the rightful king of the seven kingdoms all of the seven kingdoms
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly so he has no need to grant lands to his soldiers who already have lands where they are from the fact that they were confiscated by the illegitimate baratheon iron throne means nothing stannis will simply get them their own lands back he would need to install a warden of the north my guess would be either glover or manderly then let him figure out the minor houses
asoiaf,not_removed,he died long ago though
asoiaf,not_removed,in his notes to his editor they are different characters the show combined them to make the story easier to follow for a television audience
asoiaf,not_removed,nope grrm has said unequivocally that he is not
asoiaf,not_removed,i totally agree with you benjen is coldhands in the book even if there is a handwritten note that says otherwise
asoiaf,not_removed,dont worry when the book comes out and reveals benjen is coldhands everyone is gonna be triggered and butt hurt but youll be right
asoiaf,not_removed,how about we not say it is debunked until we finally read the book i wouldnt take a hand written note as canon why else would coldhands hide his identity from bran in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,uh a single hand written no is not unequivocally
asoiaf,not_removed,uh because he isnt benjen bran doesnt trust coldhands on their way north even going so far as to question him about his appearance if coldhands was benjen and wanted bran to relax he could have said hey kid im your uncle and im here to look out for you instead he just calls himself brans monster also he child of the forest says he was killed long ago i doubt that meant three years ago why would grrm lie to his editor in a conversation that was private
asoiaf,not_removed,well you cant say but grrm has debunked it several times since he was confused when his editor suggested it hes likely not hiding his identity as much as hiding his appearance he is a self described monster whose appearance would assuredly frighten a couple teenagers north of the wall his identity is more than likely irrelevant to meera and bran as the he died long ago line spoken by a cotf implies he was dead long before meera and bran were born
asoiaf,not_removed,actually he called bloodraven brans monster not himself
asoiaf,not_removed,a monster bran said the ranger looked at bran as if the rest of them did not exist your monster brandon stark bran i adwd
asoiaf,not_removed,i can see that
asoiaf,not_removed,meeras gloved hand tightened around the shaft of her frog spear who sent you who is this threeeyed crow a friend dreamer wizard call him what you will the last greenseer the longhalls wooden door banged open outside the night wind howled bleak and black the trees were full of ravens screaming coldhands did not move a monster bran said the ranger looked at bran as if the rest of them did not exist your monster brandon stark
asoiaf,not_removed,we go with the ranger said jojen we have come too far to turn back now meera we would never make it back to the wall alive we go with brans monster or we die but youre probably still right
asoiaf,not_removed,i think some of these pairings will go their seperate ways i see jon heading south and melissandre staying at the wall i also think brienne and jamie will split each following trail of a different stark daughter
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its possible that ifwhen jon comes back we may not get his pov i think itd be cool if we didnt have it for twow and then got it back for ados
asoiaf,not_removed,aeron a deadman before the book is over i agree but heres a link that implies but doesnt set in stone that there will be at least one more aeron pov aside from the forsaken
asoiaf,not_removed,aeron is pretty much confirmed dead i would think likely to do with being a sacrifice to either the drowned god or rhollor he was strapped there for a reason brienne jamie are hard to tell its very grrmesque for any of them to die and i cant predict who dies and who doesnt
asoiaf,not_removed,jon snow because hes dead
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont believe theons i plot is done hasnt felt like that for me once pretty sure hell be doing a lot
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think any of them are heading to bravos especially when arya dont look long for that place either
asoiaf,not_removed,who do you think jaime will go after i always assumed hed survive the encounter with lsh and then head to kl to deal with cersei i can see brienne going to the vale if she survived though
asoiaf,not_removed,going the wrong direction is kind of briennes thing so i guess shell end up in the hbw
asoiaf,not_removed,well when robb sends terms to the crown remittance of taxes and incomes were part of the deal seems reasonable that all lords have the same duties to the crown
asoiaf,not_removed,it wouldnt have been tribute the other regions were no longer kingdoms they paid taxes and were required to muster troops when needed
asoiaf,not_removed,taxes
asoiaf,not_removed,also when dorne was annexed into the realm one of the conditions was the ability for the prince of dorne to levy his own taxes instead of the crown and i think lowered taxes paid to the crown this was a big contributing factor to the dornish hate jay fueled the blackfyre rebellion so its safe to assume all lords pay taxes
asoiaf,not_removed,do they ever discuss amounts or s
asoiaf,not_removed,inches of the lords cock so everyone always wanted to pay over so people would never question the length of their lieges cock edit im used to think in the metric system damn you english measuring system
asoiaf,not_removed,no because despite martins famous bitching about tolkien not detailing tax rates in what is essentially heroic germanic epic grrm fails to do any better in a series of gritty political realism
asoiaf,not_removed,the vale is in luck then
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm mentions tax systems all the time not mentioning s is hardly failing to do any better that kind of detail would be tedious imo the odd coin or penny tax mentioned is enough
asoiaf,not_removed,just wait for theon to take over the iron islands
asoiaf,not_removed,no he really really doesnt what is the basis of the norths economy we can presume its timber and wool but this is not confirmed how are these transported what tax is levied on them what of merchants vs lords rights over the trade what tariffs and dockage fees must a trader pay at white harbour we know nothing about taxes in westeros beyond the fact that they evidently exist and this is supposed to be the gritty historical political series
asoiaf,not_removed,ill wait for it to be explicitly stated in the books otherwise ill keep assuming he has his dick
asoiaf,not_removed,no he really really doesnt he mentions levies numbers times littlefingers command of the tax system got him to his position in kings landing the dwarfs penny he includes the fact that his world operates on trade and taxes and politics to differentiate it fantasy books with endless dungeons of gold he includes the family trees to create a depth of history but he fudges them so that they arent overly complicated in terms of the story what is the basis of the norths economy we can presume its timber and wool but this is not confirmed how are these transported what tax is levied on them what of merchants vs lords rights over the trade what tariffs and dockage fees must a trader pay at white harbour we know nothing about taxes in westeros beyond the fact that they evidently exist and this is supposed to be the gritty historical political series lmfao you want him to detail every single tarrif fee and levy in a country the size of europe dont be absurd it would be completely pointless drivel it would add way more pages to the series and achieve nothing if you want to know specifics of medieval tax systems read a history book
asoiaf,not_removed,he mentions levies numbers times yes military levies you know thats nothing to do with taxes right littlefingers command of the tax system got him to his position in kings landing yes which is merely asserted and never shown exactly like what grrm whinges about with aragorn the dwarfs penny you mean that thing that is completely unenforceable and whose inclusion shows martin doesnt have a clue how governments or treasuries actually function he includes the fact that his world operates on trade and taxes and politics no he doesnt he just says it does and shows nothing of trade or taxes lmfao you want him to detail every single tarrif fee and levy in a country the size of europe no i really really dont that would be shockingly terrible even worse than adwd it would have no place thematically or in terms of character or plot its inclusion would detract massively from the narrative what i want is for him not to criticise others for not including extraneous tedium but them choose correctly to leave it out himself thats the height of stupidity and hypocrisy dont bitch about someone not including tax rate details in an homage to germanic sagas if you cant be arsed including the same in your gritty realistic world if you want to know specifics of medieval tax systems read a history book i do which is rather more than old grrm can claim
asoiaf,not_removed,yes military levies you know thats nothing to do with taxes right and also in a fiscal sense littlefingers wine factors levied taxes on wine for example yes which is merely asserted and never shown exactly like what grrm whinges about with aragorn when did tolkien ever even assert or briefly touch on taxes if he didnt its hardly exactly the same acok details what some of the ways in lfs treasury functioned you mean that thing that is completely unenforceable and whose inclusion shows martin doesnt have a clue how governments or treasuries actually function how is it unenforceable you realise plenty of countries tax prostitution today can they fudge the numbers to reduce taxible income sure but so can many people who trade in cash no he doesnt he just says it does and shows nothing of trade or taxes mentioning it covers the fact thats its included i honest dont think much more detail would add anything no i really really dont that would be shockingly terrible even worse than adwd it would have no place thematically or in terms of character or plot its inclusion would detract massively from the narrative what i want is for him not to criticise others for not including extraneous tedium but them choose correctly to leave it out himself thats the height of stupidity and hypocrisy so you dont want any more detail yet you are complaining about his level of detail a bit spurious to be honest dont bitch about someone not including tax rate details in an homage to if you cant be arsed including the same in your gritty realistic world i dont think he was complaining about the specific tax rate not being included if he was that was dumb but rather pointing out in a rhetoric manner the fact that middleearth just exists without having to function it just works for the sake of fantasy when the is gone everything is rosy he wanted wanted westeros to have to function a bit more like medieval europe where everything is much more grey than black and white taxes standing armies famine raiders internal power struggles military warfare etc
asoiaf,not_removed,so you dont want any more detail yet you are complaining about his level of detail a bit spurious to be honest can you read at the very least what he wrote instead of replying to this fictional person you are speaking to he´s criticizing the fact that grrm complained about the vagueness of tolkien´s world´s economy while he himself doesnt explain anything it has nothing to do with what the other person wants it´s all about what grrm complained and not done himself
asoiaf,not_removed,hes given a whole list of tax whenever and suggested grrm should have told us there is that better im disagreeing he should have given the to us allowing for what he said where did grrm complain that jrrt didnt give detailed specific tax rates for every fiscal aspect of middle earth if you thought thats what grrm was complaining about and suggesting that he was going to do then you misunderstood him imo anyway my last post on the topic its irrelevant really
asoiaf,not_removed,where did grrm complain that jrrt didnt give detailed specific tax rates for every fiscal aspect of middle earth httpgameofthroneswikiacomwikicurrencythemes if you thought thats what grrm was complaining about and suggesting that he was going to do then you misunderstood him imo anyway my last post on the topic its irrelevant really sigh i hate when people can admit being wrong fact is grrm complained about something he hasn´t fixed himself or barely did by mentioning random numbers sometimes and a couple taxes
asoiaf,not_removed,alternately why does lightbringer have to be a sword it could be a person and the whole story is a metaphor for his or her birth the first two attempts represent older siblings and nissa nissa giving her soul could be her dying in child birth
asoiaf,not_removed,so aa would be lightbringerbringer
asoiaf,not_removed,my theory has been as such for a while now john breaks longclaw in an epic battle against an other after falling in love with dany he tries desperately to reforge longclaw and fails untill during his third reforging he plunges it through danys heart and it re emerges as lightbringer pulled from fire dany being the fire
asoiaf,not_removed,well the sword still mustliterally or metaphoricallybe tempered in water a lion and nissa nissa in that order until jon does those things with longclaw i dont think we can say hes wielding lightbringer
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion is lightbringer
asoiaf,not_removed,interesting theory never heard of that before but yeah jon choose donal noyes old quarters as his so
asoiaf,not_removed,i just dont see it being this literal it will be more metaphorical imo
asoiaf,not_removed,why do you think it has to be tempered in water and a lion the swords tempered in water and a lion broke so how can it be possible for light bringer to be tempered in water and a lion it needs to be tempered in a loved one and the sword is most likely a metaphor
asoiaf,not_removed,that was how it was made originally but why would the sword need to be made again instead of found the prophecy states that lightbringer will be drawn from a fire so do you really think that first a sword must be tempered in water then in a lion and then in someone close to the presumed aa and then plunged into fire again its very convoluted
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i agree i wanted to say that we dont have to look at every sword in the westeros and theorize if it is ten thousand years old lightbringer looking at you dawn if jon or whoever is aa can just make another one
asoiaf,not_removed,dany and jon both fit too
asoiaf,not_removed,gasp i hadnt ever thought about the lion part has anyone hypothesized that it is tyrion or another lannister
asoiaf,not_removed,i said or metaphorically but something needs to be tempered in water and a lion before lightbringer is forged im not saying they havent happened yet just that if longclaw does become lightbringer like op is theorizing then jon wouldve had toagain literally or metaphoricallytemper a sword in water then in a lion lets think what events in jons life could be superimposed onto those metaphors its an interesting thought
asoiaf,not_removed,i know right its crazy im just trying to operate within the rules of the original post and clearly its impossible
asoiaf,not_removed,yes
asoiaf,not_removed,we wouldnt have to temper anything in water or or a lion seeing as how those werent lightbringer the recipe for lightbringer is not tempering different swords in water or lion the recipe for lightbringer is sacrifice
asoiaf,not_removed,all this talk of lb needing to be forged in water and a lion brings to mind syrio and his talk of men being made of water
asoiaf,not_removed,well there was this sword joffrey dropped into the river
asoiaf,not_removed,literally or metaphoricallytemper a sword in water then in a lion he doesnt have to temper it in a lion or water those are broken blades one has nothing to do with the other he could just skip straight to nissa nissa dany and get the same result in other words the original lb was not tempered in water and a lion those are two entirely different and failed blades the blade that became lb was only tempered in nissas heart
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess ive always taken the whole myth into account when thinking about how to make the sword i feel like every lightbringer theory ive seen takes the whole myth into account but maybe not
asoiaf,not_removed,well men are water and lannisters are men and lannisters are lions and jon can fall in love with a lannister kill them with the sword and ez pz lightbringer
asoiaf,not_removed,huh and the second one he had had a lion with a heart in its mouth on it
asoiaf,not_removed,i think you are right in that every theory i have seen seems to need to try to recreate in someway the version we heard original aa legend i think though it is worth noting that we have yet to actually see what the prophecy actually says so we dont know what if any conditions are actually important i am of the opinion that if something fits we will really only get there with hindsight as the prophecy is so general in my opinion so that we can debate the dozen or so people we think we can make it fit too side not fun game is to try and apply the aa thing to random characters that we know it is not about
asoiaf,not_removed,jon snow falls in love with tyrion confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,and the third was used to brutally murder a book so obviously this means joffrey loved books he was just so ashamed of this love he pretended not to tragic
asoiaf,not_removed,he is already into satin so its good
asoiaf,not_removed,if stannis had been given storms end as his seat hed have spent the next decade bitching to anyone that listened that robert didnt grant him dragonstone which is his by rights as heir to the iron throne though he may have stopped when joffrey was born
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis would still have been sent to capture dragonstone as he was roberts eldest brother and bobby b couldnt do it himself but he would be given storms end while renly got dragonstone it is therefore likely he would still be master of ships and renly master of laws stannis would have received a better match than selyse florent as he wouldve been one of the great lords renly wouldnt get the tyrell marriage because the relationship between him and loras started when loras squired at storms end also he couldnt offer much when the war of the five kings started stannis wouldnt have had edric storm because he wouldve had a better match so he couldnt prove that joffery was a bastard he also wasnt that popular hed fight and lose in a similar way renly would probably have pledged himself to joffery in exchange for storms end likely being married to a lannister girl of tywins choosing to solidify the south the tyrells would have joined the lannisters more quickly so the war against robb would be over faster likely with a ceasefire and robb remaining lord of winterfell as roose bolton suggested would happen arya would probably be reunited with her family robbs first born son would have a marriage contract with a lannister girl a few of the starks would be sent as hostages to kl
asoiaf,not_removed,it would have never been given to renly what he would have done instead who knows but its likely he would have never gained the support of the tyrells this would benefit stannis in the long run later he probably wouldnt have had the influence of mel however i dont think it was her doing that resulted in him pushing his claim he would have still tried to push his claim however with the entire stormlands behind him from the get go so he would have ended up attacking kings landing and without the tyrells and lannisters allying he would have succeeded even if renly did somehow end up marrying margaery and naming himself king he wouldnt have had the stormlands as well in this scenario stannis wouldnt have ended up killing him because he wouldnt have mel and so i guess theyd either be at each other throats on a much larger scale ie reach vs stormlands war or they would have found common ground either way renly likely doesnt die so easily and so margaery never marries joffrey and the lannisters are left alone fighting robb and stannis much of stannis disdain with renly was because he felt that he didnt deserve the stormlands and that its bannermen had been stolen from him so he would have perhaps been more forgiving of renly crowning himself king im sure somebody else could expand on this
asoiaf,not_removed,mel seems to believe it is more based on where he was born born amidst salt and smoke so no matter what he was given he was still born at storms end but she refers to dragonstone he is not dead stannis is the lords chosen destined to lead the fight against the dark i have seen it in the flames read of it in ancient prophecy when the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers azor ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt jon had heard all this before stannis baratheon was the lord of dragonstone but he was not born there he was born at storms end like his brothers he frowned and what of mance is he lost as well what do your fires show adwd jon x when jon questions her she doesnt reply instead she answers jons question about seeing only snow mel has been trying so hard to make the aa fit stannis that she has blinded herself to anything that could mean she was wrong so even if he had been given storms end im sure he would have still somehow fit into her idea about how aa is coming about i just dont think she would have picked renley especially since he doesnt seem the type to turn into a religious follower not sure how the lord of light looks at homosexual relationships either way soon she will see that she has been wrong the signs just dont add up enough for it to be stannis not saying hes not important to the battle that is to come but hes just not the main character in all this the signs more point to jon or dany and mel will see that eventually as well even grrm has said about her melisandre has gone to stannis entirely on her own and has her own agenda
asoiaf,not_removed,the mannis took storms end so in the end it doesnt matter king stannis
asoiaf,not_removed,i disagree witht he top voted replies stannis would be happy with storms end its way wealthier and larger than dragonstone he wouldnt have anything to complain aboutexcept ned being picked as hand but he definitely would not cry about dragonstone
asoiaf,not_removed,what pisses me off is that robert actually weakens is own house by putting stannis at dragonstone there are technically two house bratheons now the royal house and the lesser house baratheon lord of the stormlands by putting renly as lord of storms end he basically with out officially saying it made renly lord of the stormlands he placed stannis outside of the stormlands and gave him dragonstone neither of these things makes the baratheons any stronger what he should have done was officially decree that dragonstone was now part of the stormlands a reward to stannis for holding storms end and given the title of lord of storms end and the stormlands to stannis asking him to give renly dragonstone fealty to stannis and for stannis to pay close attention to dragonstone as it is a targaryen loyalist hotspot that makes both houses stronger robert has a better relationship with his heir till joffery is born and a better relationship with the lord of the stormmlands meanwhile the stormlands grow stronger and are better run
asoiaf,not_removed,the issue with this question is that dragonstone had to go to someone and stannis really was the best person for the task i truly believe that once his heir became of age to wed robert would have given the island to him as the targaryens did and he would have sent stannis back to storms end as the rightful lord but assuming that they found someone else to have storms end maybe a castellan to hold it until his firstborn sun becomes of age i think stannis would still be master of ships and be on the small council with jon arryn i think renly would eventually make it there too in some capacity they still find out about the incest only now since renly has no major holdings he would be more inclined to back his brother after roberts death which means that when renly approaches ned he wouldnt ask ned to choose the younger brother and ned might have taken his men own men with him when he confronted cersei there would have been a smoothish transition cersei and jaime would likely be charged with treason stannis would still set up a renlymargery wedding this would give mace an outside shot of having his daughter be queen since stanniss only heir is shireen and they might skip her over in the succession as was precedence especially if the lannisters try to fight the crown and stannis is killed either way having your daughter marry the new lord of the stormlands sets up a strong southern alliance or they could set up a loras shireen wedding in the future it really hurts with both renly and loras being gay if they were straight this would be so much easier to set up either way we have a much more boing story but a probably alive eddard stark and an extremely salty littlefinger
asoiaf,not_removed,he would have been a staunch supporter of joffrey in the war because by law until he finds out that joffrey is a bastard and will raise his banners against joffrey in the books and show stannis retreated to dragonstone because he was afraid that of an assasination but in this scenerio he will not retreat and hide but instead raise his banners and declare joffrey a bastard however he would not be very successful in gainly lords to his side but more successful than in the books due to the influence of storms end
asoiaf,not_removed,mel wouldnt support stannis she went to dragonstone believing azor ahai was there she would only find renly without mel telling stannis he will be king he may not bother raising his army once robert dies
asoiaf,not_removed,well if he was given storms end then maybe melisandre wouldve thought someone else was azor ahai she had a vision of dragonstone so she assumed who ever ruled there was azor ahai
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis may have been in a position to bring dorne to his side assuming the war of the five kings still happens being at their doorstep
asoiaf,not_removed,realistically if robert really wanted to end the association of dragonstone crown prince then he should have given it to renly if anyone and let stannis be the rightful lord of storms end as it was he appeared to be adhering to targaryen tradition and annointing his elder younger brother as heir to the iron throne and crown prince until such time as he had his own heirs but as others have noted im quite sure stannis would have found a way to bitch about that anyway and loras tyrell probably would have still managed to turn renlys head with ideas of being king as the tyrells could have sent him to squire for renly at dragonstone as much as they did at storms end the major difference is that renly would not have been able to call upon the stormland nobles when he made his pitch for the iron throne he would have been limited to those nobles surrounding dragonstone and his friends in the reach now the latter would still give him a sizeable army but he wouldnt have the legitimacy of the baratheons home turf as for melisandre i really dont know we dont actually know that she just went to dragonstone saw stannis and thought that must be azor ahai reborn did she have a vision of stannis specifically was she sent by rhllorwhoever to stannis in particular because he has some role in the war against the others or would she have rocked up to dragonstone found renly and thought aha that must be azor ahai reborn ¯ツ¯
asoiaf,not_removed,now i am trying to imagine mel proclaiming renly as azor ahai it is amusing me to no end
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis would be in an even worse positon than he is now as there would be another master of ships in charge of the royal fleet stannis had the easier task of turning the narrow sea island lords against robert as they would have lost the influence they had under the targaryens renly was loved the stormlords that did rebel and not all did did so because of his popularity stannis would have gained less support than his younger brother from the stormlands and pretty much no reach support renly still has his claim presumably still has the same personality so may well still have the support of the reach lords should he rebel and it is less clear if the reach lords would do so now that stannis dorne and the westerlands are all potential threats hed still have a strong chance of victory
asoiaf,not_removed,well it would stabilise the relationship of robert with him i guess but nothing more than that stannis does his duty regardless of love
asoiaf,not_removed,ding ding we have a winner stannis with a grievance was like a mastiff with a bone
asoiaf,not_removed,correct you are stannis suffers from a severe victim complex and spends far too much much time bitching about every everything robert while reading adwd i shook my head as i read this that requires stealing a leaf from my brothers book not that robert ever read one i must deal my foes a mortal blow before they know that i am on them robert has been dead for years and was acknowledged as one of the greatest generals warriors and tacticians of westeros and stannis still had to throw in the little snide remark he never lets anything go even beyond the grave this guy could not rule
asoiaf,not_removed,im the one who took the island and castle why did he grant it to renly
asoiaf,not_removed,hes such a typical middle child
asoiaf,not_removed,ah i forgot about edric without a florent to get knocked up by bobby b he wouldnt be the proof stannis needed there is the matter though that he and jon arryn knew about gendry but i guess gendry wasnt claimed like edric was so kinda renders that moot though its robert so who is to say he wouldnt have knocked some other highborn lady during stanisss wedding
asoiaf,not_removed,i disagree about getting a better match than selyse florent they were buttugly yes but the florents were an old house and most of the reach considered them better born than the tyrells it could be argued that intermarrying between kingdoms is relatively new but even so the florents had married into house gardener and traced their ancestors to garth greenhand so there arent many higher born families
asoiaf,not_removed,this is probably the most accurate awnser
asoiaf,not_removed,arent the florents one of the major houses of the reach like second tier
asoiaf,not_removed,but would renly even make his own claim in this scenario renly made his claim originally when he had the backing of the reach and the stormlands if all he has is dragonstone i dont know if he would really still declare war in this scenario he might back joffreys claim instead though in which case lannisters would win the war of kings pretty easily
asoiaf,not_removed,if all things were somehow equal he very easily takes kings landing there were at least things that conspired to make it happen storm winds when trying to return from storms end after coming down from dragonstone slowed him down to the point where the boom chain was ready just in time and the wildfire was repurposed from cerseis hands to tyrions who set up the wildfire trap in the first place only barely in time to organize against stannis who still would have taken the city if not for tywin showing up at the last minute along with the reach causing stanniss host to turn all of these things happened last minute and none of them would have happened on time if stannis just had to go up from storms end instead of having to go from dragonstone down to storms end and back now does he hold it afterwards maybe maybe not but with tywin having nobody to marry to the tyrells them teaming up is questionable
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis was already lord of dragonstone when melisandre came to him i think it more likely that she sought out the lord of dragonstone based on the prophesies met stannis and then began to disregard everything she couldnt shoehorn him into
asoiaf,not_removed,when jon questions her she doesnt reply instead she answers jons question about seeing only snow one easy answer is that she simply interpreted born as realized his destiny as aa
asoiaf,not_removed,meanwhile the stormlands grow stronger and are better run this part is very debatable what makes you think that stannis would be better at administration than renly stannis is unyielding generally unwilling to back down on anything thinskinned and holds grudges he also has a general contempt for daytoday courtly politics and those who play it none of these things make for a good administrator meanwhile renly is adaptable clever popular and pragmatic with a very good grasp of politics and a willingness to play it as necessary as i mentioned elsewhere he would have easily won the war of five kings if stannis hadnt assassinated him and while he had a good position a lot of that was also his tactical and political capabilities as well as his overwhelming popularity heres the example i used before to show why renly would make a better king suppose the war of five kings was over early and the new king was faced with robb still in rebellion in the north how would they react renly would recognize that with his fathers killers dead and deposed robb no longer has any particular reason to continue fighting and is probably looking for a graceful exit strategy after being crowned king in the north so once he was safely on the throne and in a position to do so without losing support hed make some sort of token concessions and reunite the realm without further fighting stannis would have said fuck you you give me whats mine and started another pointless and unnecessary war
asoiaf,not_removed,yes that would arguably make that house stronger but when has robert shown that level of intelligence great on the battlefield not so much in the political field
asoiaf,not_removed,renly was the lord of the stormlands he was never under stannis at any point moreover if you want what is strongest for roberts house it is him keeping all of the lands for himself then splitting them up among his own sons rather than his brothers
asoiaf,not_removed,renly didnt ask eddard to support his claim heres what he actually suggested strike now while the castle sleeps renly looked back at ser boros again and dropped his voice to an urgent whisper we must get joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand protector or no the man who holds the king holds the kingdom we should seize myrcella and tommen as well once we have her children cersei will not dare oppose us the council will confirm you as lord protector and make joffrey your ward
asoiaf,not_removed,i think he would have been more successful he can certainly hide in storms end that place doesnt fall too easily as the baratheon seat and defacto ruler of the stormlands i think they wouldve followed him and supported him strongly i guess the question is what does renly do
asoiaf,not_removed,what war would stannis be supporting joffrey in if he was lord of storms end that he wouldnt as lord of dragonstone
asoiaf,not_removed,potentially joff if we assume robert sees him as his heir traditionally that is the seat of the heir to the iron throne i dont see renly being given dragonstone now joffrey as aa would be pretty funny
asoiaf,not_removed,well until dorne got to know stanniss personality oberyn tell us some about your plans for your rule stannis i plan to outlaw all whores as sex makes me uncomfortable and i also hate drinking and almost all types of fun oberyn you know what we are pretty cool with sticking with the lannisters at this point stannis grinding ones teeth is the only type of fun i think one needs to really enjoy life however more truthfully they still would have just sat around waiting for the targaryens to come
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think there is a reason to believe stannis wouldnt still be master of ships i mean storms end is right on a bay even if it is shipbreaker bay
asoiaf,not_removed,unless that duty is informing his king or hand of incestuous adultery
asoiaf,not_removed,to be fair snide remarks are his right by relation imo p
asoiaf,not_removed,actually given the timeline of the novels during adwd robert would only have been dead for a year and a half at most
asoiaf,not_removed,a victim complex as well as a middle child issue watching his parents die probably didnt help either
asoiaf,not_removed,true enough i adore stannis but he has a very severe victimization of himself
asoiaf,not_removed,robert has been dead for years and was acknowledged as one of the greatest generals warriors and tacticians of westeros and stannis still had to throw in the little snide remark he never lets anything go even beyond the grave this guy could not rule hes also not the reading type he was making a joke based off relating the expressing to robert and holding grudges doesnt mean stannis will act on them he has enough selfcontrol to not act out
asoiaf,not_removed,hed come up with some way to complain about that too i held storms end and took dragonstone by rights i should hold both hes never be satisfied with anything robert gave him because theyre both douchey people stannis is pissy and irritable and robert does things like fuck a prettier girl in stans wedding bed so there was never going to be happy contentment with stannis in roberts court thered always be something why am i only master of ships and not master of laws or hand and so on
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess the point was there were other matches with wealthier holdings and such hightowers and rowans come to mind
asoiaf,not_removed,he might have managed a better match even within house florent given that selyse was only the daughter of lord florents second oldest brother if hed married one of lord florents own daughters it could have changed everything just by changing the date and seating arrangements as lord of the stormlands he would have had marriage offers from everyone
asoiaf,not_removed,i think any of the great families could be considered of higher birth which is what renly got with storms end
asoiaf,not_removed,thank you
asoiaf,not_removed,they are but selyse is the daughter of lord florents oldest brother even within house florent there may have been better matches as lord of the stormlands stannis would have had offers from every high lord in westeros he probably would have had offers from the rowans and the hightowers who would be far more likely to betrothe a daughter to the lord of storms end than to the lord of dragonstone which was relatively poor and lacked manpower
asoiaf,not_removed,amen other than making jon arryn his hand i cant think of one thing that robert did that was actaully a smart well thought out idea that would improve the kingdom and even the jon arryn pick was only ok and the most obvious one
asoiaf,not_removed,robert was pretty careless he just didnt consider the long term consequences he probably thought sure lets make jon the hand hes a great guy and stannis needs a reward dragonstone will do nicely and finally i guess that make renly the lord of storms end whats the worse that could happen
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont really see how robert was dumb he just didnt seem to care but i cant think of anything that was obviously stupid unless i am forgetting something
asoiaf,not_removed,never said renly was under stannis i said he should have been robert had the crownlands renly had the stormlands he was already not giving that to his sons regardless unless he was planning on stripping it from renly
asoiaf,not_removed,does it happen in the show or am i completely misremembering the whole thing im only asking because i thought it happened and i only read agot the once
asoiaf,not_removed,it dont see why he wouldnt be master of ships either history has shown the office is sometimes held by lords who dont even border the sea like mace tyrell during asos the lord paramount of the stormlands could easily be master of ships besides stannis was made master of ships in all but name even before he received dragonstone robert asked him to build and command a royal fleet to take it from the targaryens and it also placed one of the council seats in the hands of a baratheon loyalist and proven commanderadmiral
asoiaf,not_removed,to the dead it shows pettiness stannis keeps saying ned was no friend to him after a while i want to say give it a rest with this no body loves me and i am bitter crap
asoiaf,not_removed,it rarely does
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis always does that i was so saddened by his description of proudwing his goshawk he was upset that it was not a soaring bird of prey and robert mocked him i looked it up it appears stannis knows nothing about falconry the bird was acting precisely as it should it was an ambush predator not a soaring hunter httpsenwikipediaorgwikibrowngoshawk stannis was just born to sulk i guess
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe he could have married delena florent or gotten a better marriage altogether if he was to bring in ties to the reach then the next best choice would be lynesse hightower
asoiaf,not_removed,actually i think stannis did the best he could within the florents alesters first daughter is melessa sams mom and shes been married to randyll tarly since at the very least ac stannis got married a few years after roberts rebellion which was ac so by the time hes looking to get married lord florents eldest daughter was probably already betrothed maybe even married depending on how long the tarlys took to conceive sam alester has a younger daughter rhea who is married to leyton hightower and we know the dude hasnt been seen for at least a decade so from around ac but i would argue theyd have to be wed for a while before that because stannis would have been a much better suitor for a second daughter than an old man who already has ten heirs from another womans womb anyway probably alesters girls were already married and selyse was the next best thing the florents had laying around
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah im feeling like i subscribe to that thought too i read that post the other week about what a terrible hand he is and it makes really good sense
asoiaf,not_removed,yes several characters describe roberts careless generosity he just never thought things through or worried about the consequences he left ned to tell his girlfriends that he wouldnt be back he let jon arryn run his kingdom for him he made both his brothers lords paramount effectively he never stopped to think about whether his generosity had an edge to it would jon be able to be hand without help would ned resent dealing with the girls that robert was fucking while betrothed to his sister would his brothers end up fighting over who deserved the family title
asoiaf,not_removed,if you are arguing robert do what is strongest for his house keeping it for his sons is the answer increasing stanniss power by making him lord of storms end and placing ds under se doesnt benefit robert and his house thus his decision didnt weaken his house it might have lessened stanniss power but it didnt impact roberts power moreover if anything that goes against roberts wish for his brothers to be seperate lords not under anyone besides him robert didnt have a bad relationship with renly nor is there any reason stannis would be able to rule them better than renly in fact stanniss hardass nature would likely be more of an annoyance to roberts allies than robert would approve of
asoiaf,not_removed,it happens that way on the show
asoiaf,not_removed,but he wouldnt be stan the man baratheon if he did
asoiaf,not_removed,great catch
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know if i would call jon arryn a bad hand he was just ok it doesnt help that you have such a bad king that probably blocked him at every chance that he tried to do anything that was outside of either roberts drinking and whoring or the lannisters best interests add to that varys and littlefingers behind the scenes puppet mastering jon was completely surrounded by snakes with a king that did not give a shit
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly the only think that stopped his reign from being a total disaster was jon arryn
asoiaf,not_removed,okay thanks i thought i was losing my mind lol
asoiaf,not_removed,i am claiming stannis is petty are you agreeing
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks it was sad on several levels stannis never acknowledged when people honored him it is an odd balance to separate flattery from complement stannis never understood the difference stannis only respects those that oppose him openly and those he wants things from this make jon an interesting case jon does both
asoiaf,not_removed,i think hes saying that his fans love him for his pettiness people like him as a character not so much as a person or as someone they seriously think would be a good king
asoiaf,not_removed,i am saying he is petty and thats why we all love him
asoiaf,not_removed,this dann person in the comments can the mountain take down a dragon what is interesting hafthor was interviewed last friday by polish site westerospl in katowice poland and he said and i quote i would like to die fighting two dragons one i would kill the other would kill me tragic news for cleganebowl fans
asoiaf,not_removed,fitting the first confirmed filming date from casting calls is sept
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe but why does he need to be fitted does his kingsguard outfit need to be resized or cersei going to change the standard and make a new queensguard who knows what i do hope is fitting for a new costume is ser jorah the poor man deserved something besides his ragged eternal yellow shirt

asoiaf,not_removed,hahaha i didnt mean the prodigy one though that seems to work even better i was talking about the song by seether
asoiaf,not_removed,how about whole lotta cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,a storm of swords one hell of a book
asoiaf,not_removed,dance was easily the best written young griff reveal theon in winterfell is george at his absolute best ashas loss at deepwood and stannis march to winterfell davos on the sisters and meeting manderly conningtons landing cerseis walk
asoiaf,not_removed,great question in my opinion asos is the most interesting critically so many twists and turns and even though i had watched the first seasons of the show first i still found the narrative structure of storm very surprising however i think the best written book was affc even though it is a much slower pace than most of the rest of the series it does a great job of immersing the reader into each povs world i think martin does a masterful job of giving us several different viewpoints from which to observe this fictional world that is all about the human heart in conflict with itself this is something everyone can relate to but it may seem boring if you just want to read about a fantasy world or lots of action or drama this is the best thing about asoiaf in my opinion its not just a fantasy or just a drama or just a cool story its all of this and more and gives us a little insight as to what the human heart can cause people to do in different situations
asoiaf,not_removed,mmmperhaps agot itself i only suggest it because when you stop to think about it there are a lot of things that dont really make sense see every nitpicking post ever but the story flows so well that you dont notice the problems till potentially years later edit spelling
asoiaf,not_removed,while this may be an unpopular opinion i find a feast for crows to be the best written asos changed the game so much so many major characters died and so much happened in a short period of time so there had to be some kind of slow down i think grrm does a great job of showing what happens after so much chaos has happened how people try to take advantage of the void left by the chaos trying to grasp at power and fill the void yes it is much slower than storm but it needs to be it gives us a moment to breathe to get to learn more about these characters and the world they live in to see how different regions and people react to the devastation that the war of the five kings brought
asoiaf,not_removed,a storm of swords is probably the best self contained story with the most mainstream appeal best twists and character development agot was a great prologue and murder mystery clash had political intrigue and the threat of a looming battle but clash was the payoff the first three books are like their own trilogy and asos is a satisfying conclusion to that story as well as a jumping off point for both of the following books feast dance are great for world building and are especially good for detailhungry fans to reread and theorize over but on their own theyre incomplete and lack satisfying conclusions i dont think well be able to judge them fairly until we see how all that build up pays off
asoiaf,not_removed,agot sets the scene for the whole series fantastic writing and grabs you by the scruff of the neck in the last parts acok after reading the series for the first time this was my favorite action politics and intrigue the introduction of davos pov and one of the greatest battles of the series so far asos amazing red wedding purple wedding the mountain vs the viper a nd the battle for castle black nuff said affc enjoyed thoroughly on my first read through awaits fire and blood its an amazing political thriller set in westeros but with some fantastic characters interspersed my only dislike at first were brienne chapters no direction just time wasting until the ending now i actually really enjoy them on rereads as i see what they are really there for adwd struggled the most with this one boiled leather makes it heaps easier but simply found that dany and tyrion both bored me to tears sometimes its a shame as so many of the other povs in dance are really great jon and davos are both chapters i loved to read and getting barristan pov chapters was just superb overall my favorite book was probably acok for first time reading the series then it was asos now it may be affc or asos
asoiaf,not_removed,its hard to separate because all the books are one story asos has a lot of shit going on but that can only happen and make sense because of all that happened before id say the first one was the best for introducing the series and all its characteristics
asoiaf,not_removed,my favourite over all is asos just because that one has so many of my favourite bits of story jamiebrienne adventures oberyn martell in kings landing arya hanging with the brotherhood and subsequently with the hound the red wedding free folk attacking the wall bran and co going beyond the wall with coldhands stannis going to the north sansa going to the vale with littlefinger tyrions trial dany freeing slaves all over the bay probably some other stuff that im forgetting right now close second is affc mostly for the reasons has already laid out
asoiaf,not_removed,the first three
asoiaf,not_removed,asos is naturally generally viewed as best i wonder though until recently it was for me as well but after trying to read feast and dance together as one book per bryndenbfish suggestion i came to appreciate these two books way more than before that said i loved jaime chapters in feast with cersei chapters close by and what grrm written with theon especially in his reek chapters is harrowing you could literally feel theon terror through pages plus i am big fan of lore and i dont mind at all when writer slows down the pace to go over it and fleshes characters to new extent with asos pacing jaime could never hope to be so fleshed out plus when it comes to arguments on this and other forums regarding series characters they most source feast and dance so ill go with dance because aside of great theon chapters tyrion chapters are pretty solid davos chapters in white harbor were great i actually enjoyed jon as lord commander and the book includes her cunt became the world passage
asoiaf,not_removed,i enjoy affc
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly if i have to narrow it down for me i think agot is the most solid wellpresented of the series its a hook book getting us involved to want to read more from the prologue to the end i couldnt put it down however i think asos was probably the second best as far as pacing and overall presentation and probably number one in terms of emotional reaction as a fan who is now hooked into the series
asoiaf,not_removed,if they had come out as one book i would say the affc and adwd combined reading is the best book by a long shot as a standalone i would say asos
asoiaf,not_removed,a storm of swords the books just huge and stock piled with everything that i like about asoiaf pageturning twisting events and moments set up by all these rich characters and all executed so well and structurally its good you can even separate the book in two parts the first parts are a bit slower yet still have a fine pace and dont drag for too long and the second part is just huge i mean you get so much greatness from every page thats what i loved about it the best its got all the goods in it whereas in the other books there is a little bit of waiting time but yeah definitely the best of the a feast for crows probably a controversial opinion but i just think its the most mature of the books even though you dont get these huge events you get to read about the aftermath of the war which might seem quite boring but bear with it it can be done so badly and sometimes aftermaths can try to force to much onto you so that you easily can get pissed off but this books able to beautifully contain itself so well its almost impressive yes even after book like asos so read it with a keen eye and expand yourself and if it counts for anything i think it has the best written dialogue in the series a game of thrones this set everything off so beautifully not too little yet also not too much just about enough so that you are pleased with the singular work yet crave for more with this book alone the fantasy genre had been rewritten old tropes had been dismissed and new ones had been created its rich in its characters and its lore and it gives you just about enough information on the world of westeros its a damn great book a clash of kings its a good book dont get me wrong but something i really like about the first three that i mentioned is that i am equally interested in all the subplots whereas in this one i only craved for a couple of povs i must admit on my first read i probably skipped it all through just to read the tyrion chapters because those were fantastic and most other povs are only good or average aryas was also quite good and so was brans but i kinda oversaw the rest i wasnt too interested in those for some reason and thats why i really place the book this low a dance of dragons alright so its the same reason as i mentioned before my attention is only shifted towards a couple of the povs and the reason this book is the lowest is because its the biggest too and it really hurts that i only want to read through a couple chapters when there are hundreds upon hundreds in this book see where asos succeeds this one fails both books are huge yet at least in asos you want to read through all the chapters and you are equally invested in them all but not in this one and its even bigger this time you start getting very exhausted from reading this one because its so huge but i just made it sound like its the worst book ever wich it isnt its a great book actually but compared to the rest it falls flat yeah sorry for sounding very snobbish and pretentious in this but i just thought it was fun to write like that and you told me to write critically
asoiaf,not_removed,a storm of swords thats when the wind really fills our sails and we start moving through this story with conviction
asoiaf,not_removed,a storm of swords and a game of thrones would both be on my top five list
asoiaf,not_removed,a storm of swords for content a feast for crows for quality of writing a clear loser based on content a dance with dragons so much of it is useless plot threads that dont do anything to advance the story and danys plots are terrible
asoiaf,not_removed,a feast for crows that book while often low on rankings for best asoiaf novel has been my favorite ever since i read it there are so many brilliant chapters and thought provoking passages in it but most importantly it offers readers a chance to lull and reflect on the onslaught that was a storm of swords in order to appreciate the peaks you have to have troughs and affc is the most brilliant trough ive ever experienced
asoiaf,not_removed,a storm of swords was when the series went from wow im really enjoying this series to wow this might be the best thing ive ever read
asoiaf,not_removed,i think most would agree that asos had it all it was exciting as well as structured had a beginning middle and end unlike affcadwd and by that point we were very invested in characters so things like the red wedding and the viper vs the mountain were huge george really hit his stride with that book not to say the two after are bad but it certainly entered the second act which is slower and different in tone for sure
asoiaf,not_removed,oh my god yes i sped through the last half of that book everything about it was so exciting even chapters by characters i previously didnt care about but the jon chapters those were my favorite for sure
asoiaf,not_removed,also a personal favorite of mine jon executing janos slynt
asoiaf,not_removed,dance is polarizing because it has some of the best material in the series but thentheres meereen tyrions plot in that book really drags sometimes as well and its hard to get invested in quentyn but davos jon and theon chapters are so good that you cant put it down
asoiaf,not_removed,ya i have really come to love dance dany becoming a dragon rider is my favorite scene in the series especially given what i have since learned about its importance the bran chapters are also pretty amazing
asoiaf,not_removed,dance was easily the best written i wha how dance is easily the worst in my opinion it totally loses the plot is paced terribly and fails to make any meaningful progress
asoiaf,not_removed,dont forget of the more she drank the more she shat what of course its a great line from a brilliant author who seems that lost interest in well written books
asoiaf,not_removed,i love it because neds quest almost unfolds like a mystery novel agot kept me on my toes more than any of the other books in the series have
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed asos is the most fun to read hands down but affc is the best written without question the dialogue the mystery the hidden reveals swoon
asoiaf,not_removed,its no longer an unpopular opinion if everyone says its an unpopular opinion it becomes a popular opinion
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed if you remove the fact that youre not going to hear from a number of familiar povs and look at it as its own book its actually the best writing of the series
asoiaf,not_removed,im on my reread of a feast for crows i noticed something i noticed that this book is horrible and the series feels worse with every twist of a page the once vivid vibrant world feels dead the individual character arcs have blended together in a disgusting amalgamation of pain and misery in my mind every morning i wake up to reread a feast for crows and every night i cry myself to sleep i stopped going to work to reread a feast for crows its ok id tell myself there are many species of birds i dont even know what that means i dont understand anything i could no longer pay rent so i moved to a lowcost lowmaintenance derelic apartment downtown nobody here is educated enough to appreciate a feast for crows everyone is constantly drunk or high or both and the crime rate is only getting higher one day i saw a drunk man drinking from a filthy shoe and defecating at the side of the street the more he drank the more he shat i thought and giggled to myself he saw me and stabbed me with a rusty papercutter i think ive got tetanus now but at least ive got a feast for crows i got home bleeding and crying and i opened up my copy of a feast for crows its so disgusting now bloody and filthy and full of disease it sickens me i reached the broken man speech and the nuance of septon meribald eased my pain a bit i didnt have to cry in order to sleep today i dont think i could even if i tried though ive been eating nothing but soy beans and pasta sauce the past months my mother came to visit but all my malnutritioned eyes would allow me to see was a shady silhouette that resembled a fat pink mast she tried to talk to me i couldnt understand words are wind i thought and started laughing i scared her she left in a panic and i dont think ive seen her since i dont remember how long ago that was i lost count of the days time for me now is counted in rereads of a feast for crows david benioff only read this book times he doesnt understand i understand there are many species of birds ive grown sickly and malnurished i left all my friends a long time ago and my family barely visits anymore i can no longer stand up every day i wake up and can barely move i put my copy of a feast for crows on the coffee table next to me so that i can open the book faster every time i wake up ive lost all my will to live i want it all to end i cant move my mouth but i want to scream and cry and tear this awful book to shreds george martin is a hack game of thrones is terrible i hate essos i hate westeros i want to go home i want to die my house has fallen into disrepair every time i wake up i pray to the faceless god to end my suffering i dont remember what gods are worshipped in the real world whoever they are i hope they end my suffering i look at the ceiling and see its musty and about to collapse i pray that it falls on my head and cracks my skull in half i remembered that men have scars women mysteries but i fear that if that happens i might survive and forget all about a feast for crows i love a feast for crows i hate a feast for crows i hope the country gets invaded war seems like a fine adventure after all i hope the war kills me i want it all to end i miss the world i miss my family i even miss emilia clarke and mark mylod i hate this goddamn book i hate myself how did i let it all come to this so how are you guys enjoying your reread of a feast for crows d
asoiaf,not_removed,affc is the mrrobot season of asoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i loved feast on first read through i think a lot of people dont like it because they waited so long for affc after getting asos that they were underwhelmed but you are exactly right after major political leaders are murdered people jostle and backstab for power i love the politics of feast and the way they end up playing out through the different povs
asoiaf,not_removed,its not that unpopular from a point of appreciating narrative structures i love the experimentation in affc its especially fascinating to see cerseis paranoia grow im always happy if i get sansa and arya chapters because theyre my favorites kind of dreading not getting any sansa ones in adwd it was a very slow read for me but i didnt hate it that being said i still have to read adwd and im putting it off because i want to savor what little literature is left i also want to do a reread of the others first because i have become more interested in asoiaf fan theory
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree definitely a toss up between affc and asos for me
asoiaf,not_removed,just a couple things i want to add acok the great ranging first visit at crasters the frostfangs jon and halfhand in the pass ending with jon ghost vs halfhand adwd reektheon in winterfellsome of the best chapters in the entire series
asoiaf,not_removed,you too i had to fight my way through adwd
asoiaf,not_removed,nuff said is it though i mean the reveal that littlefinger and lysa had been in cahoots since the beginning only cat mhysa the lady stoneheart reveal tywins murder man what a great book it even starts off with a bang the first time the horn blows times in how long
asoiaf,not_removed,do you think twow would be similar to asos full of crazy twists and turns and has a beginning middle and end im just curious to hear another fellow readers opinion seven blessings
asoiaf,not_removed,fetch me a block is iconic to this series and i hate jon chapters
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed mereen and tyrion feel like delay for the sake of delay obviously george needed the mereneese knot resolved but still i also really enjoyed davos chapter in dance
asoiaf,not_removed,mereen is great though
asoiaf,not_removed,rasoiafcirclejerk
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed
asoiaf,not_removed,whatthefuck
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah to be fair that book has too many things to actually name off the top of my head
asoiaf,not_removed,not the person you asked but ill give my two cents its going to have the end of the events of adwd and the beginning of the final act ados will have the middle and the end of the third act and series as a whole
asoiaf,not_removed,well i certainly hope so i really hope that george is able to focus the plot in a way that has a clearer ending point than adwd did the only real issue i had with adwd was all the cliffhangers if it is equal quality i will not be disappointed at all and i suspect it might be even better from the sample chapters
asoiaf,not_removed,i think winds will largely consist of amazing stuff happening it will definitely have battle of ice battle of fire dany and the dothraki resolved probably epically dany meeting tyrion a resolution of jamies predicament iron islands vs the reach jons resurrection connington aegon taking storms end and a total power vacuum in kings landing it will likely have the north rising against the boltons and freys at least one but probably multiple massive revelations from bran and bloodraven revelations from sam victarion blowing the dragon horn cerseis trial full on rebellion in dorne dany meeting marwan i also think it ends with the wall coming down that is on par with the number of big things that happen in storm and it still leaves plenty for dream and it might give us additional dragon riders
asoiaf,not_removed,wow thank you so much for showing me this sub im being serious
asoiaf,not_removed,its a copypasta that gets used every time someone mentions liking a feast for crows its pretty indicative of the worst of the fandom and its also why everyone is convinced that a feast for crows is unpopular despite its many defenders there is a small annoying minority that consistently shits on it whenever it comes up regardless circumstances
asoiaf,not_removed,great point
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah if all twow chapters were just half as awesome as the forsaken twow would be a fooking legend
asoiaf,not_removed,a resolution of jamies predicament i forgot how much i yearn for this i also think it ends with the wall coming down agreed
asoiaf,not_removed,gods winds will be amazing just cant wait until grrm finish it and release it somedaythe others take spring we dream of winter
asoiaf,not_removed,not quite that copypasta only exists because of people defending affc which aint bad it aint whats convinces people its bad
asoiaf,not_removed,lol damn its sad cuz i rly enjoy affc
asoiaf,not_removed,i meant that its that minority that copypastas this among other things is what convince people that everyone else think its bad
asoiaf,not_removed,so do i
asoiaf,not_removed,they do as compared to one through three not that its awful when considered alone people reading it is what made them think that and this is a reaction to people who pretend its the best novel ever it aint objectively ringo starr was an incredible musician unless you compare him to the other three pete best adwd
asoiaf,not_removed,what convince people that everyone else thinks that it is bad what convince people that its bad clarifying i think most people thinks its bad based on their own opinions but pissy shit like that copypasta is what convince people that everyone else thinks it bad also objectively people who think something other than chocolate is the best ice cream are wrong objectively people who think that brown is the best color are wrong popular opinion aint objective fact its pretty clearly objectively subjective people derive enjoyment from different things in the series some minority of readers clearly derive the most enjoyment out of affc that doesnt make them worthy of mockery or somehow objectively wrong it certainly doesnt make that copypasta any less vile and pathetic
asoiaf,not_removed,upvoting you for being exactly who i was talking about
asoiaf,not_removed,boltons are toast their name will be scourged from the history books
asoiaf,not_removed,starks has only a bastard a cripple a couple of girls and a lost cannibal kid there is actually other starks alive in the north grrm confirmed it in an interview there are probably some descendants of offshoot branches from the family tree floating around the north most likely in white harbor and barrowton if you look at the stark family tree from the world book there is a good chance that the descendants maybe even sons of httpsawoiafwesterosorgindexphpartosstark are still alive arryns sweetrobin has a of probability of dying before producing an heir if harry the only other person who could take the name dies too the arryn name dies with him no there is a huge amount of arryns still alive there are several branches of house arryn scattered across the vale all as proud as they are penurious save for the gulltown arryns who had the rare good sense to marry merchants theyre rich but less than couth so no one talks about them ser denys hailed from one of the poor proud branches in all likelihood harry will take the arryn name should he succeed in vale lordship he already much to robins chagrin uses a haryng waynwood arryn coat of arms greyjoys theon has no cock theons crazy uncles do not plan to have kids either because of celibacy being distracted at war or simply because they are killed them themselves asha is the only possibility no we see some greyjoy cousins with asha in adwd there is likely a good number of greyjoys still aorund a surviving sand snake could be the only chance to get someone to take the name martell again there are other martells around most notably manfrey martell the current castellan of sunspear in conclusion these major houses of westeros are not really in danger of dying out due to members maybe the characters we are familiar with may all die but there will always be other branches for these long long existing houses to take over the family name and lands the big worry is when houses lose their lands then these houses would fade into obscurity and cease to exist as westeros is a realm were only the rich and powerful the nobility can afford to have last names with no wealth and lands a house such as the tullys would likely disappear after a few generations
asoiaf,not_removed,there are a bunch of arryns in gulltown there are an ungodly number of lannisters and tyrells the rest you have a good point
asoiaf,not_removed,starks are safe the final book was originally titled a time for wolves and jojen had a dream that the starks would return in asos pretty safe bet they survive the series tyrell family is just so huge i cant see them all dying maybe a bunch of them but the whole family i cant see it martell i dont see any of the legitimate martells surviving except maybe trystane i think maybe some of ellarias younger kids will survive the two youngest are what and i dont see them fighting or any type of situations that could get them killed baratheon all the legitimate baratheons are doomed i could see edric or gendry or mya surviving and getting sl just based on them being the only ones left probably edric but gendrys reappearance in affc after the elimination of the year gap makes me think he will be important lannister there are a lot of lannisters that being said i think a lot of them will die at red a wedding the only lannisters i can see surviving are tyrion jaime maybe and little jenae since shes only like tully i think one of the tullystark kids will end up in control of riverrun and continue the tully line i think edmure and the blackfish are doomed not sure about edmures kid arryn they are in the gravest danger imo there are only two left and one is basically being poisoned to death and the other is an asshole who will probably get himself killed that being said there are the less desired arryns of gulltown who can take over if the main line collapsed and i think theyre pretty safe as they seem to stay out of things but who knows what will happen when the long night comes greyjoy i think euron asha and victarion are doomed to die i think theon will survive the series but hes a eunuch so he cant really further the family line i guess he probably has a bastard or two somewhere that could be legitimized maybe the captains daughter that he screws in acok
asoiaf,not_removed,theres a lot of lannisters left like a lot lol jaime jokes about having too many cousins to keep track of same can be said for the tyrells margaery had a lot of cousins we know of the girls she hung out with and i think a few of the boys in loras age groupcircle my list of names that are toast after this series goes greyjoy tully baratheon arryn bolton
asoiaf,not_removed,the arryns name is imo quite likely to survive because of the prestige associated with it ifwhen robin arryn croaks and harry becomes lord of the vale it would not shock me if he adopted the arryn name plus someone else mentioned the gulltown arryns the starks and tyrells are going to be fine the former because of plot armor the latter because they have a deep bench same with the lannisters theyve been around for a while and have extent cadet branches to take up the name if the core family is tapped out actually most of the great houses appear to be in this boat which makes sense considering how old most of them are the baratheons and starks are apparently the main exceptions and we may just not have been introduced to the baratheons extended family yet
asoiaf,not_removed,and a lost cannibal kid totally thought this was referring to bran again on the first read since ya know bran has already eaten people
asoiaf,not_removed,there are a ton of lannisters they are in no danger at all tyrion jaime and martyn from tytos line they also have daven damion and lucion from tytos younger brother jasons line and this isnt counting any of the many girls who could just have their children take the lannister name
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrellsfreys baratheon umbers karstarks
asoiaf,not_removed,you forgot gendry being another baratheon bastard
asoiaf,not_removed,arryns i truly think grrm will make sweetrobin survive and have strong children just because he likes the underdogs the martells will be over soon imo even though theres still plenty of oberyns bastards theyre all on dangerous missions plus the trueborn kids are betrother to contested rulerstobe cerseis bastards and the mummers dragon
asoiaf,not_removed,i would like to see jayne westerling actually be pregnant and by some series of events john ends up raising the hopefully boy to be the true stark heir i could see john taking solace in that
asoiaf,not_removed,fyi their are another branch of arryns of gull town
asoiaf,not_removed,stark are in danger but they have too much plot armor meh i would just flay them out
asoiaf,not_removed,good its a shocker that back in the age of heroes the starks didnt genocide them given the red kings had a tendency to rebel every hundred years or so proudly displaying skins of freshly killed starks as capes as hard as the starks allegedly were its odd that the boltons have lasted as long as they had
asoiaf,not_removed,and so a proud noble house dies outsometimes this loser house however will not be missed
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the boltons have already been wiped out in the show
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt there also another brother of tywins tyrek or something edit here we go tygett lannister httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphptygettlannister
asoiaf,not_removed,good post people dont realize that the characters we see arent the only people in the world
asoiaf,not_removed,for the arryns though there isnt enough of the arryn blood for them to be true heirs to the eyrie and to carry on the bloodline
asoiaf,not_removed,why are those two the exception why arent there more stark cousins
asoiaf,not_removed,lots of arryns still alive from all the scattered branches across the vale you can take them off your list
asoiaf,not_removed,who is it referring to
asoiaf,not_removed,or many of the other lannisters in lannisport
asoiaf,not_removed,there are a ton of lannisters they are in no danger at all what if we have a wedding of a lannister pretty close to the westerlands wouldnt it be likely that all the lannisters are invited to a rw in riverrun
asoiaf,not_removed,there are way too many freys for them to be wiped out
asoiaf,not_removed,karstarks as a name shouldnt be wiped unless somethng happens to the extra son that remained arnolf and co are all toasted through
asoiaf,not_removed,he is an unacknowledged bastard like many of his bastard siblings you have to be acknowledged to have any kind of claim on your parents titleslands
asoiaf,not_removed,which could work since jon would take the iron throne after aegons death
asoiaf,not_removed,no theyre not grrm has confirmed that there are starks running around in barrowton and white harbor but theyre distant from the main line
asoiaf,not_removed,they were probably too tough to root out defeat totally
asoiaf,not_removed,it really is strange to me that they didnt annihilate them
asoiaf,not_removed,good its a shocker that back in the age of heroes the starks didnt genocide them given the red kings had a tendency to rebel every hundred years or so proudly displaying skins of freshly killed starks as capes back in the age of heroes the boltons were not rebelling the starks and boltons were two rival kings
asoiaf,not_removed,whoops hes dead but his son tyrek is alive
asoiaf,not_removed,of course there is denys arryn jons heir during roberts rebellion was from one of these branches
asoiaf,not_removed,well arryns arent like the targaryens assumably the arryns are just third cousins or so from the arryns of gulltown
asoiaf,not_removed,they are the two richest and most powerful overlords of westeros more wealth means being able to keep second and even third cousins relevant with other occupations and it also means that these distant cousins will have greater opportunities to establish themselves at the nearby powerful cities of oldtown and lannisport there is probably thousands of people with stark blood in the north but they can only really call themselves starks if they can prove they are connected to the main branch and to do so takes wealth
asoiaf,not_removed,there are more stark cousins grrm confirmed it but theyre distant from the main branch
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know why do i have an ungodly number of half siblings yet my friend has no siblings at all
asoiaf,not_removed,starks have a bad habit of sending extra siblings to the wall those that keep their vows tend to not produce children
asoiaf,not_removed,jon arryn had brothers who carried his name little robyn has cousins but i dont know if they come from the same line has he does i think if he takes a tumble out of the moondoor thats it for the arryn line
asoiaf,not_removed,rickon because the skagosi are supposed to be cannibals and hes on skagos
asoiaf,not_removed,theyve been a separate family for probably hundreds of years however he was talking about the lannisters of casterly rock
asoiaf,not_removed,davens wedding i suppose its possible if lsh can plan that far ahead though im sure at least damion and lucion would stay behind at casterly rock damion is the castellan after all
asoiaf,not_removed,every single one of them doubtful
asoiaf,not_removed,thats what you think literally everyone north of the blackwater rush is gunning for them
asoiaf,not_removed,i can see all the freys dying at least from the main line theres still be cousins and such from all the houses they married into over the years
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought house thenn are taking over the karstark lands after they married the heiress
asoiaf,not_removed,true i mentioned him because he is the only one that escaped cerseis rampage as far as we know
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt he acknowledged though i know that he doesnt know that bobby b is his dad but the king paid for his apprenticeship through arryn and cersei immediately went after him when robert died
asoiaf,not_removed,unlikely either dany takes the throne and jon becomes king through her or he doesnt become king and no one sits the iron throne
asoiaf,not_removed,the world book makes me hate the boltons so much more im on my first series read through and you can kinda see how shitty they are
asoiaf,not_removed,the greystarks and boltons allied in a rebellion against the starks the starks killed off the greystarks but left the boltons
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrek disappeared during the riot of kings landing
asoiaf,not_removed,is one of them named tony
asoiaf,not_removed,ahh ok thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,they could put a temporal castellan like rodrick one that does not have family ties to a guy who is marrying next door
asoiaf,not_removed,doubtful but possible even the weird uncle who lives at the other end of the country and who you have only seen once can appear at weddings
asoiaf,not_removed,the vale rivelands iron islands crownlands and westerlands you are mistaken the north and some of the riverlands that is it o
asoiaf,not_removed,i have a feeling gendry or edric will be used a pawn for aegons regime in order to pacify the stormlands
asoiaf,not_removed,the king did not pay for his apprenticeship it is is suspected that varys placed him there and kept tabs on him and being acknowledged is a legal term robert secretly sending gendry money he didnt is not acknowledgement a declaration that this is my trueborn sondaughter is and robert only ever did that for one child edric after the florents made him
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty dogmatic belief dany will never sut iron throne jon is the only character with a parallel to king arthur pendragon
asoiaf,not_removed,they didnt leave off the boltons they were just unable to finish them off we know that the dreafort was able to withhold a stark seige for two years two years is a long time for the stark soldiers to be away from their harvests and potential other problems for their lands it would have been in the starks best interests to compromise at that point the boltons were simply more powerful than the greystarks
asoiaf,not_removed,its possible i suppose though with kevans recent death i doubt martyn and his sister will be going anywhere to celebrate
asoiaf,not_removed,why would the wedding be at riverrun and not in the westerlands
asoiaf,not_removed,virtually all of the riverlords almost all of them had men among robb or edmures guards
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think the seven kingdoms are going to be united going forward at least until the very end
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry i completely missed the politicallegal part of it my point was simply that many of the families are aware that robert had a bastard son in kl my bad
asoiaf,not_removed,thats cool but grrm isnt copying everything for or else id mention how daenerys resembles henry tudor more than jon does no one would accept jon by himself because he has no conclusive proof he will be calling the very honorable ned stark a liar telling people at the heels of aegon will make people look at him as an opportunistic bastard and copycat jon is unsuited to the south at best he can remain king in the north and the other regions have no reason to follow jon even if he helps squash the others
asoiaf,not_removed,ever consider that in all likelihood jon or dany could die in the end if anything grrm makes parallels only to subvert them in the end
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty dogmatic belief dany will never sut iron throne i suppose its only dogmatic when you disagree with it
asoiaf,not_removed,hes marrying a frey freys and lannisters are to attend riverrun is under emmon frey genna lannisters control in the current situation the crown would want the lannister army and devan nearby so they wont return to the westerlands for this
asoiaf,not_removed,no not really thirtyfive hundred they were thirtyfive hundred who had been blooded in the whispering wood who had reddened their swords at the battle of the camps at oxcross ashemark and the crag and all through the goldrich hills of the lannister west aside from her brother edmures modest retinue of friends the lords of the trident had remained to hold the riverlands while the king retook the north a lot of the riverlords are actually intermarried with the freys while some of the riverland houses will certainly have animosity towards the freys and the majority charltons and vyprens not withstanding may offer zero support if the freys are attacked but gunning for them is clearly hyperbolic
asoiaf,not_removed,helps jon is the one who will defeat the other he is the last hero reborn having a flaming sword most likely going to be riding a dragon and defeating the others will probably make people listen to you about your parentage
asoiaf,not_removed,just proved point
asoiaf,not_removed,he is marrying a frey from the twins not riverrun the wedding would be either at the twins or in the westerlands there is no real reason why it would be at emmon freys new castle
asoiaf,not_removed,well excluding frey vassals but all the major riverlords are gunning for them bracken lost a bstard son and some cousins blackwood lost a son mallister has a son taken hostage piper lost a son and vance as well i belive that is virtually every major riverland house that wasnt extinct exiled or down to a cowardly lord and his daughter darry extinct in the male line whents last lady was forced forced out of harenhal and most likely dead and lord moonton is said to be a coward unlike his late brother ser myles who was killed by robert at the battle of the bells
asoiaf,not_removed,and if he were here hed consume the others with fireballs from his eyes and bolts of lightning from his arse
asoiaf,not_removed,you mean aa reborn right bran is closer to the last hero than jon is and we still dont know whether jon is aa or not people have to care about the others it seems like they wont make it past the trident people will have to want to follow jon you can save someone from annihilation and still not earn their loyalty jon will have to want to tell people that hes rhaegars son jon wouldnt know how to navigate the politics of the soufh he got himself murdered after less than a year as lc of less than people people will have to care that hes the son of rhaegar after aegon comes and fails jon may not even survive the series how are the northerners going to feel when jon reveals that he duped them jons only route to becoming king of the iron throne is through daenerys
asoiaf,not_removed,what are you talking about
asoiaf,not_removed,well excluding frey vassals but all the major riverlords are gunning for them while lord charlton is a vassal lord vypren is not he is merely married to one of walders daughters bracken lost a bstard harry rivers was killed by the lannisters before the red wedding and some cousins at the red wedding i dont recall that being mentioned blackwood lost a son and he also has relatives with the freys and kinslaying is just as dishonourable as breaking guest rights while he certainly has serious grievances with them gunning is a huge exaggeration as was your earlier assertion that everyone north of the blackwater rush was gunning for them mallister has a son taken hostage mallister himself is now a hostage hostage taking is part and parcel of warfare piper lost a son not at the red wedding he didnt marq was taken prisoner and vance as well i belive not a son an unknown member of the family one lord vance does not have any sons while the others sons are all alive that is virtually every major riverland house that wasnt extinct exiled or down to a cowardly lord and his daughter no it really is not i dont know why you constantly make these kind of statements these things are not that hard to check
asoiaf,not_removed,braveheart was a shitty movie but had some pretty memorable lines
asoiaf,not_removed,how when she will never sit the iron throne and is the one who is more likely to die the other may not physically be there but they will feel the unnatural cold and darkness to save the realm he will do what he must jon never duped anyone in fact he was duped the son of the heir comes before the heirs siblings
asoiaf,not_removed,bracken mentioned some lost kin at the red wedding while talking to jaime his kin among the freys are dead now thanks to lord manderly and the bwb fair enough i thought marq was dead and vance lost a son
asoiaf,not_removed,prove that daenerys will never sit the iron throne it doesnt matter what jon intentionally did its what the others will think
asoiaf,not_removed,the bastard son of the heir and the girl he kidnapped comes before no one
asoiaf,not_removed,bracken mentioned some lost kin at the red wedding while talking to jaime not bracken that was lucas blackwood his kin among the freys are dead now thanks to lord manderly and the bwb no they are not alyssa blackwood had children with walder and grandchildren two of her sons married into house paege
asoiaf,not_removed,what do you think is more memorable a warrior king who thought he was a bastard but turned out to be the rightful king and the savior of the realm or a mad dragon queen out to steal her nephews throne i will give you a hint we still see a certain english kings legends as the ideal of chivalry and the foundation of english literature
asoiaf,not_removed,targs can marry multiple women the kingsguard swore their vows to baby jon not viserys on dragonstone meaning that jon is the rightful king also women have no right to iron throne
asoiaf,not_removed,the latter actually is much more memorable from a story telling perspective the former is a welltread trope besides grrm has already done what you imagined but with aegon with the caveat that hes actually fake because the warrior king come back to reclaim his rightful throne is propaganda this says it better than me becausejons heritage has way more meaning in the story than just a claim to the crown because rlj is about the tragic stories of those three characters and also ned kinda baffled by the question tbh dyou really think every plot and character decision orbits around who wins the game moreover i think grrm wrote aegon and his storyline in such a way to critique the notion that jon would one day wear a crown as rhaegars son aegon is following precisely that game plan after all except that arc is a lie planted in his head by tyrion and will end up getting aegon killed the return of the rightful heir here is a selfconscious trope a propaganda ploy cooked up by varys its not what the story is actually about
asoiaf,not_removed,there is a difference between trope and foundation of english literature the arthurian legends are powerful tools that inspire us
asoiaf,not_removed,i have never seen grrm state that asoiaf was meant to follow arthurian legends where are you getting this
asoiaf,not_removed,martin has said that he grew on stories of knights in shining armor saving the damsel in distress and jons parallels to king arthur are too many to dispute i am not saying martin ever said that it will end exactly like the arthurian legends but he is definitely taking some influence from them
asoiaf,not_removed,of course he is taking influence from them but youre pushing it like its fact when its just one of many possibilities i dont think jon will take any throne as jon targaryen no one will believe him any throne hed take will be as jon stark and thats if he gets the iron throne theres a very large possibility he plain dies in the end jon following rhaegar in his footsteps of what couldve been the king of westeros sacrificing his life and ambitions to save a humanity that wont even remember it thatd be a true hero
asoiaf,not_removed,you do realize a large part of asoiaf is deconstructing works of traditional fantasy right
asoiaf,not_removed,martin still uses some of old ideas of fantasy but with a more human twist to it ie jons self doubt about being able to lead when he is lord commander
asoiaf,not_removed,stories like neds or robbs or quentyns are specifically there to deconstruct and destiny fantasy ideals
asoiaf,not_removed,ned and robb i see but quentyn i dont see personally it seems to me that martin is striving for a balamce between tradtional fantasy and realism
asoiaf,not_removed,you would probably like httpslucifermeanslightbringercom
asoiaf,not_removed,so u mean rhaegars dick is lightbringer than
asoiaf,not_removed,i think that as it stands with the information given or implied that there is nothing to suggest that there needs or will be an actual lightbringer in fact mel who seems to know her beans is pretty happy to have a fake lightbringer for stannis to me this would imply that the actual prophecy doesnt suggest its an actual or needed part of aa returning i think she gives it to him more as a pr stunt to help associate him with the prophecy like one of the trappings of power she talks about actually possibly something telling is that she thinks that in relation to jon and how he seems to avoid them maybe that is a subtle way of pointing out to the reader that the real aa would not need these things at all
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis flaming fake sword is one of the clues we get saying that melisandre might be a bit more sinister than we think
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe shes just a fanatic which is equally dangerous she has this prophecy she think stannis is the one and since some pieces are missing she just filled in the blanks
asoiaf,not_removed,we know that lord umber sent his son hother to oldtown to study though it didnt work out due to his interest in murdering prostitutes so people who worship the old gods go there too given the norths remoteness probably not too big a number
asoiaf,not_removed,idk but i think that as learned men they would not let their order be a tool for the faith also i dont know where i got the idea that there are some red priests in oldtown
asoiaf,not_removed,no there are plenty of maesters from the north and iron islands also it seems like many maesters dont believe in any of those stuff as well
asoiaf,not_removed,northerners and iron islands folk sometimes dont trust maesters so it seems less common especially since you wont be getting to visit them on holiday or anything like you would in dorne or the reach but at least some had other faiths
asoiaf,not_removed,no all because oldtown is where the citadel and the faith are located dosent mean theyre intertwined at all
asoiaf,not_removed,generally they seem to come hand in hand there are some northern houses that are team old gods that have maesters but usually if you dont support the faith you dont have maesters for much of their history they shared one city as the home base of each organization and one principal financial backer in house hightower i would say they are on the same team
asoiaf,not_removed,also the seven came with the first men i beleive the maesters were already there before then
asoiaf,not_removed,i think pate talked about nightfires and red priests in the prologue of a feast for crows
asoiaf,not_removed,or do believe but dont put that in the matters of their work the ironbon maester who saves dunk from drowning tells him about a very religious act without ever commenting the religious part he doesent speak a world about religion but just act out as a medic who knows tricks to save people we can also see that scientifical approach in their treating of the cotf and giants a spiritual backround would have peppered their speech with faith allusions but thats the way i see it
asoiaf,not_removed,there are some northern houses that are team old gods that have maesters but usually if you dont support the faith you dont have maesters what are you basing that on the faith and the maesters are very different organizations with very different goals and theres been no indication they go handandhand
asoiaf,not_removed,the seven was brought to westeros by the andals
asoiaf,not_removed,each morning at first light the red priests gathered to welcome the sun outside their modest wharfside temple for the night is dark and full of terrors pate had heard them cry those words a hundred times asking their god rhllor to save them from the darkness affc prologue
asoiaf,not_removed,the iron islands are not in the faith and they dont have maesters
asoiaf,not_removed,crap thats what i meant to type xd
asoiaf,not_removed,cool thanks its been a while since i have read feast
asoiaf,not_removed,that has nothing to do with the faith it has to do with the iron islands being xenophobic assholes who dont like outsiders or ways different from their own
asoiaf,not_removed,they do actually they just dont respect them that much
asoiaf,not_removed,it may be a coincidence but it is the general rule
asoiaf,not_removed,no its not the north doesnt follow the faith outside of white harbour and they have plenty of maesters
asoiaf,not_removed,its only the general rule because the ironborn keep getting lords who decide to kick them all out balons father bought maesters to the islands and i dont think its too big of a stretch to assume that when balon reversed most of his fathers reforms that he kicked the maesters out too he did seem to blame his younger brothers death on the maester who treated his gangrenous hand
asoiaf,not_removed,as i said thats the exception
asoiaf,not_removed,awoiaf says that he kept them since theyre quite useful
asoiaf,not_removed,there are only two regions in westeros that are not predominantly faithworshipping one has maesters and one doesnt so your argument that the maesters are not generally found outside of faithworshipping areas rests on a rule of one place
asoiaf,not_removed,they need to pay for food and stuff so they probably have to do some sort of work but apart from that they just need to turn up and have a dick
asoiaf,not_removed,if i recall correctly there is no nomination you study in the citadel and go through exams like an uni so anyone who is accepted can be a maester
asoiaf,not_removed,someone has to be able and willing to pay for you that disqualifies nearly all commoners
asoiaf,not_removed,is there any hint at all what house maester luwin is from
asoiaf,not_removed,to become a maester you have to earn a bunch of links to make a chain to earn a link you have to demonstrate your proficiency in a certain field to the archmaester of that field while theoretically this is all based on merit in practice the archmaesters seem to at least be a little bit incesty and highborn and the best and quickest way to become a maester is probably by brownnosing your way to the top and also being the son of someone important
asoiaf,not_removed,there is a ritual upon which the applicant must prove his worth catching a fish the most important part of which is how well he baits his hook the judges want to know how well the maester baits
asoiaf,not_removed,we dont know for sure but it makes sense that there is a barrier to keep commoners out of some kind sure some may get in but i cant imagine they let just anybody in
asoiaf,not_removed,how does the nights watch pay for someone to become a maester or is it just a normal sworn duty to accept whoever they send
asoiaf,not_removed,so there is no chance we can get maester theon
asoiaf,not_removed,then how did pate the pig boy afford to first go to the citadel and then spend years doing jack shit
asoiaf,not_removed,its probably more the fact that most commoners are illiterate or otherwise uneducated that bars them from the citadel money doesnt seem to be much of a problem if you can actually get there
asoiaf,not_removed,is this said somewhere that someone has to pay for youyou have to be able to pay something or do you mean that you just have to manage your payment for food i really dont remember
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,source for having to pay
asoiaf,not_removed,incesty
asoiaf,not_removed,this is a parallel to hot pies story hot pie is en route to becoming a true master baker
asoiaf,not_removed,they gave token consideration for two commoner maesters for the position of grand maester before choosing a tyrell candidate according to varys it was to satisfy themselves about their focus on merit so even if its not that much the truth their ideals at least are about worth determined by ability it sounds more like the cost of living and poor education keeps most out with the people making the rules not too worried about that rather than formal rules to explicitly keep out people who arent from a noble family
asoiaf,not_removed,probably the fact that almost all commoners are illiterate
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty sure they just ask the citadel for one jon mentions that he means to ask for multiple maesters to replace aemon while sam is in training
asoiaf,not_removed,or grey worm
asoiaf,not_removed,i think people have been wondering that for years
asoiaf,not_removed,you can probably pay your own way by working around the citadel and old town to earn some cash to pay for your room
asoiaf,not_removed,no its not said in the text
asoiaf,not_removed,pycelle is also a son of cersei and jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,im guessing this is why he continues tending to archmaester walgrave and looking after the ravens even after it becomes clear neither will earn him a link its likely either in lieu of him having to pay for attendance or else he earns some small recompense to pay for food and the like
asoiaf,not_removed,time traveled together with tyrions fetus
asoiaf,not_removed,glad to see that my favorite theory is still alive and well
asoiaf,not_removed,i would say a dissolving of the crowns power over the seven kingdoms would do more harm than good during the books westeros is in perpetual civil war due to the nature of bad blood between families and getting rid of any common bond would do more harm than good westeros history does have long periods of peace and thats usually at the behest of a great leader of course the best solution would be to replace the crown with a democratic republic but that wouldnt be very fun or interesting
asoiaf,not_removed,well if laying one sword across your lap indicates refusal of guest right and the possible protection of the dead from possession by others as in the winterfell crypt what might sitting on iron swords represent the opposite please come in and drive me mad it might be best if the thing is destroyed maybe tossed in a heart of a large volcano d
asoiaf,not_removed,the whole reason why the iron throne is such a gaudy monstrosity is because aegon wanted to craft the most imposing and uncomfortable chair possible its a massive display of power to those viewing the king but its uncomfortable as fuck to the monarch sitting the throne as kingship should represent a central display of strength for the populace and a hardship for the ruler whether anybody wants the iron throne to remain would largely depend on how they actually view its true purpose is it a reminder to the population who owns the swords or is it a reminder to the ruler who has the duty or is it as aegon envisioned both because someone concerned only with strength would likely try and cushion it but keep it someone concerned with duty would probably keep the idea of an uncomfortable chair but not the swords and monstrous size and someone concerned with both would probably keep it or make a similar construct as an aside though ive always found it funny that ned of all people also complained about the iron throne and basically told aegon to go fuck himself once he finally had to sit it just as robert had complained about the throne at the start of the books he sat high upon the immense ancient seat of aegon the conqueror an ironwork monstrosity of spikes and jagged edges and grotesquely twisted metal it was as robert had warned him a hellishly uncomfortable chair and never more so than now with his shattered leg throbbing more sharply every minute the metal beneath him had grown harder by the hour and the fanged steel behind made it impossible to lean back a king should never sit easy aegon the conqueror had said when he commanded his armorers to forge a great seat from the swords laid down by his enemies damn aegon for his arrogance ned thought sullenly and damn robert and his hunting as well ned is considered one of the best rulers in the series and even he was like fuck this chair even while knowing full well exactly why aegon had made it so
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think anyone but daenerys could destroy the iron throne and hold on to power thats because in order for the transfer of power through right of conquest to work there has to be some physical object that represents the power of the monarchy you become king by taking the iron throne no throne and theres nothing to take
asoiaf,not_removed,of course dany will have one of the dragons melt it she did want to break the wheel after all
asoiaf,not_removed,uh you mean the specific throne no i dont see anyone getting rid of it its a major cultural artifact im surprised no one ever got around to grinding the blades down so they werent a hazard though if i was king id have the blacksmith in there in the evenings making it a bit more comfortable do it on the sly if you have to
asoiaf,not_removed,you cant go straight from a feudal society to a democratic one wouldnt work first the power needs to be stripped from the feudal lords i think the most logical transition for westeros would be into an absolute monarchy that is a monarchy where all power belongs to the monarch and nobody else think ancien régime in france
asoiaf,not_removed,democracy is terrible what westros needs is a constitutional republic with a constitution that is almost word for word in line with the us constitution
asoiaf,not_removed,i meant the actual physical throne
asoiaf,not_removed,i would think destroying the throne would be a larger display of power than sitting in it it would be the ultimate power move to take it and then destroy it
asoiaf,not_removed,they could have each of the great houses have some sort of representation in some sort of senate based in kl
asoiaf,not_removed,they need george washington to lead the humans in the long night
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly jamie is top complex characters in the series only tyrion and cat are above him truly great stuff and what affcadwd was lacking when it came to the new characters
asoiaf,not_removed,hi ive removed this post because while its ok to mention a characters name in a title it is a spoiler to confirm whether a character is deadalive ex confirming a character is still appearing as a pov
asoiaf,not_removed,if hbo released a documentary just full of extended versions of these lores and stories i would buy it in a heartbeat
asoiaf,not_removed,the only way to get to asshai is via sheep and goods are brought in via sheep i wonder how many sheeps in their fleet
asoiaf,not_removed,very informative but hard to understand with his accent
asoiaf,not_removed,you can find more videos about asoiaf lore in this post
asoiaf,not_removed,neat accent i didnt have a problem understanding its awoiaf chapter reading
asoiaf,not_removed,really english isnt even my first language but i had no trouble with it
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre not even filming it everyone just hates alfie allen
asoiaf,not_removed,alfie allen dont we normally have pads for this director yeah that would really mess up the shot
asoiaf,not_removed,iron islanders really like those grey bath robes
asoiaf,not_removed,im happy that theon is back to being a bitch like theon instead of being a bitch like reek
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre going to color grade the wiley ole shit out of that shot so much grey and blue and slate tones poured all over it
asoiaf,not_removed,leave theon alone
asoiaf,not_removed,well when has theon ever had a good day since his sausage got cut off
asoiaf,not_removed,hes the butters of westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,i need to stop looking at all these set spoilers
asoiaf,not_removed,theon his ass
asoiaf,not_removed,oh look i thought theon would be back to being his normal self again after he was brutally tortured by ramsay but looks like not anymore
asoiaf,not_removed,good theon turncloak
asoiaf,not_removed,thought that was jon beating him at first
asoiaf,not_removed,i bet it has something to do with moat cailin
asoiaf,not_removed,man the security on set must be shiiiit how do these shots keep getting out
asoiaf,not_removed,is the actor beating him someone familiar any familiar faces there or only ironborns
asoiaf,not_removed,part of me believes the producers are aware of the media attention and photographs so theyre intentionally filming scenes that wont necessarily be in the new season
asoiaf,not_removed,it could be worse they could decide to cut his dick offoh thats riiiiight
asoiaf,not_removed,welp i am now terrified for the likelihood of theon surviving this season
asoiaf,not_removed,whos kicking his ass
asoiaf,not_removed,cant this get even more fanservice unrealisticjusticporn predictable
asoiaf,not_removed,oye patxi que estan haciendo los americanos pues no sé parece que le estan zurrando a alguien en la playa
asoiaf,not_removed,what a great ac oh
asoiaf,not_removed,reek reek it rhymes with meek
asoiaf,not_removed,ok aaand take
asoiaf,not_removed,terry cloth is the top choice of the stylish and functional raider
asoiaf,not_removed,it was actually hilarious for a couple of months after they raided fashion week at milan but those clothes didnt really hold up to raiding and the ocean life so back to grey robes it was
asoiaf,not_removed,browns and greys everyones gotta be wearing dark colours because they all live in the middle ages really though the idea that everyone in ye olden times wore various shades of leather and frequently bathed themselves in feces is a hollywood meme that really needs to die
asoiaf,not_removed,im confident hell earn his wang back any episode now
asoiaf,not_removed,flair checks out
asoiaf,not_removed,how else would i know if im watching the greyjoys
asoiaf,not_removed,and then he shaves his head and waves his umbrella at you menacingly
asoiaf,not_removed,the day he met dany went alright
asoiaf,not_removed,oh hamburgers
asoiaf,not_removed,hey butters doesnt deserve any of the bad things that happen to him
asoiaf,not_removed,lets hope he doesnt attempt to summon biggie smalls
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean is the theon getting his ass kicked somehow a major spoiler at this point really
asoiaf,not_removed,im eating them up
asoiaf,not_removed,this discussion is offtopic please go to the spoilers infinite thread if you want to discuss other leaksrumors
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont get this complaint if he was like old theon people would complain it happened to fast and the show didnt earn it if he is still reeky then his character isnt changing fast enough and he should be more like theon no win theon did one courageous thing and had to be talked into everything else by his sister he clearly isnt a whole person yet and may never be
asoiaf,not_removed,cant say i blame him the guy needs lots of therapy
asoiaf,not_removed,you mean the old theon who thinks he is better than anybody else fucks everyhting that moves willing or not after all he is a lord and they are peasants and didnt even manage to do backstabbing right if he was anywhere close to old theon just about anybody in the series would just murder him pure liability without practical use just a halfbaked unsullied and dany got of better ones
asoiaf,not_removed,thats nothing sansa is getting married off the wight walkers
asoiaf,not_removed,i am assuming you stated this with sarcasm otherwise how would theon ever be back to himself again without his favorite appendage
asoiaf,not_removed,they know my name
asoiaf,not_removed,theres a lot of area to cover and from what i hear they dont want security to be too mean because they want to keep a good relationship with the towns and areas they film in so that they can come back if need be
asoiaf,not_removed,looks like a bunch of pissed ironborn who are tired of getting the shit end of the deal
asoiaf,not_removed,they dont have time to pull something like that off or even react to the leaks the schedule for writingfilmingediting takes an entire year
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think they are worried about how much is getting out from these filming leaks next season is episodes thats about minutes of television assuming standard length episodes and they dont go crazy and do longer episodes weve seen what may end up being minutes of filming and heard none of the dialogue its not the end of the world compared to what will be filmed in studio and on closed secluded seta
asoiaf,not_removed,i bet it can thats why im not even that bummed about seeing these spoilers so far nothings been spoiled for me
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,reek reek it rhymes with guys we arent even filming this week
asoiaf,not_removed,it makes sense really peacefull hippie planet light browns and beige planet at war dark browns and grey the production designer is on point
asoiaf,not_removed,those are iron born i thought they looked like freys
asoiaf,not_removed,the vast majority of people in the middle ages were fucking disgusting though nobles were better than most but by our standards they were still pretty grossthat rhymed they for the most part did wear super bright colours but theyd look ridiculous on film so i welcome the change
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm so about those chapters with victarion and the red pries dd oh we know grrm but euron hasnt lost any appendages in the sho dd oh we know grrm well the only other character who has is dd ohwe know
asoiaf,not_removed,as long as it gets taken away a second time id love to see that too
asoiaf,not_removed,tbh im always sad when i think about how ill never see theon bang again
asoiaf,not_removed,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
asoiaf,not_removed,forgot this happened for a second such different worlds are coming together im so fucking excited
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion was an ass to him though
asoiaf,not_removed,and watching his sister get laid wasnt a bad day per se
asoiaf,not_removed,oh hamburgers pork sausages ftfy
asoiaf,not_removed,plus even normal theon wouldve gotten the shit beaten out of him by euron
asoiaf,not_removed,because while realistic it isnt compelling the truth of the matter is that this is a tv show with a limited amount of time especially since we are down to episodes having a subplot where the whole point is to show that theon has ptsd ends up feeling like it is meandering and a waste of resources it especially hurts since theon has a fantastic moment in the winterfell godswood in the books and that seems to have been scrapped from the show
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe he purchased a convincing prosthetic in mereen
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know i mean for this where you have fakefighting and fake blood i dont think they could pull that off but smaller things theyd have time for
asoiaf,not_removed,same
asoiaf,not_removed,its so catchy
asoiaf,not_removed,shes a bit of a cow though
asoiaf,not_removed,it doesnt really help when everyone has the same colour palette going on one thing i liked about season was that you could immediately tell which army you were with by their armour and colours now everything is grey or brown dark browns and more dark browns and browns and greys
asoiaf,not_removed,is there something from the books i dont remember i dont get this
asoiaf,not_removed,snip snap snip snap
asoiaf,not_removed,a moment of appreciation as i just sang your flair in my head
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know i find characters that are strong with moments of weakness or weak with moments of strength far more compelling than static characters that do one thing and forever changed
asoiaf,not_removed,ffs we barely even know the context of this scene can we please reserve judgement until we actually watch the episode
asoiaf,not_removed,and wanking which is ironic
asoiaf,not_removed,dont be a dick
asoiaf,not_removed,hey the boltons had those conquistador helmets at least and the tyrells footmen had very shiny armor
asoiaf,not_removed,victarion lost a hand theon lost something far more important both can ideally be replaced with some red fire magic
asoiaf,not_removed,you have no idea the physical toll that three vasectomies have on a person
asoiaf,not_removed,something is wrong with you people
asoiaf,not_removed,hes not really strong with moments of weakness hes weak with one moment of strength
asoiaf,not_removed,theon has had one real moment of strength though and after that it has just been reek redux the point is it doesnt feel like theon has changed it doesnt feel like he progressed he is essentially as you said static
asoiaf,not_removed,she made a song to humiliate her little brother including but not limited to making him look like a little puppet if thats not being a cow i dont know what is
asoiaf,not_removed,and the lannisters still have the purplered armor and the somehow liony helmets i think
asoiaf,not_removed,it was victarion not euron
asoiaf,not_removed,wait what vic didnt lose a hand unless you mean that fire elemental arm is a replacement of some kind
asoiaf,not_removed,ok i understand thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,the thing is sure he saves sansa and acts strong around yara but thats completely different than facing euron for one thing sansa and yara are women whom theon can trust especially yara he knows that he can be safe around her that things will be ok with her euron is basically taking that safety away which gives theon even less of a reason to change
asoiaf,not_removed,theon is broken and has moments of strength he had a moment of courage to jump with sansa but not the courage to fight he had the courage to go back to the iron islands but needs his sister to build him up to faceoff against euron next season he will cower from euron and at some point late in the season do something closer to courageous he can face death just not fight to live and dont forget the timeframe he was reek for for and half years on the show and probably covers a couple of months maybe at most
asoiaf,not_removed,the show does this with many of their characters jon was essentially jon again brooding jaded down on his luck jon dany is dany but with larger dragons jaime is stuck in jaime is he good is he bad whats he gonna do next tyrion is tyrion having a knack for ruling and drinking games davos is good smuggler davos always trying to convince people to do the right thing arya is arya vengeful but with more training sansa is almost the only character with any kind of true arc where her experiences have changed her its not surprising in the context of what weve seen aired so far theon would regress to getting beat up by other ironborn
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe its a joke and hes ok with it
asoiaf,not_removed,fixed sorry its too early to be commenting
asoiaf,not_removed,arya is arya nah arya wasnt a cold blooded murderer in
asoiaf,not_removed,to be fair that is a major theme in the books too to go forward you must go back characters have purposely been put in similar situations in order to make differentbetter decisions it is very reflective of grrms circular writing especially as so many people on this subreddit expect more repeating motifs with sansa ashford theory or even the white walkers making it to the trident
asoiaf,not_removed,davos is good smuggler davos always trying to convince people to do the right thing can you explain how he was different before ive always found davos kind of a broken record of a character but maybe im missing something
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont really think this is bad writing so much as the show shows a lot of how easy and comfortable it can be to fit into your old self when the world is falling down around you it feels good to slip into old patterns
asoiaf,not_removed,is he okay with it was he at the time
asoiaf,not_removed,you only fixed half of itx
asoiaf,not_removed,naw she was just telling a cold blooded murderer to kill for her at least now when she sentences someone she does it herself
asoiaf,not_removed,im musing over a hypothesis that if you take davos and examine his scenes theres a certain percentage of scenes where if that scene ended with davos saying the words do the right thing that line would fit perfectly well into the architecture of the scene to close it out i think over the progression of show that percentage has been steadily increasing an effect known as httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainflanderization kudos to usamr for helping me remember the term he talks about other things in with how stannis made him his hand his relationship with his son his relationship with sallador sure he advocates to convince davos to leave melisandre behind on dragonstone but thats only one piece of davos overall personification it continually grows in with gendry and the nights watch at the end but theres also the shireen element thrown in there which is good and are some of his better moments its all about davos convincing stannis how to do things and his speech at the iron bank then in he gets more into this with even a whole awkward scene with jon where he tries to convince him to take more interest in the affairs of the realm by nearly every scene is davos trying to convince someone to do something edd go get the wildlings melisandre use black magic jon you need to fight the boltons lyanna you need to join jon jon you need to get rid of melisandre the only significant dialogue heavy scene i can think off of the top of my head davos features in where this doesnt happen is the tormund scene where they talk of kings which is one of the better scenes of the season i thought to some extent this theme happens in adwd as well because of davos missions lord borrell let me go davos i lord manderly join stannis davos iii but thats still only half of his chapters davos ii is all about the tavern sequence and gathering scuttlebut to know the lay of the land davos iv is all about davos being convinced to find rickon but even if you have a character who is primarily an advisor they still need more to do than just primarily give counsel to their liege i doubt davos will follow this same path in twow due to never having met jon before
asoiaf,not_removed,yes hes ok it took seconds to google find out he said said hes cool with it if you have a sibling youll know that ribbing is common didnt realise you were the defend alfie allen because i know him and his relationship with his sister intimately club president
asoiaf,not_removed,she was a child who just lost her dad she wasnt going to be the most levelheaded
asoiaf,not_removed,thank you for spelling that out thats why i feel hes a broken record hes almost always arguing morals and making persuasive arguments there are really fresh moments in between like learning to read with shireen but too many of his scenes feel identical
asoiaf,not_removed,still basically the same thing she was either sentencing people to death or later killing them herself either way the people are dead directly because of her she is still their murderer
asoiaf,not_removed,if she killed robert too early jon arryn or stannis would have become regent until joffrey comes of age she might be forced to remarry someone even worse one who she cant control
asoiaf,not_removed,joffrey was too young she wanted him ie her to be ruling in his own right not with a regent
asoiaf,not_removed,she wasnt planning on killing robert until it became obvious ned was onto her secret sure she hated him and probably thought about killing him when jon arryn was alive but why would she risk her own life her son was going to become king so she had too much to lose and too little to gain before ned arrived once her life and her childrens lives were threatened she had everything to lose and took the risk
asoiaf,not_removed,the parable of the old bull and the young bull while standing upon a large burn an old bull and a young bull are surveying a valley full of finelooking calves the young bull can barely believe his eyes and he is getting worked up each calf looks better than the last finally unable to stand it any longer the young bull looks over to the old bull and says lets run down there and fuck one of em the old bull collects himself squints his eyes slowly finishes his own survey and says lets walk down and fuck them all
asoiaf,not_removed,jon arryn was too powerful and had played the game for decades
asoiaf,not_removed,this whole thing was set in motion by littlefinger and varyscersei is just another pawn who took her chance when she saw it and in all honesty she prob could have just waited for robert to kill himself if ned hadnt sped her need up to see joff on the throne
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei often gets the blame for roberts death and theres no question she wanted it but the plot to get him drunk and stuck by a boar was lucky as hell boars make terrible assassins the hunt could have gone half a hundred different ways mayhaps they found nothing or a timid boar that ran away instead of attacking mayhaps robert cold have hit his mark anyway or the boar could have struck a nonlethal blow mayhaps barristan could have struck the boar before it threatened his king the plot to get him drunk was a longshot a dream scenario for cersei that came to happen by chancewill of the godsplot reasons there is no evidence that she hadnt been pulling the same kind of thing for years with less lucky results robert certainly wouldnt complain about getting too drunk
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its a stretch to call anything she does a plan id say something more like notion she lacks the forsight or strategic planning ability or sobriety to plan much of anything except her next glass of wine
asoiaf,not_removed,she was trying to kill him all along from when the books start she tried to get him to fight in the tournament to presumably die then got him drunk on a hunt to die
asoiaf,not_removed,and his death gave her the opportunity to step up her assassination attempts up until asos and littlefinger admitting to kickstarting it all i was pretty convinced that cersei had poisoned him herself
asoiaf,not_removed,theres a suggestion that she tried to have him assassinated in the melee as well
asoiaf,not_removed,what is your opinion about popular theory that someone warged into mentioned boar
asoiaf,not_removed,depends on when were talking about imo after joffreys death sure she went into a downward spiral of narcissism paranoia and alcohol but i dont think she was always as batshit and worth noting we dont have her pov in agot
asoiaf,not_removed,except the first attempt that we know of is after arryns death which fits in im not saying that there werent other attempts before but theres not textual support for it the guy above me says it better sure she hated him and probably thought about killing him when jon arryn was alive but why would she risk her own life while jon was alive and still ignorant it was safer just to wait until joffrey came of age
asoiaf,not_removed,im leaning towards the possibility that the boar was a faceless man in disguise payed for with cerseis maidenhead
asoiaf,not_removed,nah she was always crazy before affc she was just limited by what she could do and checked by many people that held more power than she did still the notion that cersei cant plan anything is unfair her plans are silly and rarely work but she does plan a lot
asoiaf,not_removed,my interpretation is that it was always a matter of degrees she may have been worse as time went on but she was always a paranoid and narcissistic loose cannon imo
asoiaf,not_removed,hi please post your costume in our halloween thread instead
asoiaf,not_removed,i fookin love it
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think gregor is undead i think qyburn kept him alive by a thread did some freaky psuedoscience magic shit on him and now he serves he is still alive in a way because he never died would be interesting he he doesnt remember anything compare that with lady stoneheart she is undead and she remembers
asoiaf,not_removed,upvote solely for title then i read
asoiaf,not_removed,i always thought it was weird that people discounted cleganebowl because they thought it had to happen in a trial by combat these two are on a collision course it was hate that drove him though he committed many sins he never sought forgiveness where other men dream of love or wealth or glory this man sandor clegane dreamed of slaying his own brother a sin so terrible it makes me shudder just to speak of it yet that was the bread that nourished him the fuel that kept his fires burning ignoble as it was the hope of seeing his brothers blood upon his blade was all this sad and angry creature lived for and even that was taken from him when prince oberyn of dorne stabbed ser gregor with a poisoned spear i think the hound needs to a face his brother and b face fire by the end of the series where and how either of these happen i have no idea
asoiaf,not_removed,the whole theme they were pushing in season is rebirth i can see more of a redemptiontype arc with epic sacrifice theres been speculation that jaime will face the mountain with the hound bran had had a vision that seems to promote this theory i see the hound realizing that they cant typically kill undead gregor and that he needs to burn sandors greatest fear embracing gregor the hound falls into the flames immolating both of them
asoiaf,not_removed,hype is back on the menu
asoiaf,not_removed,and who can arm sandor with a fire weapon thoros of myr a founding member of the brotherhood without banners o maybe this is what the show is setting up
asoiaf,not_removed,a quick side note since you brought it up do people expect the trial by combat to happen the whole trial banned cersei goes on rampage tommen blames and kills himself plot seemed to me like it was one of the bigger picture outlines they got from gurm
asoiaf,not_removed,let the hype flow through you
asoiaf,not_removed,he has truly become one with the hype
asoiaf,not_removed,so he was only mostly dead
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree with most other readers who believe that gregor clegane died otherwise thered be hardly any reason for qyburns charade of introducing this mystery knight named robert strong about as subtle as a mace to the face qyburn anyway lets look at the facts things robert strong does not do eat talk use the privy drinkanything and keep in mind how heavy his armor is not act like hes reanimated so you see its clear that gregor clegane did perish but robert strong rises harder and stronger ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ
asoiaf,not_removed,but he doesnt have a head
asoiaf,not_removed,i think qyburn kept him alive by a thread did some freaky psuedoscience magic shit on him and now he serves shit magic is stronger than blood magic i guess
asoiaf,not_removed,what of the skull sent to dorne
asoiaf,not_removed,only for the hound to emerge unburnt sandor ahai
asoiaf,not_removed,we can only hope
asoiaf,not_removed,given what happened on the show i dont expect it to happen but theres enough of a chance that it could happen
asoiaf,not_removed,and also with you id like to note that the brotherhood without banners was originally and unintentionally formed as a party to bring gregor clegane to justice for his war crimes and atrocities for gregor it was just business as usual and cousin business wasaboomin
asoiaf,not_removed,ours is the hype
asoiaf,not_removed,so hes slightly alive
asoiaf,not_removed,what is hype may never die
asoiaf,not_removed,otherwise thered be hardly any reason for qyburns charade of introducing this mystery knight named robert strong well they have to act like hes dead since dorne wanted his skull even if he never died theyd have to fake his death or give him up or piss off the dornish
asoiaf,not_removed,i think he doesnt have a head but there are a few theories on some sort of head that he has robb starks decapitated head a dwarf head from those tyrion hunters or has joffreys head on my first read through i thought the crown sent an actual old giant skull down there to trick them but im pretty sure he has no head now
asoiaf,not_removed,one of the dwarf skulls that were presented to cersei one was described as having an uncommonly gigantic head
asoiaf,not_removed,get the chocolate
asoiaf,not_removed,as much as i detest the pseudointellectual charade that preston jacobs has been putting on during his season shit on the showrunners weekly videos i do find some potential truth to be found in his deeper dorne video series wherein he posits that too many coincidences and textual evidence place qyburn oberyn and dorne in general all in league with each other meaning qyburn as far as book canon goes is dorans man check out the deeper dorne series and see what you make of it i want to reiterate the fact that i do not share hardly any of jacobs animosity or personal disdain for the hbo adaptationseries he is merely making a fool of himself imo with those shenanigans
asoiaf,not_removed,it was probably the oversized dwarfs head qyburn specifically requests to keep it and they probably sent that skull to dorne it would be strange to send his actual skull then attach another thats an extra unnecessary step
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe im remembering wrong but when i read i specifically recall cersei saying they sent ser gregors head to dorne right before they bring in the dwarf i remember thinking why do people keep saying this when it says right here its not possible again could be remembering that totally wrong though
asoiaf,not_removed,the thing that makes it overly complicated is they got a skull and not a decaying head why would they do that unless they were trying to hide it not being gregors decomposing head
asoiaf,not_removed,while qyburn says i have your grace i am sorry that it took so long such a large head it took the beetles many hours to clean the flesh by way of pardon i have lined a box of ebony and silver with felt to make a fitting presentation for the skull pycelle mentioned that the flesh mortifies and the wounds ooze pus even maggots will not touch such foulness his convulsions are so violent that i have had to gag him to prevent him from biting off his own tongue i have cut away as much tissue as i dare and treated the rot with boiling wine and bread mold to no avail the veins in his arms are turning black when i leeched him all the leeches died maggots wouldnt touch him and leaches die but beetles can still do their thing a little suspicious
asoiaf,not_removed,they might be i just dont think its that dwarfs
asoiaf,not_removed,i just think its more of a leap to assume there was some head swapping then simple deceit on qyburn and cerseis part surprised more people dont feel that way
asoiaf,not_removed,id imagine having dragons helps not to mention surviving a funeral pyre unscathed she has slowly become a god like figure that many follow out of both fear and respect
asoiaf,not_removed,brown ben plumm anyone
asoiaf,not_removed,so you want to know why no one betrays her yet say three betrayals dont count dany cant have a lot of her people betray her because she doesnt really have any people she is young as shit and just gaining power all of her followers are jorah mirri or xaro types however if that isnt a good enough answer then because she is the last refuge of those who cant find a place in the current westeros or arent satisfied with their position in essos a lot of her top people have nowhere to go if they left her besides ben plum and daario though even daario now has a reputation so really once you turn to dany you are between a rock and a hard place oh that and her volatility and pet dragons dont help encourage quitters either
asoiaf,not_removed,xaro never betrayed her he was quite transparent that the alliance was out of convenience but she was betrayed by brown ben plumm who her dragons liked
asoiaf,not_removed,how can daenerys be betrayed by her people when very few of her entourage are truly hers by choice she only has the extremely weak from drogos khalasar jorah whos not even hers to begin with and this is basically all the only people who truly could betray her are her bloodriders but why would they do it she has dragons shes famous she offers them a decent life and she promises them fire and blood we can only talk about brown ben plumm at this degree
asoiaf,not_removed,since ben brown plumm is already a mercenary works for who pays him more is no surprise seeing him turning the cloak what apparently will occur again tyrion trying to join the second sons to dany again
asoiaf,not_removed,its not like theyre going to get new material to work with what other choice do they have
asoiaf,not_removed,season should just be renamed throwback thursday what with benjen and hodor and the hound and etc
asoiaf,not_removed,title contains dd people downvote i completely disagree with the sentiment but there is not much i can do
asoiaf,not_removed,why so much hate
asoiaf,not_removed,no hate just being a smart ass that being said martin is months away from having this entire goddamn show air in the time it takes him to write a single book i think im allowed to crack on him a little
asoiaf,not_removed,okay ill give you that
asoiaf,not_removed,spez i should point out that is on sale right now on steam and in addition to being the lead dev of the mod is very active in the sub
asoiaf,not_removed,most played game i have on steam in the momentalso the subreddit can be loads of fun
asoiaf,not_removed,great mod and reddit sub is very useful
asoiaf,not_removed,i should point out that a new update came out and you have to reset to the previous version of the base game if you have the current mod
asoiaf,not_removed,that mod was what got me into years back very good game im a few dlcs behind right now though i got burned out on it after a ludicrous amount of hours enjoyed
asoiaf,not_removed,i definitely recommend this mod for its great for role playing characters in the asoiaf universe you can play out aegons conquest the blackfyre rebellion and the war of the five kings its very detailed in how many characters have traits quite close to the book description
asoiaf,not_removed,youve helped me with an issue i had on i remembered your username because it thought it was fitting in that situation edit damn it i am wrong weve had sort of a misunderstanding over a comment in which you said muhammed would be proud of pedophile daemon blackfyre not a great conversation lmao
asoiaf,not_removed,aisha
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe a map i have a map of westeros and essos on my wall next to maps of middle earth and skyrim i have post it notes bearing the names of many of the principal characters that i move around the map as i read so i can see where everyone is in relation to everyone else or were you looking for something more artsy
asoiaf,not_removed,not with a no spoiler tag
asoiaf,not_removed,check this out bro its dope httpmimgurcomisnahzi
asoiaf,not_removed,i would love a minimalesque poster of dunkbriennes sheild design preferably a little grungyscratched up looking
asoiaf,not_removed,something ive done before is contact fan artists whose work i like and ask if i can have a print of their piece deviantart has a built in option for this but otherwise people have put things on redbubble for me redbubble already has a bunch actually maybe youd like one of httpswwwredbubblecomshopasoiafposters
asoiaf,not_removed,im going to start doing that as i read great idea
asoiaf,not_removed,there is a journeys map in the lands of ice and fire maps you might be interested in checking out
asoiaf,not_removed,ned stark and cersei lannister just to see what the hell that would be
asoiaf,not_removed,yup they would be httpimgurcomtcqgqde
asoiaf,not_removed,patchface and moonboy davos and stannis robb and littlefinger dolorous edd and tyrion val and taena barristan and arthur dayne daario benjen euron
asoiaf,not_removed,petyr baelish and podrick payne his name is pepod
asoiaf,not_removed,nice try dd we see through your attempt to figure out more shortcuts to wrap the hbo series up
asoiaf,not_removed,jaquen and littlefinger i shudder at the thought arya and the mountain tyrion and jon ned and arthur dayne lyanna stark and cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,jorah and joncon
asoiaf,not_removed,i would make bran and hodor one they would then be known as ser brandor the unbroken
asoiaf,not_removed,renly and stannis would be a charismatic and just king ramsay and joffrey as the king the horror they would flay pregnant cats ned and arthur day be the most honourable man that ever lived tyrion and daenerys the dwarf that is a dragon rider
asoiaf,not_removed,margaery and arya political savvy also unstoppable murdery facechanging skills old nan and dolorous edd old weird legends that always have a hilariously dismal outcome
asoiaf,not_removed,orson lannister and wun wun
asoiaf,not_removed,arianne and sansa the seductress and the maiden would be an interesting combination
asoiaf,not_removed,randyll tarly and stannis baratheon ser duncan the tall and gregor clegane tyrion lannister and wyman manderly
asoiaf,not_removed,daario and euron
asoiaf,not_removed,wun wun leaf bran bloodraven pyat pree melisandre giant magical monstrosity
asoiaf,not_removed,i would combine drogon and ser pounce a firebreathing flying cat
asoiaf,not_removed,that would be someone suffering from dissociative identity disorder and it wouldnt be pretty as one of the personas would be a brutal murderer now that i think about combining ned and cersei into one person could so quite the interesting mysterythriller story
asoiaf,not_removed,combining opposite characters would be so funny
asoiaf,not_removed,this image is physically hurting me
asoiaf,not_removed,unshtoppable
asoiaf,not_removed,the last one doesnt work you have to combine different people
asoiaf,not_removed,and combine benjen ant the waif however i believe they said different characters
asoiaf,not_removed,who brought this thing about benjen euron and daario being the same people
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm
asoiaf,not_removed,its canon duh
asoiaf,not_removed,theyve also been in some shit with wildfire jaime saved kings landing from wildfire tyrion saved kings landing with wildfire and cersei burned kings landing with wildfire
asoiaf,not_removed,shame
asoiaf,not_removed,indirectly responsible for tommen surely shed be directly responsible if she pushed him
asoiaf,not_removed,they also all killed kings hand jaime pyromancer tyrion tywin cersei kevan
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime strangled his cousin in season who was this i somehow cant remember
asoiaf,not_removed,both jaime and cersei are kingslayers if you count tommen
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei didnt kill tommen tommen made a choice
asoiaf,not_removed,except cersei is indirectly responsible for the death of tommen youre right that shes a kinslayer but not for this reason
asoiaf,not_removed,indirectly responsible for tommens tumble
asoiaf,not_removed,the show has quietly ignored the taboo against kinslaying probably because they had jaime casually murder his cousin to try and escape jail which i still have absolutely no idea why that would even work to be perfectly honest oh no the kingslayer is murdering another lannisteroh wait i hate the lannisters and the other prisoner is worthless as a hostage so who cares cersei killing family members doesnt seem out of character even though its varys who kills kevan in adwd but then you have euron openly confesses to it and not being immediately killed on the spot
asoiaf,not_removed,cerise is not directly responsible for tommens death tommen is responsible for his own death
asoiaf,not_removed,directly responsible for tommens tumble indirectly she didnt push tommen he made that freewill choice on his own based on her actions
asoiaf,not_removed,does a husband count as kin because cersei did that one too
asoiaf,not_removed,kinslaying doesnt mean anything in the show though literally no one bats an eye when you openly kill a family member for power
asoiaf,not_removed,uncle kevin sept alone
asoiaf,not_removed,which cousin did jamie strangle
asoiaf,not_removed,were just waiting for cersei to burn people in the book so its happening there too
asoiaf,not_removed,wildfire and blood
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime did not strangle him he bashed his head into a pulp with his chains
asoiaf,not_removed,tommens tumble love it
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei did more kinslaying than that she killed her daughterinlaw and a bunch of her family members i dont think its only the blood that counts since karstark accused robb of kinslaying before dying and the hooded man accused theon nevermind the theon durden and the the millers kids were really is kids theories cersei is also a kingslayer and queenslayer
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime didnt strangle his cousin in season he beat his cousin to death and then strangled the guardjailer who came to investigate
asoiaf,not_removed,i was wondering about kevan but now i realize that he was actually in the sept as well i dont know this becomes a little too convenient for my taste
asoiaf,not_removed,tumbling tommen
asoiaf,not_removed,tommens tumble it was more of a swan dive
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion also killed joanna
asoiaf,not_removed,i would put cerseis involvement with roberts killing above tommens seeing as it was intentional
asoiaf,not_removed,tommen dying wouldnt make cersei a kinslayer
asoiaf,not_removed,unless you believe s tyrion is not tywins son
asoiaf,not_removed,if tyrion ends up aerys bastard son then he would not be a kinslayer
asoiaf,not_removed,i think tyrion isnt tywins son as his mother was tywins cousin tyrion at least also killed his cousin
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion also killed his mother unintentionally of course
asoiaf,not_removed,two of them are dishonored and shamed and one became the queen of westeros guess which only happened in the show
asoiaf,not_removed,all three are kingslayers well suspected ones anyways jaimie kills aerys yet that death was deserved because it was either aerys or his father and the entire city of kings landing cersei kills robert by orchestrating a really stupid and foolish plan that wouldnt work in a million years except that it did and robert got too drunk to defend against a boar few have tied her to roberts death however tyrion kills joffrey except hes accused of that murder because we know he didnt do it but most of the world suspects it is him anyways
asoiaf,not_removed,plus cersei and jamie are probably secret targaryens so both lannister boys killed their fathers
asoiaf,not_removed,only if tywin was tyrions father youre no son of mine
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess cersei would see her use of it as saving kings landing
asoiaf,not_removed,this is a legitimate parallel too often especially in this sub people get caught up in making something out of nothing i like this observation and think it shows a good deal of each persons true character
asoiaf,not_removed,but who will save wildfire from kings landing
asoiaf,not_removed,the siblings and what they did with wildfire is the clearest explanation of their personalities in the series imo
asoiaf,not_removed,well tywin was known for saying rain fire down on them but mostly its because wildfire is something hard to make and that only the rich and powerful have access to even the maesters who make it have to be extremely careful in its creation and its a very specific procedure as we are told after the dragons all died the targs held their power because of their ability to create wildfire it seems only natural that the ruling family lannisters would use it a good deal since it keeps them in power both tyrion and cersei used it to great effect to defeat their enemies
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre the new mad targarians
asoiaf,not_removed,huh
asoiaf,not_removed,🔔
asoiaf,not_removed,🍷
asoiaf,not_removed,yes she is directly responsible for the high sparrows et al deaths because she orchestrated and ordered the explosions but she is indirectly responsible for tommens death because it was entirely his decision albeit motivated by her actions
asoiaf,not_removed,indirectly responsible for his death but directly responsible for his suicide she knew he loved marg and yet she killed her in front of him
asoiaf,not_removed,some random cousin who was also captured by the robbs forces jaime strangled him to attempt an escape
asoiaf,not_removed,ser showonly of house lannister
asoiaf,not_removed,in show this was cleos frey in the books cleos is killed on the journey down to kl with brienne and jaime edit show was not cleos frey but instead a lannister cousin alton lannister
asoiaf,not_removed,the cousin jaime killed in season was alton lannister
asoiaf,not_removed,google tommen baratheon for some reason they look almost identical edit he was another lannister cousin not the one jamie killed
asoiaf,not_removed,or if you count robert
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont find cersei wholly responsible for tommen he killed himself its on him
asoiaf,not_removed,well shes a queenslayer she didnt kill tommen tommen took his own life so her relationship to his death is indirect
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion too if you count him legally being guilty of killing joffrey
asoiaf,not_removed,now all they have to do is violate guest right and theyll hit the trifecta
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime killed aerys cersei ordered robert killed tyrion was convicted of killing joffrey those wacky lannisters
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion was found guilty of regicide
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its the highlight of this post
asoiaf,not_removed,when you murder someones smokin hot way the hell outta his league wife inlaws cousin uncle and entire religion i think you can at least split the blame for a subsequent suicide
asoiaf,not_removed,the entire jaime plan is just silly when theres so many ways it couldve been done without that needless murder which is then ignored
asoiaf,not_removed,its unfair to put his mother on him
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think deaths in childbirth are generally attributed to the children for the purposes of the kinslayer reference if we went there then jon and dany are both also kinslayers
asoiaf,not_removed,seriously tommen might have fucked up a lot of the stuff he tried to do but he managed that dive elegantly
asoiaf,not_removed,part of me really wants this to be true having all heads of the dragon kill their mothers in child birth would somehow make sense to me
asoiaf,not_removed,if he isnt theyre still first cousins once removed
asoiaf,not_removed,tywin and joanna lannister were first cousins though even assuming that aerys is the real father tyrion and tywin are more closely related than say the starks and the karstarks
asoiaf,not_removed,the world book almost completely made this not likely
asoiaf,not_removed,thats tywin disowning him its not literal
asoiaf,not_removed,words are wind tywin cant change tyrions paternity
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre all still joanna lannisters kids and grew up effectively believing they were siblings
asoiaf,not_removed,he wasnt speaking literally he was just cursing tyrion one last time before he died
asoiaf,not_removed,nah she sees her use of it as saving herself and her family name somehow
asoiaf,not_removed,i think she was just saving the viewers from high sparrow room scenes
asoiaf,not_removed,i see her use of it as causing kings landingsplat
asoiaf,not_removed,for all we know cerseis actions prevented the faith militant from making kings landing a living hell i dont think she gives a shit about saving anyone but maybe she played her part in saving the world kinda like golum
asoiaf,not_removed,the important thing to remember is that it indicates all of them are the mad kings get rather than tywins
asoiaf,not_removed,illuminati theme plays
asoiaf,not_removed,what the fucks a lommy
asoiaf,not_removed,shame
asoiaf,not_removed,everyone always gets it wrong its shame and then ding ding
asoiaf,not_removed,🗻
asoiaf,not_removed,op is literally misusing the word directly
asoiaf,not_removed,you say loved there is no real evidence beyond a teen boy liking sex
asoiaf,not_removed,but this always bothered me about jaime in the show he always struck me as fully dedicated to his family and the idea that he would kill a member of his family even distant just to escape seems way out of character in the same way im bothered that cersei incinerates kevan i know hes a thorn in her side but that act would be devastating for the power of the lannister house ah well
asoiaf,not_removed,was it cleos or was he just not in the show
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty sure it was a lannister cousin in the show there was no cleos frey
asoiaf,not_removed,not that cousin the cousin jamie killed was a different one the tommen one was killed by lord karstark
asoiaf,not_removed,uuuh what
asoiaf,not_removed,that is about lannisters who were killed by carstark
asoiaf,not_removed,link
asoiaf,not_removed,robert
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree somewhat but he wouldnt have killed himself if cersei didnt blow up the sept
asoiaf,not_removed,if anything shes indirectly responsible for tommens death
asoiaf,not_removed,in the behind the episode for the finale dd said if cersei was with tommen he wouldnt have commit suicide that feeling of loneliness played a huge role in his decision
asoiaf,not_removed,its on the ground outside his window
asoiaf,not_removed,shes a kinslayer she killed her own uncle and cousin lancel
asoiaf,not_removed,but he wasnt involved at all you cant count him legally being guilty
asoiaf,not_removed,tywin conspired to have king robb in the north killed and allowed cersei to try to execute tyrion
asoiaf,not_removed,when youre the king youre the top league and tommo wasnt ugly
asoiaf,not_removed,she wasnt way out of his league he was just younger had he grown to adulthood he probably would have been a handsome and desirable man since he was king
asoiaf,not_removed,its still reaching cersei is a kinslayer but not for the death of tommen
asoiaf,not_removed,the lannister twins have never been known for their logical wellthought out plans more of a lets see if murdering somebody fixes this problem approach to life
asoiaf,not_removed,his mother was not the fat lannister if she was he would have known jamie also didnt strangle his cousin he beat his head in with his chains he strangled the karstark boy
asoiaf,not_removed,huh no memory of that i gotta rewatch that shit btw why did he strangle him
asoiaf,not_removed,that was cleos frey from the books and jaime didnt kill him he was just really cold about his death the cousin who was murdered by jaime in the show was called alton lannister
asoiaf,not_removed,tywin also cant make tyrion not the son of aerys ii targaryen
asoiaf,not_removed,true enough but we know that blood has power in this world if there is anything to the curse of the kinslayer it may not affect those who murder nonblood relatives ie adoptive fathers
asoiaf,not_removed,i know that many people dont want another secret targaryen and that some people argue unconvincingly i think that the tywintyrion relationship is less interesting if theyre not bloodrelated but as theories go is one of the better supported it may be disappointing to some but it aint crazy
asoiaf,not_removed,which should be baratheon that confused me
asoiaf,not_removed,youre absolutely right but politically speaking shed spin that shit
asoiaf,not_removed,awww i loved those
asoiaf,not_removed,dude those scenes were great granted they took up lots of time but they were great
asoiaf,not_removed,🔔
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but getting a reddit thread to do that is like when youre at a concert and the band leader tries to get everyone to do a clap thats more complex than a beat
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt it
asoiaf,not_removed,💀
asoiaf,not_removed,figuratively
asoiaf,not_removed,is that not the purest form of love
asoiaf,not_removed,kevan had turned against her and stripped her of power at every turn he wasnt with her so he was against her
asoiaf,not_removed,but jaime was all about the things i do for love if killing a distant cousin gets him the freedom to go back to the woman he loves that cousin is toast
asoiaf,not_removed,i imagine its just because the show has to expedite things and try to stick with major themes but due to how they do it different people end up doing it like with how varys killed pycelle and kevan to hamstring the realm by having cersei lead it instead we have cersei remove all wise counsel herself and claim the throne it still shows cerseis pride and ineptitude but it doesnt show the political intrigue with varys directing things
asoiaf,not_removed,show jaime is dedicated to his immediate family he isnt really shown giving too much of a shit about distant cousins remember the scene with tywin over tyrions trial who will take on the family name lancel lannister some others whose names i do not even remember the cousin he killed in season was so distant and of such low importance that he didnt even recognize him at first it took the cousin retelling the story of how theyd met to spark any memories knowing him
asoiaf,not_removed,all jaime and cersei give a shit about are each other and the extensions of themselves their kids it makes perfect sense that they would go to any lengths to keep each other safeget back to each other
asoiaf,not_removed,i honestly dont remember if he had a name in the show and i remembered he was bludgeoned to death not choked out
asoiaf,not_removed,you are right it was a alton lannister apparently squires with jaime at some previous time and ends up with a broken skull as jaime uses him in his failed attempted escape
asoiaf,not_removed,cleos frey was a frey with a lannister mother who was raised in the westerlands and fought with the lannister army at the whispering wood
asoiaf,not_removed,jamie says something about the cousins mother being the fat one referring to genna lannister cleos mother in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,fun fact the lannister boy killed by lord karstark and tommen are played by the same actor making him the only actor to die twice on got
asoiaf,not_removed,the actor who played tommen was previously killed as a lannister cousin in stark captivity by the karstark who wanted revenge for his familys blood being shed
asoiaf,not_removed,show only
asoiaf,not_removed,not the scene mentioned but heres the character in
asoiaf,not_removed,hands of the king are not kings though tyrion do have this one in common with cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,twas the lion ripped off his balls and the boar did the rest
asoiaf,not_removed,sure but by that logic catelyn wouldnt have been murdered if robb hadnt betrayed his alliances does that make robb a kinslayer
asoiaf,not_removed,thats still not directly responsible if she shoved him out the window thats on her but creating an event that causes him so much anguish and grief that he jumps out himself thats indirect
asoiaf,not_removed,definitely true although i bet if you ask anyone whose still kickin in kl they would probably believe she killed him
asoiaf,not_removed,indirectly thats all
asoiaf,not_removed,indirectly being responsible for someones death isnt the same thing as outright killing them
asoiaf,not_removed,he was found guilty
asoiaf,not_removed,beta af though and serious mommy issues
asoiaf,not_removed,in the books even sansa seems to think tommen would make a good husband from acok they were helping prince tommen mount his pony if only tommen were the elder instead of joffrey sansa thought i wouldnt mind marrying tommen
asoiaf,not_removed,cersie sure but jaime aerys and his pyro posse were rightos kills jory and neds men were specifically to put the fear of god into him and get tyrion released which very well could have worked if tyrion hadnt got himself out who else is there i feel just killing his cousin for shits and giggles was way out of character
asoiaf,not_removed,he strangled him to escape from jail he uses his death as a bait to unlock the door and kill also the guard and flee away
asoiaf,not_removed,he was locked up by kat he used the guy as a distraction and attempted to escape
asoiaf,not_removed,which he isnt the only proof for that theory is one line from agot about how bright his hair shines
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime and cersei being secret targs makes way more sense though it makes jaime not only a kingslayer but a kinslayer as well and it means that robert baratheon who hated targaryens and wanted to destroy every remnant of the line was actually fathering three furthermore it makes cerseis desire to be her fathers daughter more ironic because even though shes trying to emulate tywin shes actually acting more in line with aeryss behavior it also means that tywins only child was tyrion which makes tyrions relationship and ultimate murder of him even more tragic finally having two of the main characters jon and tyrion both be secret targs feels redundant and contrived tyrion being secretly a targaryen doesnt make any thematic sense because of the fact that one of tyrions primary motivations is wanting tywin to acknowledge him as his rightful successor and if thats resolved by saying lol doesnt matter hes not a lannister anyway that entire theme feels a bit flat
asoiaf,not_removed,she doesnt have the last name baratheon i think i read on here somewhere that you cant marry into the royal name which is why her and margery still have their born names
asoiaf,not_removed,nope elia was never called elia targaryen
asoiaf,not_removed,shame
asoiaf,not_removed,its particularly awkward because sound travels slowly and the people in the back try to be visually in sync with the people near the stage
asoiaf,not_removed,our local hockey team had dream theater in the intro tape yeah that went exactly as well as youd think
asoiaf,not_removed,👽🚬🗿
asoiaf,not_removed,thats true but part of what makes the lannisters the lannisters is that theyre devoted to their family to an almost absurd degree this is partially what makes the tyrion saga so compelling because tywins hatred of tyrion starts to break down this overriding motive culminating in tyrions murder of tywin that is rightfully shocking but cerseis murder of kevan seems like an afterthought jaimes murder of his cousin just jaime being naughty ol jaime kinslaying seems like just the normal run of events in the show lannister house and if jaime does end up killing cersei it will be yet another example which weakens it
asoiaf,not_removed,showkevan also let the high sparrow gain influence over the king while he held the queen and her brother hostage he was competent in the books but in the show he was more incompetent then mace
asoiaf,not_removed,but bran isnt a lannister
asoiaf,not_removed,yes varys killing kevan makes perfect sense edit and as i mention somewhere else her killing kevan is ok as long as there are some kind of consequences for it
asoiaf,not_removed,im not sure he had a choice in becoming kingsguard but he probably thought it was nice for those reasons
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime asks if altons mother is the fat one and gets a confused response then says nevermind because if his mom was the fat one alton would know it alton is more distantly related to jaime than cleos frey is
asoiaf,not_removed,lol i didnt think about it although beric dondarrion has been killed like times or something but only once on screen i believe so tommen did die twice xd
asoiaf,not_removed,i know but that is entirely irrelevant to the guy jaime killed
asoiaf,not_removed,tell me which do you favor your fingers or your tongue
asoiaf,not_removed,indirectly yes
asoiaf,not_removed,i wonder what the public story for that is going to be does she say she did it try and stop her or does she blame it on her usual scapegoat who is conveniently on his way back to westeros and also previously used wildfire
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah just in case theres any confusion im agreeing with you and disagreeing with the op
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed unless she said jump out the window or i burn the city his death isnt on her hands conscience probably if she had one
asoiaf,not_removed,she left him alone so she could go torture the nun shes as responsible as you can get
asoiaf,not_removed,is it legal if he didnt do it
asoiaf,not_removed,are you talking about yourself or game of thrones im confused
asoiaf,not_removed,ya i was mostly paraphrasing what jamie said there
asoiaf,not_removed,you know i kinda recall that now still gotta rewatch tho
asoiaf,not_removed,twas a joke
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought it was that widows lose any house name they inherit through marriage hence why the queen of thorns is technically called olenna redwyne in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,but in season episode lyanna mormont calls sansa a bolton
asoiaf,not_removed,lady stark catelyn confused
asoiaf,not_removed,catelyn stark
asoiaf,not_removed,🔔
asoiaf,not_removed,ayy lmao
asoiaf,not_removed,tywin is the one that put family above everything hes constantly trying to preach it to the others jaime and cersei never appear to have that same thought on it at least not to extended family
asoiaf,not_removed,tywin was minimizing tyrions influence and political power for two seasons before tyrion killed him same with cersei and kevan to me the only one that seems out of place for such an outwardly devoted family is jaime murdering his cousin to possibly escape but he was a conceited jackass
asoiaf,not_removed,kevan getting killed was also a you cant make an omelette without breaking a few eggs she already took steps to keep tommen out of it she couldnt have done the same with kevan she couldnt have saved him if she wanted to i doubt she would think well i will go to my trial because there is no way i can save myself without also killing that uncle who took actions to see me in this mess tommen was a kid i am pretty sure outlawing trial by combat was in part kevans idea tommen most likely took no decision without consulting the hand of the king
asoiaf,not_removed,i didnt mean bran was jaime killed his cousin to get back to cersei it was one of the things he did for lovecersei family is important to jaime but a distant family member vs getting back to his sister ends up making jaime a kinslayer the things i do for cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,beric died so hard the first time he returned looking like a completely different person
asoiaf,not_removed,yea on screen i meant
asoiaf,not_removed,he confused both cousins as being the same one
asoiaf,not_removed,nods approvingly
asoiaf,not_removed,the great sept was poisoned by its enemies
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe having his corpse burned and the ashes buried among the ruins of the sept is her cover story all people who werent there would probably assume he was there
asoiaf,not_removed,anyone that cared enough about the trial would have been at the trial i bet most of the common folk have no idea whats going on all they know is there was an explosion at the sept qyburn ser gregor and cersei are basically the only people that would have been at the trial but werent and still survived i dont understand how the throne room is full of nobles at her coronation
asoiaf,not_removed,well you know they were all poisoned by our enemies so that is enough for the public
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty sure tommen is more responsible for tommens death than cersei is so you can get a lot more responsible than cersei is just sayin
asoiaf,not_removed,yes and innocent people are found guilty in trial and are in jail often enough its estimated to be about a rate
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i believe is legal even if he didnt do it unless he is found to be not guilty in by a higher court
asoiaf,not_removed,good thing for sansa because being lannisterboltonstark is quite a mouthful
asoiaf,not_removed,are you sure wasnt lysa arryn and not tully
asoiaf,not_removed,shes not in the royal family ned wasnt a king
asoiaf,not_removed,how does it feel to get the same answer in a row
asoiaf,not_removed,the starks werent royalty when she married into them
asoiaf,not_removed,the rule only applies to the royal house every other noble family can marry into another ie catelyn taking on the stark name by marrying ned part of it is to ensure that the royal family remains distinct and lines of succession made fairly clear cersei isnt claiming the throne for house baratheon house baratheon at this point is dead even if you consider cerseis children as baratheons cersei remains a member of house lannister claiming the throne through a mixture of her connection to it wife and mother of the last three kings but mostly the fact that she commands the biggest force in kings landing at the moment the lannister army
asoiaf,not_removed,elia martell
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre not royalty
asoiaf,not_removed,shame
asoiaf,not_removed,🐸
asoiaf,not_removed,tywin didnt really care about family that was the underlying theme he cared about his legacy this show is about the greyness the depth complication and the ramifications of our ideologies and decisions tywin was selfmotivated while maybe he did care for jaime and cersei in some paternal way he was motivated by his need to live beyond his death the great legacy of tywin lannister is what motivated him above all else led him to his own demise
asoiaf,not_removed,i still feel like what tywin did to tyrion is way worse than anything kevan did to cersei kevan worked against her but do i have to list the horrible things tywin did to tyrion before he finally snapped and unlike cersei tyrion didnt deserve it still the cersei murdering kevan thing can still work if the show has some practical consequences from it but thats where i have my doubts characters get killed and the reaction or consequences seem to be zilch does jaime react to the murder of kevan does tyrion i want a story from it but im afraid that it will be glossed over like jaime murdering his cousin nothing to do but wait and see
asoiaf,not_removed,what i got was after the failure of the show of force against the high sparrow at the steps of the sept i think kevan was hoping that the only way out of the mess was to go through it just like margaery was playing he probably counseled tommen to keep working with the high sparrow after all he wanted to keep lansel alive and well as long as he could too
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe but grrm doesnt have jaime do that and jaime in almost all interactions with his family is very fair even when he speaks with lancel and gets a definitive answer that he was sleeping with cersei he doesnt kill lancel or otherwise try to hurt him but instead encourages him to act as a responsible member of house lannister the threat bran posed to cersei was totally different brans knowledge would have meant war and potentially the deaths of himself cersei and all their children and perhaps the destruction of house lannister contrast that with a weak attempt to escape a pow camp and it just doesnt seem as dramatically logical i mean robb stark beheaded his ally lord karstark for killing two lannisters but jaime kills a lannister and no one bats an eye did anyone ever mention it again in show
asoiaf,not_removed,heh her royal heinous
asoiaf,not_removed,i meant more for the whole sept but i can see where my phrasing was confusing i dont even think she needs a cover story for tommen the king was overcome by the grief of his wife his brother and father by law and his friend and close confidant the high sparrow
asoiaf,not_removed,i bet the same on the common folk but they will still likely want to know why mummers will want a tale to tell which is why i suspect cersei publically blaming it on tyrion or trying to kings landing is huge and while the sept was full it was full of more than just nobles there were also sparrows i think those in the sept were either related or closely involved in the trials and the richernosier nobles that came to bare witness the throne room after would be full of brotherssons that just became lords lesser lords that have a chance at landsriches and those that just dont want to start out on the bad side of the mad queen have you seen the thing that follows her around
asoiaf,not_removed,a lot of people probably lost someone in that blast it wasnt just limited to who was in the sept it took out a good portion of the city around it the tension in the throne room as cersei took her crown was palpable theres a reason she had the room lined with guardsmen shouldertoshoulder they know something is up whether she says so or not
asoiaf,not_removed,its pretty hard for them to not know there was an explosion at the sept
asoiaf,not_removed,is there a reason olenna wasnt there other than to have her survive and seek vengeance youd think shed have front row seats
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed if hes lonely why didnt he just use the stairs to go out and be with people i mean i guess the window is faster
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean you arent wrong cersei wouldnt be convicted of murder for this in any court but she may lose a wrongful death type of suit
asoiaf,not_removed,bring back trial by combat
asoiaf,not_removed,who was found guilty by men trial by law and by the gods trial by battle theres no hope for tyrion unless another monarch issues a pardon and is strong enough to force his will on others
asoiaf,not_removed,im sure littlefinger would be happy with sansa having a mouthful
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but the arryns werent nobility right kind of like how its catelyn stark instead of tully i think it only applies if you marry into the royal family
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry far as we know is still alive
asoiaf,not_removed,🔔
asoiaf,not_removed,oh shit waddup
asoiaf,not_removed,shh bby is ok
asoiaf,not_removed,great point
asoiaf,not_removed,i sincerely hope that there are massive consequences for cersei i hope no midlevel lord and lady just shrugging the destruction of the sept off and cozying up to her she would get new lickspittles from among the lesser nobility but anyone with any brains would see that she is too volitile to trust for longer than a minute
asoiaf,not_removed,does tyrion hopefully considering kevan was his favorite after jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,but im afraid that it will be glossed over like jaime murdering his cousin jaime did express regret over this he tells cersei that he murdered someone to get back to her
asoiaf,not_removed,even when he speaks with lancel and gets a definitive answer that he was sleeping with cersei he doesnt kill lancel this was after meeting brienne and after losing his hand he was humbled his character was different kill a member of his family even distant just to escape seems way out of character this was totally incharacter for old jaime i think you are trying to apply new jaimes morals to make sense of old jaimes actions of course it does not make sense he changed so much after and acok
asoiaf,not_removed,fair enough the sept isnt that big so i guess it stands to reason there would be enough people that didnt go that could probably work out cersei was behind it
asoiaf,not_removed,marg told her to go to hg
asoiaf,not_removed,margery told her to gtfo weeks ago
asoiaf,not_removed,well she also murdered a lot of people so i think they probably would focus on those charges
asoiaf,not_removed,see tommen is indirectly responsible for blowing up the sept by outlawing trial by combat edit a word
asoiaf,not_removed,gee i wonder who that would be
asoiaf,not_removed,well they dont call him littlewang
asoiaf,not_removed,its semantics but all highborn individuals are nobility i believe the point youre making would refer to royalty arryns starks tullys martells etc are all noble houses targaryens and later baratheons are the royal houses
asoiaf,not_removed,i was responding to about widows losing their house name i dont think lysa was called lysa tully after jon arryn was killed i might be wrong though
asoiaf,not_removed,i think catelyn referred to herself as tully while they were in the riverlands to remind the riverlords that she was a tully and that robb had tully blood
asoiaf,not_removed,she is not next in line some distant relative of baratheonsor targaryen would be next in line legally speaking but anyone who can show their claim through either of those with big enough army has best claim ie danny
asoiaf,not_removed,gendrys an unacknowledged bastard unless robert got doublemarried
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry is an unrecognized bastard with no claim to the baratheon name even if he did come forward no one is going to believe that he is roberts son and even if they did no one is going to accept him as the legitimate heir to roberts throne again house baratheon is dead
asoiaf,not_removed,doesnt take much though
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought gerion was tyrions favourite uncle
asoiaf,not_removed,i think you are trying to apply new jaimes morals to make sense of old jaimes actions no thats not quite it but i dont think i could quite frame it before without having all this back and forth with people here here it is i think show jaime and book jaime are two mostly different people there are several actions that show jaime does that book jaime either doesnt or wouldnt do examples his murder of his cousin his rape of cersei at tywins wake yes that looks like a rape to me and is quite different in tone than the book i dont give the show the benefit of the doubt here because they did the same with dany and drogo his persistence in loving cersei while book jaime starts moving away from her his openness about his relationship with cersei to people like edmure tully and framing that as the motivation for his threat to storm riverrun all of these things are things book jaime doesnt do and thats fine but the problem is that there are zero consequences from his actions he does these things and then next week its like nothing happened meanwhile we can see what consequences look like because all of grrms moments where jaime is a hot head have lasting consequences his throwing bran out the window his attack on ned these choices have severe and lasting dramatic consequences but again if jaime killed a member of the lannister family then why did we never hear of it again what did his rape of cersei tell us about his character what did it do to their relationship seemingly nothing since he seemed to be in the middle of his redemption arc and the rape was this weird one time event type thing why would he tell anyone about his relationship to cersei book jaime wont even tell lancel who also slept with cersei so what dramatic consequences arise from jaime telling someone who continues to be a lord and continues to live asoiaf is about consequences of actions and just dropping this stuff does a disservice to the characters
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i just dont think anyone will be able to prove it short of getting a confession out of qyburna little bird but a think a few people will be able to piece together huh the one person who was supposed to be at the sept wasnt and now everyone is dead up her when we all pretty much know the trial wasnt going to go in her favor
asoiaf,not_removed,fuck me that was obvious cheers
asoiaf,not_removed,the night king
asoiaf,not_removed,except they do littlefinger is actually a dick joke at his expense
asoiaf,not_removed,its like a babys pinky
asoiaf,not_removed,actually the martells are a royal house as far as i can tell their title is prince of dorne rather than lord of x and the members of that family alone other than the royal family in kings landing get called prince and princess
asoiaf,not_removed,next in line would probably some valaryon
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei is the next in line im afraid its a little complicated and goes very far back but she is the next in line so the royal line is baratheon but with him and all his sons dead we have to go back to roberts greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather arion to find anyone who married into a line which still survives corwen baratheon married a woman named leyne and had six kids one of them arion was roberts greatgreatgreat grandfather the next one down to have surviving kids was elyanna who married a lord named mathin lord mathin lannister from there we can all see where it is going the line descends all the way to you guessed it cersei lannister tyrion is banished as a traitor to the throne and jaimes kingsguard oath somewhat prevents him from being in the line of succession even though tommen removed him from it now before you scream targaryen into my ear im afraid that since robert seized power the targaryen dynasty is no longer the royal line its a little complicated but assuming that dynasties and royal lines works in the same way they did in medieval england since baratheon is now the royal line previous royal lines no longer count in the succession just because robert decided to be king because he was somewhat closely related to targaryens he was by no means the heir to the throne and his taking of it
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe her great great great great grandmother is a baratheon
asoiaf,not_removed,🔔
asoiaf,not_removed,presumably the other poster was talking about living relatives gerions been dead for years
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree show jamie is baffling his latest inconsistency is he says in his speech to edmure tully how much he admires cersei because she would burn cities to the ground for her children but then he seems upset when he arrives back in kings landing to find out that is what cersei has done i know you could argue that cersei did it for herself not for tomman but the fact that she kept tomman in the red keep would indicate that she did mean for tomman to sit the throne even if he was going to be more or less her puppet in her eyes if tomman was going to be a puppet king it would be better for her to be pulling the strings rather than the hs or margaery
asoiaf,not_removed,thought it was in reference to his familys little holding on the fingers
asoiaf,not_removed,what kind of manipulative genius would have a pecker that small
asoiaf,not_removed,hes from the fingers the smallest one
asoiaf,not_removed,thats the more polite version for kids you have to read between the lines
asoiaf,not_removed,har
asoiaf,not_removed,he also lost part of his pinky when he fought brandon stark so there are three versions really
asoiaf,not_removed,charles dance was not a accurate tywin but he was magnificent
asoiaf,not_removed,lena headey
asoiaf,not_removed,this is not a no spoilers topic for when to use no spoilers i am removing this post if you repost with a different tag youll be good to go thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,there could be dragons near asshai but that land is so secretive and dangerous that no one knows for sure i believe in one of brans dreams he sees dragons stirring in asshai beneath the sunrise or something like that
asoiaf,not_removed,while i think it is a fair criticism to suggest that any other dragons would have been spotted and known to the noble class if not the general public especially if they have been around for many years it is worth noting that since danys dragons hatched only a comparatively small number of people in the world have seen them those who have not seen the dragons dismiss the notion out of hand tywin most notably this is even despite the fact that dany travels around with her dragons out in the open calling herself mother of dragons and basically creating as much havoc in the east as possible it seems to me that if someone had dragons and wanted to keep them hidden it would not be overly difficult to shut up about it and keep them in a remote location since the odd sighting here or there would also be quickly dismissed after all summer describes what some believe to be a dragon at the end of cok and most of this community dismisses that out of hand despite the fact that we are all aware of dragons existing elsewhere i am suspicious that dragons hatched at summerhall though i have no evidence since the whole situation is conveniently shrouded in mystery point is i dont think it would as difficult as some claim to hide dragons good question
asoiaf,not_removed,cannibal could be on skaagos
asoiaf,not_removed,could it be possible white walkers have ice dragons could they raise a dead dragon one of danys dragons dying and the others raising it from the dead holy fuck
asoiaf,not_removed,there was a thread yesterday theorizing how there may be dragon eggs in the crypts under winterfell hidden in lyannas tomb waiting for jon
asoiaf,not_removed,in regards to the ice dragon i think an ice vs fire dragon battle would be cool but to me it seems unlikely that ones just hiding under the wall or winterfell i know there are references to them as a separate species but given the whole theme of duality in the series fireice lightdark lifedeath revolving around the red god and the great other my guess is also that one of danys dragons will be killed in a battle with the others and resurrected as a wight undead dragon for their side im imagining a pretty awesome scene where the nights king places a hand on the dead dragon and we just see its eyes open and turn blue like crastors baby in the show then again maybe its just wishful thinking the others themselves might be the icy counterpart to the dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,summer describes what some believe to be a dragon at the end of cok wait whos summer what bit are you referring to specifically i like your point about people only really knowing of danys dragons because she has openly advertised them it could be possible the white walkers have ice dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,the smoke and ash clouded his eyes and in the sky he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame he bared his teeth but then the snake was gone bran vii acok this is in the very last chapter of cok where bran and gang are leaving winterfell after ramsay has it put to the torch bran is warging summer his direwolf as they walk away and the above passage is what is described through summers eyes however most readers it seems dismiss this the colorful way of describing things that the direwolves have they describe the chain holding the doors to the godswood shut as a great snake as well iirc i cannot say for sure if this dismissal is correctly attributed but it isnt without merit
asoiaf,not_removed,i see thank you for some reason i thought summer was sansas direwolf that got shanked i realise now that was lady thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,oh dont be too hard on yourself everyone is a little lady sometimes p
asoiaf,not_removed,oh lord im as useless as nipples on a breastplate
asoiaf,not_removed,for what its worth the red wedding was a shade worse because robb was betrayed by his own men and he definitely wasnt at war with them like he was with lannisters these men were obviously paid to do it by lannisters see all the rewards freys and boltons got from the crown for dareon to be the same hed have needed to die i dont know at some dinner in kings landing while being hosted by velaryons for example but yeah im more arguing semantics here and while on one side dornish were basically doing it in selfdefense remember that dareon invaded them and turned their country to ruin for no good reason and baelorco had the good reason peace finally to not punish the dornish its no surprise that it backfired with the various blackfyre rebellions and while i again think that blackfyres werent so simple lordly greed is the main motivation i see here same as in most wars the broken guest rightpeace banner in dorne wasnt a good precedent something lannisters should have thought of but then again its not like they pay attention to history exhibit a cersei faith militant
asoiaf,not_removed,i understand that reading about targaryen history mostly from their prospective while also following the deeds of of them in our current story can make us more sympathetic to their cause but im not sure daeron i was on the right side of history on this one although a brilliant and charming young man he was trying to invade the sovereign nation that had its own culture laws and political system and impose himself as their king all in the name of glory and vanity he failed and as a result got thousands of his countrymen killed emptied the coffers of the crown and forced the people he so badly wanted to govern into hiding in precarious conditions he didnt attempt peace with the dornish because he was just and magnanimous but because he lost the war and wasnt able to keep it going their treacherious murder of king daeron although not ethically irreproachable was in my opinion both born from despair and necessary as a warning to the iron throne not to fuck with the dornish without it the next generation of targaryens or the one after that wouldve launched anothe conquest of dorne campaign and i honnestly dont see how baelor trying to avenge daeron wouldve been beneficial for anyone in westeros including the targs i mean baelors otherworldy saintlike aproach is the only reason the iron throne was able to keep a diplomatic relationship with dorne which then allowed daeron ii to annex dorne through personal union in what was probably the best political move from a targaryen since aegon i what would daemons purge achieve for the exactly besides alienating their most recently acquired province and creating more division on the finally unified continent also i want to point out even though i see the paralel the assassination of daeron is very different from the red wedding in the eyes of the dornishmen daeron was a man who attacked their land with no reason killed their brothers humiliated their lords and forced them into hiding in the desert simply to survive and exist as a people and for that he was assassinated robb on the other hand didnt marry lord freys daughter and for that he was assassinated edit formating
asoiaf,not_removed,baelor knew he wasnt having children and that daeron ii will be on the iron throne someday by marrying daeron ii to the heir of dorne mariah martell was older than prince maron he likely viserys had a hand in it as wellguaranteed the union of the iron and dorne would happen thats not really a reward for dorne
asoiaf,not_removed,not to mention we dont really the details of what occurred either just because your enemy shows up with a rainbow flag doesnt mean youre not allowed to kill them its not like he really showed them much mercy when he invaded their lands in the first place theres no mention of them granting him guest right as far as i know im not saying the kid deserved to die he never should have been given the power to send a nation to war at that age but i wouldnt be so certain that he died too soon how many people died because he wanted to conquer dorne either way it was still a tragedy for both sides i guess
asoiaf,not_removed,daeron had defeated the dornish again and was trying to create a new peace dorne had been sanctioning raids against the stormlands and the reach for centuries so daeron was not without a cascus beli during the conquest the martels undoubtedly proved their untrustworthy nature by using poison arrows against the royal forces at sunspear as shown by the death of ser rickon stark heir to winterfell you are forgetting about the ramifications it isnt about sending a message it showed that a dornishmans word and more specifically a martels word meant nothing and that you can just say you want peace while secretly planning to murder them all the faith of the seven is based off the catholic church and thus murder and breaking a truce are considered grave sins baelor should been filled with righteous fury over daerons murder the peace with dorne was essentially the same as allowing china into the global world market under president clinton it seemed good but would eventually fuck us in the end it would simply drive out the martels and their allies from court and replace the weak targaryens with the powerful blackfyres the yronwoods could be appointed lords paramount after the rebellion which could sate some of the dornish and punish the martels daeron wasnt committing genocide against the dornish he was conquering them had dorne accepted their defeat in the conquest they would have been allowed into the kings peace and eventually enjoy the same rights as the rest of the seven kingdoms
asoiaf,not_removed,that is a reward for dorne as it meant that any future targeryan monarch would have dornish blood in them
asoiaf,not_removed,well from what we know dornish agreed to negotiate with dareon under the peace banner they killed him and everyone with him a stark was there too incidentally and since neither dornish nor the peacemaking targs ever protested that narrative even though itd have suited them for the sake of peace i take it as true and peacenegotiating banner especially after you agree to honor it its as bad as breaking breadandsalt guest right is here to protect travelers in countries without police force and no wonder the north sticks to it the most to deny guest right to someone during winter is basically murder as well as ensure various people politicians different religions merchants etc etc can sit together under one roof without mayhem peacenegotiating banner is similar then in that its a combination of dont shoot the messenger and well we gotta stop this war sometime and to do that we need to negotiate otherwise no two antagonistic factions can ever meet halfway so in short this was bad as to that whole war being an exercise in vanity and boykings being allowed to rule a mistake yeah im with you there
asoiaf,not_removed,when aegon returned the next morning he agreed to the peace and signed a treaty to that effect this is the difference aegon for whatever reason set aside vengeance and conquest and signed a peace daeron despite having a huge amount of men die in holding dorne daeron didnt even try and negotiate when dorne first rebelled he instead attempted to break the dornish forcefully and brutally no matter the cost no matter how many lives it took this is idiotic vain and stupid he didnt care how many men he had to kill or how many of his men had to die he would not let dorne be separate or even attempt to let them have a fair deal instead he brought war to their country to break them so yes they killed him ingloriously for their people for their kingdom for their freedom this was a man who had no care for lives or respect he only cared for his own glory he warred against the dornish and so they killed him was it wrong yes you know what else is wrong always choosing war and killing instead of anything else never stopping regardless of the lives lost never attempting a different path thats wrong daeron wasnt fighting the dornish for any other cause than glory daeron ii succeeded where daeron i had failed by showing respect to the dornish by letting them keep their customs and marrying into them he didnt need a sword to make dorne apart of the seven kingdoms and he also didnt need to sacrifice tens of thousands of lives to do so daemon wanted to undo this he was willing to go back to fighting and killing when they had a peace why because of hate and bad blood just like daeron i he was willing to sacrifice lives for something that wasnt at all necessary why should living men have to die to avenge a dead man why should living men die to conquer a place already peacefully apart of the seven kingdoms daeron i and daemon blackfyre only cared for war and killing and glory and they both died because of it
asoiaf,not_removed,the dornish are stubborn and to force them to surrender you must break then look at any number of countries in the real world that had to be broken before they surrendered again dorne had been raiding the reach and the stormlands for centuries and even continued raiding into the reign of the dragons dorne had to be brought to heel daeron would sacrifice tens of thousands of lives by creating the climate that fostered thr blackfyre rebellions in addition to sacrificing lives in new rebellions that he was responsible for starting he would sacrfice the honor justice and the integrity of the iron throne and house targaryen dorne was not peacefully apart of thr seven kingdoms they were actually constantly raiding the reach and the stormlands
asoiaf,not_removed,daeron the ii had no choice in the matter baelor made peace with dorne daeron ii would have had no way of getting justice unless he attacked them which would have served no point other than lets get revenge for a guy forty years dead daeron i didnt attack the dornish to bring them to heel he attacked them to complete what aegon did daeron i started the fight and the dornish finished it the blackfyre rebellions were the cause of people not liking daeron ii scholarly nature and looking for a warrior they chose daemon what fostered the blackfyre rebellions was people thinking they had a right to choose who was their king for no better reason then i dont like him and i dont like the dornish regardless of whether or not the dornish needed to be brought to heel they werent going to take it or let their country take it daeron was victim of that personally i dont like the dornish before aegon i took westeros i dont like how early on they acted like the iron islands raiding and then dipping back to where they could defend but peace was made and that meant putting aside the dead and the wars beyond count including daeron i and his dornish conquest
asoiaf,not_removed,completing aegons conquest would have brought the dornish to heel and stoped their rading the sand and sald dornish suck the only cool ones are the stone peace without justice is just submission to evil
asoiaf,not_removed,the only instance we hear of raiding in or around daerons time is the princess of dorne encouraging her men to raid into the dornish marches thats bad and upsetting but instead of trying to negotiate or make terms daeron invaded dorne and killed thousands that was his response when dorne was warring against aegon the dornish invaded the stormlands captured several castles burned huge parts of the rainwood and destroyed everything near the walls of oldtown nothing to this degree or even close was noted before daerons invasion therefore bringing war and battle to dorne when nothing of such significant caliber was shown on the dornish side was wrong also daerons decision to invade dorne was to complete what aegon started it had nothing to do with the raiding attacking dorne was only for glory and had no justification it was war for a mans pride its not hard to see why it didnt work and why it shouldnt have worked we can argue all day about who was right or wrong however war and battle was never going to make dorne apart of the seven kingdoms it didnt work with aegon and the dornish refused to let it work with daeron respect and honor was how to make them apart of the seven kingdoms and while that may or may not be disrespectful to the dead it in my opinion it ends up being respectful to the living which should be more important agreed about stone dornish being the only cool ones i love the daynes and wish we knew more about the fowlers and yronwoods
asoiaf,not_removed,actually the world book shows that dorne had been raiding the reach and the stormlands for thousands of years as shown by a dayne sacking oldtown and the rivalry between house oakheart and dayne where was the respect and honor for the iron throne and house targaryen it was the nost lopsided deal in westrosi history and can be compared to the trade deal with china under president clinton and nevile chamberlains deal with hitler giving up the sudatenland
asoiaf,not_removed,the dayne who sacked oldtown was a king of the torrentine which alone means it happened thousands of years ago as for thousands of years of raiding the north and the vale battled for the sisters for a thousand years and the north was able to put those squabbles aside the north supposedly attacked the sisters for the same reason youre arguing daeron attacked dorne to stop raiding but war didnt work peace did we dont hear of any more raiding after the peace with dorne and in fact tensions with highgarden relieved until oberyn cripples willas as for the whole political comparison im sorry im not a person who can appreciate it
asoiaf,not_removed,ned provides some evidence that hints that instead of being kidnapped lyanna likely ran away with rhaegar when he is scolding arya for fighting with sansa in kl in agot he compares her to lyanna he states that like arya lyanna had the wolfs blood and it led her to an early grave suggesting that lyannas wild and adventurous nature contributed to her downfall but you are right in that their relationship may not be as black and white as consensual or rapeykidnappy remember that at this time rhaegar was trying to fulfill the prophecy of the dragon has three heads who knows what the circumstances surrounding all of that was also even if it was consensual at first lyanna would probably be pretty pissed when she found out that rhaegars dad had burned her father and brother alive is there any evidence she even knew if she was in the toj all this time theres not a whole lot of news going in and out id reckon
asoiaf,not_removed,there are theories that benjen might have known about the affair and that he took the black out of shame for all the trouble that came of it he was the closest to lyanna since ned was being fostered in the vale and he might have helped her run off with rhaegar or covered for her when she was gone i dont know if it was consensual or not tbh its sketchy since rhaegar was older prophecyobsessed and a married dude but there are small things that could point to mutual admiration her appreciation of his music his possible covering up of her identity as the knight of the laughing tree ned not hating rhaegar in his thoughts like robert clearly does
asoiaf,not_removed,the show made it look like it was rape especially in the previously on when sansa tells lf how rhaegar kidnapped and raped lyanna which is pretty sad but there are still clues that point in the other direction the biggest one for me is that rhaegar whispers lyannas name right before he dies its complicated maybe he wanted a third head or maybe he found something out
asoiaf,not_removed,dothraki also have mounted archers with bows that out range any in westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,who has a couple hundred thousand soldiers though especially just after a war
asoiaf,not_removed,mongol horse archers army vikings army dornish ninjas army spartan army knights army dragons naval force biggest army westeros ever seen waterlandair superiority
asoiaf,not_removed,except we havent seen a dotyraki against a manatarms we saw him against a knight i would bet that their blades would do well against men in chain mail or boiled leather but swords wont do much if they are slicing but with the force of a horse behind them they can crush and smash
asoiaf,not_removed,if you factor in winter her chances are pretty much zero she cant feed or cloth her army so the elements will kill at the minimum a very large chunk of her army jon haa the advantage of defenceable terrian the rivers in the riverlands the mountains of the vale and the north itself
asoiaf,not_removed,she also has the reach and dorne
asoiaf,not_removed,you forget that they also have soldiers from dorne and highgarden as well as ironborn the issue is just how dany can coordinate all of these different armies into a cohesive force
asoiaf,not_removed,shes golden but thats boring so hopefully something happens if euron declares for fore cersei and goes out a big battle on the sea she could lose forces and make it harder but literally she has everyone once lannisters fall she owns all of it deal with euron and thats it he better come packing a cool dragon horn to make this a war worth watching
asoiaf,not_removed,assuming her forces all actually make it to westeros then yes im still in the camp that thinks a good many of them are going to get lost at sea
asoiaf,not_removed,your title is a spoiler if you repost with something different youll be good to go thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think cersei or lords of westeros is her main problem its ww
asoiaf,not_removed,dany at the end of dance with dragons has no chance of taking the throne she only has a couple thousand more men than aegriff but he has joncon and possible connections to westerosi nobility danydothraki could make a dent in the crownlands but still not a really good chance at taking kings landing danydothrakisecond sons under brown bentyrion have a good chance at taking the thronekings landing or rather westeros without vale dorne or north those three countries simply wont be taken through military means aegriff could have dorne or the vale or the north with a marriage to arianne sansa or arya dany cant have dorne through alliance not after quentyns roast but she could get the vale or the north through marriage to robertharry or branrickon her best bet though would be willas whod secure her the reach and thus a massive army and a shitload of resources the dothraki are fast they wont be in westeros the snow will be too deep for them lightly armoured which means they will freeze with curved swords meaning they depend on direct combat rather than sieges which is bad when you have limited resources and cant move around too quickly because of the snow get a couple hundred thousand well armoured troops and im not too sure the dothraki can win all you need from now on is an army that can survive winter conditions and the northernwildling armies and some vale troops seem to be the only ones that have that how many of them are there really men plus about not yet finished unsullied boys but that was before the pale mare and before the battle of meereen
asoiaf,not_removed,aside from patented boltontech bows
asoiaf,not_removed,except the giant bow and arrows not that those are a threat anymore i think
asoiaf,not_removed,this
asoiaf,not_removed,jon does but then again hes mostly worried about the zombie horde advancing towards him
asoiaf,not_removed,winter trumps all
asoiaf,not_removed,viking pirate army
asoiaf,not_removed,except we havent seen a dotyraki against a manatarms we saw him against a knight a man at arms is a soldier with all of the armor but none of the titles of a knight the hound for instance is a man at arms edit nevermind rechecked in game of thrones man at arms refers to a foot soldier
asoiaf,not_removed,mail is good aganist slashing blows so the arakh wont be it
asoiaf,not_removed,oh yeah forgot about those so who would oppose her then the north the vale and kings landing
asoiaf,not_removed,i think her problem with kl is the wildfire if she doesnt do it right cersei will just burn the whole city anyways
asoiaf,not_removed,jon has people less than half are fighters
asoiaf,not_removed,she has massive navy force to transport her entire army to anywhere she wants and long as she transports her army the westeros is pretty much empty place for her resist is futile
asoiaf,not_removed,psst theres no distinction to be made vikings were pirates when the opportunity arose
asoiaf,not_removed,not to mention in the real world men at arms could be knights steelshanks is a man at arms polliver locke show only guys like this they are well trained and well armed but they arent anywhere near as good as actual knights
asoiaf,not_removed,but with the force of a charging horse behind it the blade of the arakh turns almost into a hammer it wont slice it will crush or at least push allowing horses to trample and break the enemy formation at which point the foot soldiers run in after
asoiaf,not_removed,you also forgot so did i a little thing called dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,the north and the vale have declared independence or so i would assume with a new king of the north and the vale swearing for house stark they sure as hell wont come to the rescue of kings landing basically its the westerlands and kings landing with whats left of the riverlands and stormlands forces basically she has about a chance of winning in a straight up fight unless half her ships sink id aslo like to note weve seen what happens when they go up against a skilled knightman at arms and it aint in the dothrakis favor this seemed like an exception to me since jorah was such a skilled fighter he later brags to the slaver that he defeated a dothraki screamer in single combat aka it wasnt a small task
asoiaf,not_removed,i figure thats how theyll keep cersei alive until the season climax she threatens to scorch the earth and dany keeps away from kings landing for the season so cersei doesnt murder thousands of her people
asoiaf,not_removed,and that is the kicker she doesnt give a damn if she kills everyone and becomes queen of ashes if she gets corned shell be just like mad king if shes going down so is everyone else que jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,only about wildlings were let through the wall by the end of adwd
asoiaf,not_removed,thats still fighters
asoiaf,not_removed,they look like pirates in the show
asoiaf,not_removed,that didnt always happen the soliders arent just standing there while the dothraki are charging them down they will be raising their shields and spears to fight aganist the dothraki
asoiaf,not_removed,facepalms so i did damn westeros is gonna get messed up
asoiaf,not_removed,they wont be much useful in the north thoughif dragons can be grounded by storms imagine what happens in the middle of blizzards
asoiaf,not_removed,this seemed like an exception to me since jorah was such a skilled fighter to be fair the sword got stuck in his armor
asoiaf,not_removed,oh yeah thats right not that many were willing to follow tormund
asoiaf,not_removed,wildlings have almost no armor and are on foot the khalasar would annihilate them also as somebody else pointed out only came through the wall so they are even more insignificant
asoiaf,not_removed,not particularly though they hardly look like vikings either my point is that vikings are pirates
asoiaf,not_removed,clearly his skill with the armor allowed it to trap the blade
asoiaf,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchviwualmpmpow i never got the impression it was stuck in his armor but rather jorah trapped the blade between his armor and since the blade was curved around his abdomen it couldnt be pulled back perhaps the books actually do say it was stuck in the armor i dunno and rewatching the clip it is certainly not a one sided fight
asoiaf,not_removed,this is not my theory but one i stumbled across a few months ago and didnt see here i posted this to see what everyone else thought i wanted to add this to the post itself but im still relatively new to reddit and im not seeing it on mobile
asoiaf,not_removed,i think this is a bad move for dany she may be able to take the city and gain the further support of the dothraki but the risk is too great she would still have to take all the dothraki across the wastes and lose many in the process then she arrives at qarth tired from the march and facing a formidable city dragons certainly can turn the tide of battle but its seems to me the risk isnt worth the reward no matter how tempting it is that being said it would be cool as hell to finally get to see some good old destruction from dany and her dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,madeinmyr are absolutely amazing and everyone reading this should stop whatever theyre doing and fall headfirst into some of the best and most original theories out there
asoiaf,not_removed,nice theory it would give dnay something to do besides just go to scars dothrak return to meereb and then leave for westeros i hope grrm ties all the loose knots dang has in the east before she goes south she told the quartheen that shell return with fire and blood one day if she did t get what she wanted well that day is here
asoiaf,not_removed,how will say dothraki cross the red waste there is barely and food and water there
asoiaf,not_removed,yes theyre some of the best and most well thought out theories ive read
asoiaf,not_removed,magic is cooler when its dangerous a game of thrones at its heart is not a story about magic its a story driven by the characters were introduced to and their responses to the problems theyre faced with the oftquoted human heart in conflict with itself is at the core of asoiaf while everything else is just set dressing magic is introduced as an unwieldy element in the story with exceedingly high costs for its use agot is one of the least magicfilled books of the series with only two instances of magical events taking place mirri maz durrs saving of khal drogo and the dragons hatching dany xagot is the last chapter of the book and contains the funeral pyre scene and is the one were going to be talking about today this chapter introduces the most dangerous character in the series darkstar who is of the night magic magic itself isnt a power that characters are able to wield without problem there is no one all powerful sorcerer with the ability to fix everything with a wave of his wand if theres any one hero he or she will succeed in spite of the cost magic will exact rather than because of magics helping hand we dont know what that price will be but given magics previous cost we know it wont come cheap you have to have dragons its a fantasy you know magic may not have been included at all in asoiaf were it not for an early conversation grrm had with a friend in in the dedication of asos grrm writes for phyllis who made me put the dragons in grrm explained what this meant the dragons were one aspect that i did consider not including very early in the process i was debating should i do this just as like historical fiction about fake history and have no actually overt magic or magical elements but my friend phyllis eisenstein a wonderful fantasy writer who lives here in chicago i happened to be talking to her at very early stage in the process phyllis has written some great fantasies herself she said nah you have to have dragons its a fantasy you know and i dedicated a storm of swords to phyllis who made me put the dragons in and i think that was the right thing to do not only were dragons not originally in the earliest plans for asoiaf magic itself wasnt going to be overtly involved either two years after the conversation grrm submitted some agot chapters along with a summary of where he saw the overall story as it was planned then going the and the subsequent analysis from it is fantasic reading on its own ignoring the rest of the plans grrms original idea for dany is interesting over across the narrow sea daenerys targaryen will discover that her new husband the dothraki khal drogo has little interest in invading the seven kingdoms much to her brothers frustration when viserys presses his claims past the point of tact or wisdom khal drogo will finally grow annoyed and kill him out of hand eliminating the targaryen pretender and leaving daenerys as the last of her line danerys sic will bide her time but she will not forget when the moment is right she will kill her husband to avenge her brother and then flee with a trusted friend into the wilderness beyond vaes dothrak there hunted by dothraki bloodriders of her life she stumbles on a cache of dragons eggs the birth of a young dragon will give daenerys the power to bend the dothraki to her will then she begins to plan for her invasion of the seven kingdoms in the earliest plans for agot dany finds a cache of dragon eggs in the dothraki sea but only one of the eggs hatches as the writing progressed grrm instead had ilyrio gift the eggs to dany as a wedding present with all three hatching later by this point magic was sprinkled into the story sorcery is a sword without a hilt grrm keeps the usage of magic sparing perhaps because his original plan was a historical fiction with the layer of magic added later the magical elements are only sprinkled throughout the story rather than applied with a trowel during a httpteamcococomvideogeorgerrmartinwasntsurehewanteddragonsingameofthrones grrm explains his reasoning it certainly makes it grittier and more realistici think magic has to be handled very carefully in fantasy phyllis was right you need some magic in a fantasy but too much magic is like too much salt in the stew all you can taste is the salt and anything can happen too much magic makes the story unbelieveable events or actions can be hand waved away with magic as an explanation grrms use of magic is differentiating from other fantasy authors who create entire systems that can be studied at magic school in the grrm explained that such sparing use was on purpose grrm magic is cooler when its dangerous youre messing with forces you dont understand maybe you think you understand them but itll turn around and bite you in the ass nowhere is the idea that magic is dangerous more evident than the two scenes in which we see it in agot in her attempt to save drogo dany pleads with mirri maz duur to heal him mmd tells dany the price either purposely misleadingly or dany subconsciously ignores dany thinks shes buying drogos life with that of his stallions instead drogos life such as it became was paid for with rhaegos the sparing usage of magic in asoiaf should indicate that when its used its important a magical event taking place in asoiaf isnt just another detail it means something its purposefully there to tell us something or lead the characters somewhere magic in asoiaf isnt mere world building magic itself is another character in the story one thats dangerous and uncontrollable dalla tells jon sometimes the short road is not the safest jon snow the horned lord once said that sorcery is a sword without a hilt there is no safe way to grasp it the horned lord is scarcely mentioned in the books except to say that he was a king beyond the wall who used sorcery to pass the wall the free folk named a constellation of stars is named for him interestingly the same constellation is called the stallion south of the wall tying it to dany and the stallion who mounts the world is too tempting to ignore but too unsupported to do anything beyond mention it the glass candles are burning the red comet makes its first appearance in this chapter as the first star visible in the night sky in an earlier draft of danys chapters in agot the comet appeared sooner after dany recovers from the miscarriage of rhaego and learns of drogos fate she tries to rouse him from his comalike state with all the pillow tricks doreah taught her before she begins dany sees the red comet in the sky and takes it for a good omen the comet was moved from the earlier chapter to the funeral pyre scene giving it the role of a more imminent omen heralding the dragons birth the birth of drogon viserion and rhaegal was a magical event explicitly heralded by the red comet danys immunity to fire in this chapter was a one time magical event it gives me a chance to clear up a common misconception targaryens are not immune to fire the birth of danys dragons was unique magical wonderous a miracle she is called the unburnt because she walked into the flames and lived but her brother sure as hell wasnt immune to that molten gold this was the magic event of the book and of the series so far this miracle causes magic to seep back into the world after it had drained away with the destruction of valyria the alchemists making wildfire note that its stronger firemages are creating foot high ladders of fire instead of little puffs magic is returning and practitioners are slowly becoming more powerful an observation about the idea of magic being gone and coming back is that grrm didnt need to explain history in magical terms the little that he did include is couched in the tall tales of old nan or the religious teachings of septons the current characters untouched by magic exist in their own storylines as regular people readers can relate to them easily without having to suspend belief too often it is not your screams i want only your lifei remember what you told me only death can pay for life grrms magic is a dangerous character its purposely unwieldy removing a catchall for the other characters to use as a deus ex machina using magic doesnt come without a heavy price only death can pay for life a babys death for a husbands a heros for vengeance personified magic doesnt save our characters the funeral pyre in dany x brings the story its greatest magical addition with the three dragons thanks phyllis and introduces a new element of danger to the story after all magic is cooler when its dangerous
asoiaf,not_removed,the marriage metaphor of magic right before dany steps into drogos funeral pyre she looks into the flames she had sensed the truth of it long ago dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration but the brazier had not been hot enough the flames writhed before her like the women who had danced at her wedding whirling and singing and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils fearsome to behold yet lovely so lovely alive with heat dany opened her arms to them her skin flushed with glowing this is a wedding too she thought mirri maz durr had fallen silent the godswife thought her a child but children grow and children learn ive been utterly baffled by the hatching of danys dragons how did she pull it off how did she succeed when so many people who knew magic more than her failed and to top it off she casually mentions that she sees it as a wedding right before she takes the plunge but the more i thought about what this is a wedding meant the more things started to make sense i believe that the magic that hatched danys dragons is best understood in terms of a marriage pact the traditional way to hatch throughout history there are a number of successful dragon hatching events that did not involve a funeral pyre a red comment and a burnt maegi but even if they didnt understand it its clear that the targaryen dragon riders had a tradition that was effective but at viseryss command each had a dragons egg placed in his cradle and each egg hatched producing the dragons vermax arrax and tyraxes by placing dragon eggs in the cradle targ parents are setting up a situation for a deep emotional bond with the eggs its unclear what the actual required relationship is for a successful hatching but the bond between a child and their teddy bear or their safety blanket is one of the strongest bonds a young child is capable of hatching dragons is clearly more about having a relationship than brute mechanics no one does a wedding like grrm lets take a look at what marriage means in this world we see marriage after marriage made to unite two houses or in order to secure some military significant asset from the freys to tyrell from cersei to catlyn there is a definite exchange but that exchange is rarely ever simple yes but when when the khal chooses illyrio said he will have the girl first and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at vaes dothrak after that perhaps if the omens favor war viserys seethed with impatience i piss on dothraki omens i counsel you to be patient your grace the dothraki are true to their word but they do things in their own time a lesser man may beg a favor from the khal but must never presume to berate him viserys bristled the dragon does not beg many people have been frustrated by magic they paid the price but wanted results immediately but similar to how drogo accepts the gift but then gives its repayment later and in his own way magic also takes its time the dragon does not beg if i look back i am lost unlike many of the other people who tried to hatch dragons dany is free to marry her last known family member viserys was killed by her husband her unborn baby was killed and sacrificed to save her husband and dany herself mercy killed her brain dead husband at this point she has nothing left to hold her back shes not desperate or planning on using the eggs to solve some other problem as emotionally raw as she is shes in the perfect place for hatching eggs the dragon does not fear after receiving drogos bride gift dany takes her for a ride and for the first time in hours she forgot to be afraid or perhaps it was for the first time everdany found herself moving faster than she had intended yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying something about riding a horse turned dany around and showed her what it was like to be unafraid then suddenly her confidence vanishes viserys slid close to dany on her silver dug her fingers into her leg and said please him sweet sister or i swear you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before the fear came back to her then with her brothers words she felt like a child once more only thirteen and all alone not ready for what was about to happen to her so for dany fear turns her into a child mirri thought of her as a child and children cannot do blood magic but with nothing left dany has nothing to lose and her fear is now burnt away not the words nor the wisdom while dany is building the pyre mirri says to dany it is not enough to kill a horse by itself the blood is nothing you do not have the words to make a spell nor the wisdom to find them do you think bloodmagic is a game for children you call me maegi as if it were a curse but all it means is wise you are a child with a childs ignorance whatever you mean to do it will not work you need to speak the right language and then say the right things in order for magic to happen but danys earlier wedding shows that you dont need to speak the language in order to make a marriage pact there was no one to talk to khal drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders and laughed at their replies but he scarcely glanced at dany beside him they had no common language dothraki was incomprehensible to her and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard valyrian of the free cities and none at all of the common tongue of the seven kingdoms so a cocky mirri seems to think that dany doesnt have a chance but her confidence begins to ebb dany poured the oil over the womans head herself i thank you mirri maz durr she said for the lessons you have taught me you will not hear me scream mirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing i will danny said but it is not your screams i want only your life i remember what you told me only death can pay for life mirri maz duur opened her mouth but made no reply as she stepped away dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegis flat black eyes in its place was something that might have been fear but on their wedding night dany realizes that drogo has learned the word no in the common tongue perhaps he had only that word she thought but it was one more than she had known he had and somehow it made her feel a little better so perhaps knowing just a few words is all that is needed to break the ice with whatever magical exists and that knowledge is enough to put fear into the heart of a maegi callback after callback due to word count requirements for this tournament i wont be able cover all the callbacks but do yourself a favor and read dany x and dany iii back to back before mounting the funeral pyre and meeting her husband dany takes a bath gets her hair brushed and gets anointed with perfume in a cough memorable way there are slight differences but they are clearly callbacks hair brushed until it was a river of liquid silver dany x vs shone like molten silver dany i and her anointing was now on the tips of her milkheavy breasts instead of just breasts then there is the refusal during the giving of the bride gifts before the pyre dany offers her blood riders the bride gifts she received at her wedding you are khaleesi rakharo said taking the arakh i shall ride at your side to vaes dothrak beneath the mother of mountains and keep you safe from harm until you take your place with the crones of the dosh khaleen no more can i promise she nodded as calmly as if she had not heard his answer they refused because it is not a womans place to lead a khalasar this is clearly a callback to her wedding when dany had to refuse these gifts because they were not meant for a woman but for her husband magister illyrio had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings this is a gift worthy of a great warrior oh blood of my blood and i am but a woman let my lord husband bear these in my stead and so khal drogo too received bride gifts part below only votes on this comment will be counted
asoiaf,not_removed,how good a metaphor is this i hope ive established that viewing drogos funeral pyre in the context of a marriage helps explain things but does it go beyond this one event can we use it to explain all magic in asoiaf eh not really but it can still explain a lot there are a number of places where it absolutely makes sense haggon describes to varamyr that wolves and women wed for life you take one thats a marriage brans eating of the weirwood paste would wed him to the trees mirri maz duur is literally called a gods wife the union of mel and stannis while not monogamous still could be considered a less powerful paramour relationship that can still produce demonstrable results if you take a further step back and squint your eyes a bit you could even say that sams oath in front of a heart tree gave him the magical whatever to go through the black gate perhaps the pact that ended the war between the cotf and the first men can be viewed as analogous to a marriage pact but other places the metaphor falls apart i cant figure out how to bend the faceless men magic alchemists wildfire squishers glass candles or any number of other weird magical phenomenon to fit this model still mirri maz durr does make clear that blood magic is different and darker than other forms of magic why would grrm set up his world this way this has a number of benefits for grrm first of all it gives him wiggle room he doesnt have to be a slave to his magical system he can make magic a fickle mistress that you will never fully understand he can mess with the timing secondly it plants the seeds of much tragedy he can have someone sacrifice everything in the hope that it will kick off some magical thing and then have it initially not work and the characters have to face the horror of sacrificing a loved one for nothing only death can pay for life so to tie it all together marriage is an interesting and fruitful way to look at magic in grrms world i hope ive shown that dany herself views the funeral pyre as a wedding weddings are clearly important for grrm and this strengthens the theme the marriage metaphor help explain many of the quirks of grrms magical system grrm has deliberately chose similar wording and events for dany x and dany iii a dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair the same applies for funerals if only death can pay for life then a dead brother a dead son and a dead husband can eventually pay for the lives of three dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,his wife was a dumb whore with a fat arse did you know that

asoiaf,not_removed,the doors of stone been a few years now since a wise mans fear btw there is a new dragon ball series but no dub although the filma condensed version of it is dubbed
asoiaf,not_removed,the gaps between books and and books and of the dark tower were years each and we had the added tension of stephen king getting hit by a van and nearly dying then after faced with his own mortality stephen king rushed the last and lets just say they were less than we were hoping for of course waiting years for a jon dany or tyrion chapter really sucked too with the wait resulting in two of the three povs beingdisappointing dany dithering and emotyrion so i dont really know if dark tower or asoiaf was the worst wait you cant really analogize anime for whatever reason those studios love leaving money on the table and not properly finishing their stories the worst of all mediumsprobably or the wait between back to the future and cliffhanger and to be continued endings ugh
asoiaf,not_removed,i waited about years between fallout new vegas and fallout i waited so long i actually didnt believe it at first when it was announced i didnt fully believe it until i had a copy of the damn game in my hands im pretty sure i wont believe twow coming into fruition until halfway through my reread

asoiaf,not_removed,wisconsin badgers national championship and they were so close so recently twelve years since i showed up there as a freshman counting the years before that feels like cheating i should specify football or basketball they got one in hockey while i was in school there but hockeys never really been something i follow

asoiaf,not_removed,i tried watching super with subtitles but growing up watching the english version i just couldnt deal with japanese gokus voice resurrection f was cool i enjoyed that also i havent read the book you mentioned but im guessing youd recommend that particular series
asoiaf,not_removed,i have the dark tower series on my bookshelf but i havent gotten round to reading it yet the opinion that stephen king is rubbish at writing endings seems to be a popular one as much shit as george seems to get for being a slow writer i hope he doesnt rush and release a poor ending to the series as neil gaiman said grrm is not your bitch so if him taking years to write means great books thats fine by me
asoiaf,not_removed,but did your wait worth it i am a huge fallout fan too i loved most everything about fallout except the ending there was no montagefallout explained by narrator of all the decisions we made plus story wise also it was not as evocative personally new vegas is still my favorite
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,im a grrm fan and a sanderson fan i spend half my time waiting and the other half joking about sanderson accidentally writing another book while working on the planned ones its very confusing you should join us

asoiaf,not_removed,if toronto makes it to the playoffs the riots in toronto after the game regardless of whether we won or lost will be worse than vancouver after they lost
asoiaf,not_removed,eagles have never won a super bowl our last championship was the nfl championship game before there even was a super bowl
asoiaf,not_removed,dan and dave equals tyrion
asoiaf,not_removed,it is known
asoiaf,not_removed,the kingkiller chronicles by patrick rothfuss is awesome i have also bee waiting for the doors of stone the supposed name for the third of the trilogy i cant recommend the series enough
asoiaf,not_removed,definitely one of my favorite fantasy series its just the author is nearly as slow to write as grrm
asoiaf,not_removed,dark tower was one of the best epic series ive read theres a reason why people are buzzing about the upcoming movie that being said the last books were not as good as the first some folks hate book i liked it because i liked the glimpse into the past world endings are really hard to pull off id say around of the long form stories ive watched or read are what i would call good the only ending which enraged me was sopranos cut to black where the showrunner essentially flicked off the audience to feel good about his years of exploiting violence and popularizing the antihero even bsg lost and didnt piss me off like most folks but ive read a ton so ive learned to be tolerant towards weaker endings best ending ive seen in any medium was code geass while the series went off the rails a little bit the ending was pitch perfect and the use of photographs at the end efficiently gave closure for all the characters major and minor with a little tease at the end dt probably wouldnt hit my of most disappointing endings ever to give you some perspective i have three autographed books in my library a storm of swords from grrms bookstore a memory of light i got signed during sanderson and harriets book tour and the dark tower autographed by sk because an exgirlfriends father was kings pharmacist as far as pacing ive gotten used to really slow churning epic series by now i started reading dark tower sometime in the and asoiaf the year agot came out its just something you have to put up with if you like these types of books sort of like you have to put up with good anime almost never having proper endings would i like it if grrm wouldcould write faster sure will i harass the poor guy about it absolutely not
asoiaf,not_removed,that whole situation was just bonkers
asoiaf,not_removed,i got to attend one of the preview screenings before the movie was in general release there werent really a lot of spoilers available for the film that i was aware of so it was all fresh and new when that moment happened the guy in front of me actually jumped up in his seat and shouted no in a display of genuine anguish it was a red weddingy sort of moment
asoiaf,not_removed,yo wtf im not talking about rape
asoiaf,not_removed,family is all from cleveland we were all so excited for johnny football what a piece of shit manziel ended up being on and off the field hopefully rgiii doesnt disappoint things are looking up at least lebron and irving brought us some much neededdeserved glory
asoiaf,not_removed,mariners fan checking in
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah the raise was a bluff
asoiaf,not_removed,at cheating lol
asoiaf,not_removed,they were in the playoffs in both and now a lions playoff win is a different story
asoiaf,not_removed,but you guys get snow in the winter right so maybe thatll slow things down
asoiaf,not_removed,if youre unfamiliar with it put your tinfoil hat on and be ready to have your mind blown
asoiaf,not_removed,just prepare to get the grrmstyle delay any who dare to read the kingkiller chronicle wmf came out in and its creeping up there good series though the magic is extremely well explained and dealt with more like science which makes it tolerable as a magichater
asoiaf,not_removed,i was hoping id bump into a true fantasyscifi book nerd so this is perfect ive also got the wheel of time on my shelf which i think is being made into a show so what would you recommend i read first also feel free to throw any other book recommendationssuggestions my way on the anime thing the japanese sure do know how to milk a franchise pokemon attack on titan naruto etc
asoiaf,not_removed,sure buddy
asoiaf,not_removed,if cleveland doesnt build lebron a statute your family should abandon the city he led the team to not only deliver the city a much needed win but they slayed the invincible monster in the process too bad about johnny football im a fan of another sec team and had high hopes for his career but he wasnt the first promising talent to get derailed by drugs and partying and he wont be the last hopefully rgiii can resurrect his career but at least you guys got some smart management finally
asoiaf,not_removed,if you were excited for manziel you really werent paying attention that trainwreck was visible miles away
asoiaf,not_removed,in i was years old anxiously getting ready to watch super bowl my dad turns to me and says you know the last time the eagles were in the super bowl i was years old i joked about my nonexistent son being the next time they make it my nowexistent son turns week and that whole sad joke is getting closer to the truth
asoiaf,not_removed,im british so you guys making such a big deal about deflategate makes no sense to me especially considering how prevalent peds wereare in american sports mostly in the nfl and baseball right
asoiaf,not_removed,deflategate is a bunch of nonsense and you know it
asoiaf,not_removed,if you think snow will slow canadians down youre wrong major ice storms not included
asoiaf,not_removed,im not really a magic hater but i was amazed with the way he put it in those books i check his blog weekly for news on the next book
asoiaf,not_removed,lol i remember the good ol days before we were cool with conventions and the cheerleaders carrying out minicomputers in their purses between wot and dt i guess it comes down to why do you like asoiaf do you like it because of the fantasy and world building or the complex characters if its the former then id recommend wot first if the latter i would say dt you cant go wrong with either before asoiaf these were the two great epics of the and id say they beat everything ive read so far postasoiaf anime is really weird youre right they milk the shit out of the stuff like naruto but then you have something like code geass or black lagoon begging for more seasons and theyre all like nope were out srychan oh well at least were pretty much guaranteed to get some more steinsgate and attack of titan someday and how did they fuck up a gantz adaptation and never go back until a cgi movie over years later mindboggling
asoiaf,not_removed,youre the one automatically assuming rape that says more about you
asoiaf,not_removed,mate you are quite literally who i hope i am in years time still passionate about awesome stuff like this i hope silly things like a career or a wife dont temper my enthusiasm oh and thanks a lot for the advice guess im reading dt first cause in case my name tag didnt shout it out loudly jaime is my favourite asoiaf character
asoiaf,not_removed,sure pal jokes aside were just joking we dont actually think youre talking about rape
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks enjoy dt its a great journey only other advice i can offer is marry well like i did
asoiaf,not_removed,i dunno hes getting pretty defensive
asoiaf,not_removed,id say its because marwyns the only one who intends to warn dany of the long night he might not be collaborating directly with quaithe but they probably both have the same goal in that regard tyrion and the others want her to get involved in the politics of westeros which quaithe likely considers a dangerous distraction
asoiaf,not_removed,kraken is victarion dark flame is moqorro lion is tyrion and the suns son is quyenton martell but who is the griffen
asoiaf,not_removed,definitely think the perfumed seneschal is varys but very interesting theory the whole burning candle aspect is one of my favorite topics in the book
asoiaf,not_removed,just thought of this right now what if marwyn is the mummers dragon get myself to slavers bay in aemons place maybe marwyn is being literal meaning that he will disguise himself as aemon targaryen to get close to dany most people think that aegon is the mummers dragon but the lion and griffon are already mentioned so aegon might be included with tyrion and jon connington since they are all traveling together
asoiaf,not_removed,another possibility is that she did not warn her about marwyn because he will never reach her but thats a depressing thought
asoiaf,not_removed,dont have time to look it up but there is a theory that perfumed seneschal is associated with marwyn
asoiaf,not_removed,a seneschal is defined as the steward or majordomo of a medieval great house a governor or other administrative or judicial officer and perfumed means wearing perfume obvi so you really need to look at people who meet those characteristics before just slotting in anyone you want the people who meet both of those definitions should be strongly considered the most obvious choice the one that danaerys herself considers is reznak mo reznak he is a seneschal and he wears perfume it could just be that dany has solved this part of the prophecy without any help from the reader forcing varys or anyone into the role give her some credit not everything is a fakeout marwyn is not a seneschal hes a maester varys illyrio and others are not seneschals i cant remember any of them explicitly wearing perfume maybe dany just figured this part out
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont recall the interview i read it in but i remember grrm stating that he was a little hamstrung by writing that prophecy so early he had ideas for character direction that had changed over the years and felt that it was more challenging to keep his characters on that path not to say he wont make good on the prophecy but maybe its taken this long for some of the players to show up it does make an interesting link between marwyn and quaithe now we have seen the candle in westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,his rank is archmaester sir respect his authoritai
asoiaf,not_removed,this is how ive been interpreting it too quaithe and marwyn likely have the same goal so she has no reason to warn dany about him it doesnt necessarily mean they are working together just that they want the same result honestly unless grrm has some big reveal in the last two books i really doubt quaithe will have a big role in any way i dont feel like shes actively contributing to the plot in any way just trying to guide dany with cryptic messages is this her only gameplan is she doing something else to further her ends doesnt really seem like it i dont know s maybe shell pop up in meereen after the battle of fire or something to take a more active role
asoiaf,not_removed,jon connington
asoiaf,not_removed,im more inclined to believe that the seneschal is either illyrio or the ship but my third suspect would be varys too
asoiaf,not_removed,but it doesnt say the mummer dragon it says mummers the mummer dragon would imply someone impersonating a dragon which aegon xi could be too if hes not actually a blackfyre but i think varys is the mummer so aegon would be his dragon
asoiaf,not_removed,i never thought about that nice catch
asoiaf,not_removed,yes i mentioned it in the end but it is more likely that the seneschal is another person or even the ship there is even a comment in this thread about someone who thinks the mummers dragon might be marwyn since hes going in aemons place
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont feel like shes actively contributing to the plot in any way just trying to guide dany with cryptic messages is this her only gameplan is she doing something else to further her ends doesnt really seem like it same quaithe is cool and all but structurally shes kind of baffling my guess is that he had more planned for her back when dany was going to go to asshai
asoiaf,not_removed,heres the thing though why would quaith show up in mereen when she already has a means for communication with her now that i think about it why hasnt marwyn done the same he has a candle and wants to help her
asoiaf,not_removed,yep if i recall this is before tyrion convinces aegon to change coursegets kidnapped so lion and griffin are en route together odd that theyre paired up in such a way though vicmoquorro tyrionjc quentaegon
asoiaf,not_removed,i think grrm is playing us on this one my money is on it being the obvious answer reznak
asoiaf,not_removed,i think it could easily be all three
asoiaf,not_removed,ah good point
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i kind of have that vibe too and you cant really pin down what her goals are other than she hasnt warned against marwyn melisandre is from asshai but shes team stannis moqorro is red priest like mel but clearly he and the rest of rhllors followers wants to back dany but maybe that shouldnt be what were rooting for unless were supposed to distrust marwyn quaithe or maybe all of these people and danys got to make her own call oh no ive gone crosseyed
asoiaf,not_removed,i think we can assume shes using a glass candle to talk to daenerys yeah iirc shes only communicated with dany this way when dany is all by herself maybe theres a limitation to glass candles if they want to give more robustcompleteconstant advice it may still be necessary to be with her in person
asoiaf,not_removed,vm travel together tjc are advisors aq are hopeful suitors
asoiaf,not_removed,if youre right about the timing that explains it i knew jcs crest is the griffen but i thought thatd be to obviousredundant
asoiaf,not_removed,he is messing with us one of the biggest book mysteries i tend to think its illyrio
asoiaf,not_removed,i think jon arryn wanted robert arryn to be fostered at dragonstone we do not know how long jon and stannis were doing research on the incest if matters had come a head arryn would not approve of having sweet robin as tywins hostage it would limit possible action against cersei and jaime jon arryn would want robin safe and in trustworthy hands lysa may have heard casterly rock however any hint at incest would exclude that possibility jon arryn would not share that information with lysa in fact it would not matter to lysa if he had it would mean taking sweet robin from her she would not allow that
asoiaf,not_removed,im imagining euron or somebody else using his armor punching the shit out of the others why would euron punch the shit out of the others why all this violence i think he could give them a good hug and be done with itlol
asoiaf,not_removed,excuse me but the only pirate who might be able to do that is victarion greyjoy hes got the firey fist and the zombies are the bodies who are weak to fire not the others
asoiaf,not_removed,i had a about months ago when i noticed in my current reread that dagmer cleftjaw had rings with obsidian gems i hadnt considered eurons valyrian steel armor at the time longclaw certainly seemed effective in the show so this might be a possibility if nothing else it might provide more effective armor against the others than traditional ringmail and steel plate has so far
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,this raises another question could he do a rugby charge through the others and shatter them
asoiaf,not_removed,im very disappointed he didnt show up in wearing this armor in dying to see it in live action the illustrations dont seem to do it justice
asoiaf,not_removed,im going to predict it now euron is going to be cooked inside his armor jon is going to wear it and lead the ground attack against the others while his aunt wife takes to the skies and recreates the field of fire
asoiaf,not_removed,when i read the title i was thinking of victarion punching others with his volcano arm which would be insane levels of awesome
asoiaf,not_removed,euron is not a pirate hooker the dusky woman would be a pirate hooker but anyway yeah i think he probably could i think that the fact that euron made a damn suit of armour out of vsteel is a bit of a flashy show of power i do believe that euron must have more valyrian steel items as well
asoiaf,not_removed,the armour doesnt have guantlets or sleeves its a shirt more then a suit its most likely sleeveless or has short sleeves
asoiaf,not_removed,i doubt that valyrian steel is as potent against the others as it is on the tvshow i expect that the advantage it gives is more along the lines of just not shattering from the cold the way waymars sword did so no i do not expect punching to be an effective way to kill them
asoiaf,not_removed,i think that armor would be impervious to their weapons like jon with long claw still looses to old man winters if he gets hit first so get a bit of armor and your basically indestructible
asoiaf,not_removed,well if we go off of the tv show the obsidian ritual involving an actual thrusting if the dagger implying that obsidians killing others property might be linked to actually ripping into the skin andor drawing blood whatever they have for blood thus far valyrian steel and obsidian seem to work pretty much the same in the tv show as far as killing others goes from this i would assume that punching an other with a valyrian steel glove probably wouldnt kill them neither would hitting one with the flat of a sword or lightly tapping with a sword etc you can notice that the others whove died have had the weapons employed against them fairly normally with hard thrusts and powerful cuts not just like a light tap on the shoulder that magically killed them
asoiaf,not_removed,upvoted this comment cause you made me lul upvoted a bunch more of your posts cause your name thefeelz
asoiaf,not_removed,he could take the armor from his brothers dead corpse
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but valyrian steel kils them which means their swords will not penetrate valyiran armor
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought for sure it was about victarion
asoiaf,not_removed,the brawlin brotha
asoiaf,not_removed,heh ive wondered before if crowfood umber was going to pop out his obsidian eye and jam it in to the mouth of an other
asoiaf,not_removed,the armor likely only covers his torso
asoiaf,not_removed,man if euron turns out to be the hero westeros needs but not the one it deserves which would be the walkers
asoiaf,not_removed,jon isnt tall enough to wear that hed need a very skilled armored to fit jon in maybe gendry
asoiaf,not_removed,why not victarion could take the valyrian armor from euron then we would have fiery arm valyrian steel combo
asoiaf,not_removed,pirate pimp i must say it has a certain ring to it
asoiaf,not_removed,has this been confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,but it does bring up a really interesting idea catapults filled with obsidianwildfire mix nail bombs goodbye white walker
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks you are most kind ser seven blessingslol
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe they use a breastplate stretcher but maybe in all seriousness it is adjustable
asoiaf,not_removed,he trades in booty so butt pirate wait
asoiaf,not_removed,no but scale armor is almost never fully sleeved with valyria being a paralell to rome i would imagine it would look similar to roman scale armor that night he wore a shirt of iron scales and a cloak of blood red silk his eyepatch was red leather his lips blue while he describes the shirt as iron the bad lighting with aerons deteriorating mental state might have made him mistake valyrian steel for iron i dont see why one would wear iron when they have valyrian steel armor using the word shirt is kind of revealing if it was the same set of armor
asoiaf,not_removed,yipee ki yay mother fuckers
asoiaf,not_removed,well lancel went off to look for one loke years ago but no ones heard from him recently
asoiaf,not_removed,dirka dirka wildfire jihad
asoiaf,not_removed,i hear he has a bright future ahead of him
asoiaf,not_removed,and behind him really hes surrounded by a bright future
asoiaf,not_removed,i love the fact that brandon loved brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,and nobody loved barristan
asoiaf,not_removed,til the tourney at harrenhal was high school but didnt ashara love ned
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought ashara loved ned back
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei is the only one with two outgoing love lines i can respect that
asoiaf,not_removed,all this mess and only two persons had sex i think this explains everything makelovenotwar
asoiaf,not_removed,cat loved brandon she definitely thought he was good looking but other than that i dont think she really cared that much
asoiaf,not_removed,hang on brandon and ashara were a thing
asoiaf,not_removed,brandon only loves himself
asoiaf,not_removed,that m on jaime isnt your average m its a super m
asoiaf,not_removed,everybody loves rhaegar
asoiaf,not_removed,nedbert missing
asoiaf,not_removed,afaik it isnt confirmed that the stark who slept with ashara was brandon she looked towards stark but which one is a speculation let me know if there is something to suggest otherwise havent read anything since awoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,everybody loves rhaemond
asoiaf,not_removed,edit til jon connington is apparently gay oops
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the most crucially overlooked thing here is that jaime and cersei arent banging
asoiaf,not_removed,brandon stark has got to be the single most presumedupon character in the series there is absolutely evidence that brandon and ashara had sex
asoiaf,not_removed,this is why the only good spinoff for hbo is roberts rebellion you could use this chart at a pitch meeting basically
asoiaf,not_removed,brandon loved himself
asoiaf,not_removed,do we know ashara made love to brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,coming to cbs this fall everybody loves rhaegar
asoiaf,not_removed,barristan was like years older then everyone else some might say he was the wooderson of westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,new westerosi sitcom everybody loves rhaegar
asoiaf,not_removed,elias arrow to rhaegar is questionable rhaegar and lyanna should be a question mark a green equal is my guess as to their relationship but red arrows are just a guess too people like to imagine this torrid love affair between rhaegar and lyanna but its more martins style to be a drunken mistake on the run too much to drink good friends who want to see if more is there oops we made azor ahai and fractured the kingdom into civil war our bad or maybe life was just like all the songs notice the only other paired red arrows on your diagram are siblings
asoiaf,not_removed,should there not be a made love to between rhaegar and lyanna
asoiaf,not_removed,did cersei love rhaegar i missed this
asoiaf,not_removed,wait lyanna loved rhaegar damn a lot of people loved rhaegar dude was pretty popular no wonder robert was jealous
asoiaf,not_removed,poor ned and robert they werent loved
asoiaf,not_removed,do we know for sure that ashara and brandon made love
asoiaf,not_removed,ashara was the original bad poosey
asoiaf,not_removed,brandon be like
asoiaf,not_removed,wait wait wait ashara fucked brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,we dont know which stark ashara hooked up with
asoiaf,not_removed,um jon arryn edit also i feel so bad for elia and cat and wheres the text proof of ashara and brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,the brandon loving himself thing fucking killed me
asoiaf,not_removed,or someones headcannon of what happened at the tourney of harrenhal
asoiaf,not_removed,ugh brandon and ashara makes hardly any sense
asoiaf,not_removed,who is ashara again
asoiaf,not_removed,that jon with no c afterward you intentionally trying to mess with casual fans or what also i think youre missing a few made love to connections like jaime and cersei love the brandon loving himself though rhaegar may also have been similar at that point
asoiaf,not_removed,i get the feeling that rhaegar wasnt in love with anyone he seems like he was quite tortured he couldve had mental illness who knows depression maybe
asoiaf,not_removed,half of the people on the scheme were not even present at the tourney ashara and brandon not confirmed bad scheme
asoiaf,not_removed,love it but im going to be a bit nitpicky and say i personally dont think lyanna loved rhaegar
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its pretty obvious from the text that brandon didnt fuck ashara in the tale the reeds tell bran brandon talked to ashara for ned because he was too shy when barristan mentions perhaps she jumped out of grief for the man who dishonored her at harrenhal he means ned because he killed her brother
asoiaf,not_removed,evidence for ashara making love to brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,how do we know that lyanna loved rhaegar back
asoiaf,not_removed,i like your choice of fonts
asoiaf,not_removed,thats notany better
asoiaf,not_removed,whoa thats one hell of a chart i never knew few people loved mutually before this
asoiaf,not_removed,wow this post is amazing i love how grrm was so detailed about each characters backstory
asoiaf,not_removed,did cersei really love rhaegar i thought she was a only enamored as a young girl same as sansa used to admire and love knights before she went to kl
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks for this
asoiaf,not_removed,brandon loved beandon
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont believe cat loved brandon but she was betrothed also i assume that is jon connington not arryn
asoiaf,not_removed,wait which jon loved rhaegar
asoiaf,not_removed,whats this brandon ashara business
asoiaf,not_removed,youre forgetting jamie made love to cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,which jon are they talking about here id assume connington given how much he loved rhaegar though i thought platonically
asoiaf,not_removed,so basically the tourney at harrenhal was like a big game of mystery date
asoiaf,not_removed,except the top and the bottom arent connected in anyway
asoiaf,not_removed,did joncon actually love rhaegar or was it more of a bromance
asoiaf,not_removed,if you start with any one person and follow the arrows you either end up with brandon or loop between rhaegar and lianna which are ultimately the source oft all the drama
asoiaf,not_removed,poor jamie
asoiaf,not_removed,i want to know and see more of brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,prety sure rhaegar loved elia but felt getting the tird dragon head was his duty
asoiaf,not_removed,not sure why jon loves rheagar or why rheagar doesnt love ellia brandon loving brandon though spot on
asoiaf,not_removed,jon doesnt need to be on this
asoiaf,not_removed,was lyanna really betrothed to robert i just remember robert wanting her not a betrothal
asoiaf,not_removed,brandonkanye
asoiaf,not_removed,this chart is really great its crazy that out of all those characters the only truly reciprocal relationships in terms of being in love were between lyanna rhaegar and jaime cersi
asoiaf,not_removed,how do we know that though
asoiaf,not_removed,brandon is brandons biggest fan
asoiaf,not_removed,i crie evry tiem
asoiaf,not_removed,barriston was like a year old man at that point surrounded by teenagers
asoiaf,not_removed,depends on who you ask bit yes ned makes the most sense story wise
asoiaf,not_removed,shower thought i strongly despised the frivolous teen attitude of sansa at tournament of the hand in kl but now i see her pov is a perfect mirror of the environment that should had lived in harrenhal tournament and how many people died because of a bunch of fool love affairs
asoiaf,not_removed,i think a similar relationship chart was the basis of the first twilight book as well
asoiaf,not_removed,it hasnt been revealed yet who ashara loved just that she loved a stark i personally think it makes more sense that it was ned rather than brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah this is what ive always thought im not sure where op pulled brandon from
asoiaf,not_removed,shes lacking a sexy time line with her brother and her husband though
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt love a bit too strong she was really young at the tourney wasnt she id guess its more of a crush
asoiaf,not_removed,hes forgetting jamie and cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,i think she subscribed to i love him because im supposed to
asoiaf,not_removed,she did mourn him for years afterwards he was on his way to riverrun when strange how telling it still made her throat grow tight after all these years when he heard about lyanna and went to kings landing instead it was a rash thing to do she remembered how her own father had raged when the news had been brought to riverrun the gallant fool was what he called brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,in the show petr baelish tells his whores about brandon and ned stark a northerner with a jaw like an anvil later he describes ned in comparison to his brother brandon oh no he got himself killed before the wedding and she ended up with his brother an even more impressive specimen
asoiaf,not_removed,never confirmed i always thought that ashara and ned made more sense tbh
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i didnt know this either
asoiaf,not_removed,its another stupid fan theory with zero evidence similar to tywin poisoned the viper and jojen tree paste
asoiaf,not_removed,barristan losing his mind in old age remembers something about his waifu getting with a stark instead of him its open to interpretation
asoiaf,not_removed,it took me so long to teach my four year old niece the amount of legs an m has she just kept on going seeing monster ms still makes me happy
asoiaf,not_removed,it was true love
asoiaf,not_removed,thank you there is nothing at all to suggest anything happened between brandon and ashara this is one of preston jacobs most notorious use of some bullshit leaps of logic and well then as you can see i think something so there is proof and there cannot be any doubt the only thing stated was that ashara danced with ned after brandon danced with her andto talk to her on neds behalf its patently ridiculous to assume this means some sort of brandonfuckedherfirst etc brandon was betrothed to a seemingly beautiful and highborn catelyn and hes neds older brother and the wildchild badass heir to winterfell he was doing what all sorts of best friendsolder brothersfraternity brosfriendsetc have done for their boys for years trying to help hook them up i have been there i have tried to help my boys get with girls by talking to them and talking them up or even saying hes a little too shynervousetc to talk to you or whatever that doesnt mean i give em a test drive and fuck them and then say o btw my boy wants to talk to you come the fuck on and were talking about a notoriously closeknit and honorable group as house stark let alone the wolf pup brothers sister all brandon did was talk to her for ned and there is not a single bit of evidence at all otherwise all there is is pjstyle leaps of logic and bullshit fluffery of opinionsintowellthishappenedbecauseisayitdid edit and btw there is confirmation about ned and ashara i know ser barristan just says the stark but edric dayne himself says he knew ned loved ashara and she killed herself because of losing her love and possibly child possibly and harwin himself says it was common knowledge in winterfell ned and ashara dayne had a fling and fell in love but could not continue their love afterwards because of the situation catleyn herself says she hears ned was ashara daynes babysdaddy so we do have multiple confirmations about ned and ashara we still have nothing at all except a dance and a talk for ned involving brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,i read jon as in jon snow i was very confused for a while there
asoiaf,not_removed,connington lol theres a lot of suspicion that he always thought a little more of rhaegar then just a friend
asoiaf,not_removed,ah its that jon i thought it was aryn
asoiaf,not_removed,they were at harrenhall edit wrong im wrong they are jaime and cersei as that was when jamie was anointed as the youngest ever member of the kingsguard
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah well jaime was sent to kings landing by aerys on the first day of the tournament so there wasnt much time to bang
asoiaf,not_removed,if the gods are good well get this spinoff
asoiaf,not_removed,i would love to see something cover the rebellion be it spinoff graphic novel anything this is probably my favorite moment in westerosi history and seeing the battle of the trident given the hbo treatment would make my damn life
asoiaf,not_removed,this seems more like an assumption it couldve been ned she banged
asoiaf,not_removed,you know what i like about these hand maidens i keep getting older but they stay the same age alright alright alright barristan selmy
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly some of these relationships are questionable especially if youre limiting the timeframe to only the tourney and its funny you mention martins style i mean we all know its not martins style to paint the hero saves maiden from evil rival trope straight aka roberts take on the rebellion since its such an obvious trope but its also not his style to paint the lovers bound by fate run away and elope story straight either aka the rlj fans take on the events because its just as obvious a trope we dont know the full facts yet on either score honestly it wouldnt shock me to see grrm subvert the rlj love story as hard as he subverted roberts noble hero wins a war in the name of love and justice story it just seems like it fits his universe more to have the truth be something in the middle
asoiaf,not_removed,they didnt make azor ahai imo
asoiaf,not_removed,not necessarily at harrenhall though
asoiaf,not_removed,not yet confirmed in the texts right
asoiaf,not_removed,everybody loves rhaegar hes like the westerosi justin trudeau
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah literally everyone and their dog was in love with rhaegar his beauty appealed to men and women alike and he was a fucking bard
asoiaf,not_removed,i always had the feeling that rape was implied
asoiaf,not_removed,connington
asoiaf,not_removed,the sister of arthur dayne
asoiaf,not_removed,one of the big red flags for me was in agot one of danys first chapters died on the trident for the woman that he loved if we agree the first book had the most foreshadowing i feel that was one of the first hints i think he did love her the details are whats messy
asoiaf,not_removed,well she keeps talking how much she wanted him even now as an adult he must be the only person besides jaime that she ever truly wanted maybe even more than jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,jon connington
asoiaf,not_removed,at the tourney
asoiaf,not_removed,jon is joncon
asoiaf,not_removed,its jon connington
asoiaf,not_removed,robert will never keep to one bed lyanna had told him at winterfell on the night long ago when their father had promised her hand to the young lord of storms end i hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the vale ned had held the babe in his arms he could scarcely deny her nor would he lie to his sister but he had assured her that what robert did before their betrothal was of no matter that he was a good man and true who would love her with all his heart lyanna had only smiled love is sweet dearest ned but it cannot change a mans nature eddard ix agot they were almost at the end now and bran felt a sadness creeping over him and theres my grandfather lord rickard who was beheaded by mad king aerys his daughter lyanna and his son brandon are in the tombs beside him not me another brandon my fathers brother theyre not supposed to have statues thats only for the lords and the kings but my father loved them so much he had them done the maids a fair one osha said robert was betrothed to marry her but prince rhaegar carried her off and raped her bran explained robert fought a war to win her back he killed rhaegar on the trident with his hammer but lyanna died and he never got her back at all bran vii agot the greatest lords and mightiest champions of the seven kingdoms rode in that tourney and the prince of dragonstone bested them all but that was the tourney when he crowned lyanna stark as queen of love and beauty said dany princess elia was there his wife and yet my brother gave the crown to the stark girl and later stole her away from her betrothed how could he do that did the dornish woman treat him so ill it is not for such as me to say what might have been in your brothers heart your grace the princess elia was a good and gracious lady though her health was ever delicate daenerys iv asos yet if this were true why did lady lyannas brothers seem so distraught at the honor the prince had bestowed upon her brandon stark the heir to winterfell had to be restrained from confronting rhaegar at what he took as a slight upon his sisters honor for lyanna stark had long been betrothed to robert baratheon lord of storms end eddard stark brandons younger brother and a close friend to lord robert was calmer but no more pleased as for robert baratheon himself some say he laughed at the princes gesture claiming that rhaegar had done no more than pay lyanna her due but those who knew him better say the young lord brooded on the insult and that his heart hardened toward the prince of dragonstone from that day forth twoiaf the fall of the dragons the year of the false spring the battle screamed about lord robert and prince rhaegar both and by the will of the gods or by chance—or perhaps by design—they met amidst the shallows of the ford the two knights fought valiantly upon their destriers according to all accounts for despite his crimes prince rhaegar was no coward lord robert was wounded by the dragon prince in the combat yet in the end baratheons ferocious strength and his thirst to avenge the shame brought upon his stolen betrothed proved the greater his warhammer found its mark and robert drove the spike through rhaegars chest scattering the costly rubies that blazed upon the princes breastplate twoiaf the fall of the dragons roberts rebellion
asoiaf,not_removed,yes
asoiaf,not_removed,i miss the old brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,branye north
asoiaf,not_removed,branye
asoiaf,not_removed,breezy gon breez
asoiaf,not_removed,makes sense
asoiaf,not_removed,branye
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,its still not proven that lyanna loved rhaegar even though i think that was the case plus there is no evidence ashara loved brandon if we stand to the books its more likely she loved ned
asoiaf,not_removed,i question cerseis love for jamie imo i dont think that she could love anyone but the closest she got was rhaegar jamie as much as he loved her was a means to an end for cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,thats not the point if only hed beaten rhaegar if only hed crowned ashara weeping
asoiaf,not_removed,is the evidence to support this in the text or just conjecture
asoiaf,not_removed,we dont know that any of the actions on the political stage had anything to do with fool love affairs beyond roberts obsession with lyanna there was a theory posted some months ago that rhaegar took lyanna to save her from aerys who somehow learned of the northern plot to overthrow him e im trying to find it but im having some trouble if anyone saved it here it is there are parts
asoiaf,not_removed,she couldve loved lyanna asharas suicide does coincide with lyannas death not brandons or neds wedding
asoiaf,not_removed,could you explain why you think it makes more sense that it was ned rather than brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,barristan believed that it was brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,well this is at the time of the tourney so she wasnt married to robert yet she and jaime were definitely already doing the deed at this point though a maid caught them at one point while joanna was still alive and she died when they were seven
asoiaf,not_removed,she didnt get boned by them at the tourney
asoiaf,not_removed,and robert and cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,the same way sansa loved joffrey before she knew him loved the idea of being betrothed to a prince not the prince himself
asoiaf,not_removed,show canon is not book canon brandon in the books is described as a ladykiller while young ned was shy and unassuming
asoiaf,not_removed,how brandon was supposed to be the playboy and ned never even mentions her in his pov except when cersei brings it up and ned ignores it then too her suicide also took place whole years after she and a stark was supposedly a thing
asoiaf,not_removed,muscled like a maidens dream
asoiaf,not_removed,dude did you ever watch a pj video all the way to the end he always says that hes probably wrong he just likes to play pretend a lot
asoiaf,not_removed,same wasnt till i read through these comments i figured out what the deal was
asoiaf,not_removed,seriously didnt know lmao
asoiaf,not_removed,its funny how all the malemale homosexual relationships in asoiaf are hinted at and never outright stated but on the femalefemale side you get stuff like the myrish swamp
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime was raised to the kingsguard at the tournament so the twins were
asoiaf,not_removed,nature finds a way
asoiaf,not_removed,i get a bad taste in my mouth out here valyrian steel dragon glass like you can smell a psychosphere barristan rust selmy
asoiaf,not_removed,could be that lyanna was in love with rhaegar and he took advantage of that for the sake of his prophecy or he simple kidnapped and raped her but i doubt it was that simple either he was really tortured and probably more fucked up than people around him realized all those people idolize him and put him on a pedestal but he probably had something dark deep within him
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah my guess is rhaegar learned of the prophecy then kidnapped and raped lyanna and she gave birth to jon
asoiaf,not_removed,by that measure there shouldnt be any lines connecting rhaegar and lyanna at all then the books never said anything about them loving each other in either direction at the time of the tourney itself all we have is fans head canons and fan speculation on that score no real facts
asoiaf,not_removed,well we know of at least one character who doesnt love him
asoiaf,not_removed,or ray romano
asoiaf,not_removed,shoutout to canada
asoiaf,not_removed,take it easy bobby b
asoiaf,not_removed,wow mind blown totally missed that one
asoiaf,not_removed,dany also says he kidnapped lyanna at swordpoint sooooo
asoiaf,not_removed,please remind me whereabouts this was mentioned
asoiaf,not_removed,thank you that makes sense
asoiaf,not_removed,were five separate quotes really necessary lol
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah the first two wouldve been enough dude
asoiaf,not_removed,straight from the go brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,i even had the stark armor i thought i was brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,straight from the go brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,well its a one way arrow not a two way arrow brandon loved brandon but brandon did not love brandon back
asoiaf,not_removed,thats maybe my favorite the chartcrafter was feeling quite cheeky that day i guess i meant between two people
asoiaf,not_removed,the story of the harrenhall tourney is purposefully vague i agree that we cant be certain of asharas and lyannas affections or even the motives that drove everyone to make and break alliances until we get a timetraveling dunk and egg who visited harrenhall in their future we will never know
asoiaf,not_removed,thank you most folks assume that its a matter of reciprocated love my wife and i hold firmly to the theory that while lyanna maybe fancied rhaegar his affection was likely driven to obsession in attempting to fulfill the prophecy of the prince who was promised and her kidnap could have easily been nonconsensual theres no evidence anywhere that lyanna truly loved either rhaegar or robert just that they both loved her and i do legitimately believe that bobbie b loved her he just also liked to play hide the sausage with bar wenches
asoiaf,not_removed,i also dont buy that rhaegar loved lyanna my interpretation is that he thought she was necessary to fulfil the prophesy he might have loved her but i dont think thats really confirmed and if so its likely it will never be
asoiaf,not_removed,a means to what end being with him could only end badly for her if anyone found out if anything rhaegar seemed more like the means to an end loving him just because he was attractive and would make her queen
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei cersei cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,ned never thinks boy i sure loved ashara or anything but theres a lot of bits of evidence scattered about that point in the direction of either ned or brandon its not really clear who but i lean towards ned
asoiaf,not_removed,all we know is that ned was infatuated with ashara and danced with her at the tourney after brandon talked to her because ned was too shy barristan says stark dishonored ashara at harrenhal but its intentionally left ambiguous as to which stark it was a lot of people like to think it was ned but given what we know about ned honorable to a fault and what we know about brandon he was a bit wild it makes more sense to me that brandon was the stark who dishonored ashara ive never understood everyone thinking ned and ashara were in love she was a beautiful young woman who caught the attention of a shy young man they danced thats all it probably was
asoiaf,not_removed,edric dayne when talking to arya
asoiaf,not_removed,suicide clearly shes traveling under the assumed name lemore you fucking casual
asoiaf,not_removed,it also coincides with learning her lover killed her brother and is taking their baby away so that one works best for me
asoiaf,not_removed,oh wow now i feel like a biggot for never even considering this
asoiaf,not_removed,well rhaegar has cersei and jon connigton lyanna has robert and ashara now to match him
asoiaf,not_removed,then explain the stillborn
asoiaf,not_removed,woah thats really interesting especially considering some of the danny jon baby swap theories
asoiaf,not_removed,benjen was during harrenhal and that dialogue with jon doesnt even remotely imply anything about harrenhal
asoiaf,not_removed,he joined because hes gay
asoiaf,not_removed,yes it seems like something bad had happened to her she turned to stark in her grief its a long time since i read the context but i wonder whether the bad thing was rape or accidental pregnancy in which case any of the starks could have comforted her even lyanna
asoiaf,not_removed,because edric dayne tells arya that his mother asharas sister that ashara loved ned when barristan said he thought stark dishonor ashara more than likely he only saw brandon talking to ashara for ned that he assumed brandon was the one brandon cares for his siblings he helps ned out and was the first to react to lyannas kidnapping ashara didnt suicide after brandon died she killed herself after ned came to starfall because its also less impactful that she killed herself because the brother of her lover killed her brother than her lover breaking her heart and killing her brother
asoiaf,not_removed,because of what barristan said about her also it would be exceedingly cruel that the man she once loved and caused her to lose honor have a still born child kill her brother marry another woman and then show up after the war to return her brothers sword with someone elses baby cruelty is something that martin seems to like quite a bit and also he likes to make us look at heroes despite their flaws and somewhat understand his villains point of view very few things are cut and dry in martins world
asoiaf,not_removed,how the hell can you fuck at
asoiaf,not_removed,to be fair it was bc of his princely title status as heir and that he was supposed to be a good looking kid they told a girl who grew up dreaming of fairy tales that she was set to marry prince charming its like she liked the idea of joffery so she made the connection that she liked joffrey if he was joffery mallister a good not great match she would not of been so all about hom
asoiaf,not_removed,this is true however i mentioned how it happens in the show before i quote the lines this thread is filled with both id like to think the jawline is a reference to how handsome brandon was and the remark about ned is more about size and stature
asoiaf,not_removed,one thing i only really noticed when reading through jons chapter that completely overlaps with sams preparation for leaving for oldtown is that the pov characters actually have multiple levels of thought many of which are simply not shown at all when you compare jons pov and sams you can actually tell that jon is thinking about as much text as is actually written but is just too stressedtiredfocused to actually muse upon it hell jons chapter even has fewer dialogue lines for himself than he does in sams chapter thats how i realized that neds chapters are probably the same to a degree neds constantly stressed and confused for the latter half of his chapters and probably isnt actually poving out everything hes thinking
asoiaf,not_removed,ned also never mentions that lyanna was jons mother in his pov he gets very angry when cat suggests that ashara might have been jons mother ned dayne seems to think that ned and ashara had a thing which woulndt really make any sense if it turned out to be brandon especially given that nobody ever says anything about brandon and ashara
asoiaf,not_removed,i wouldnt just call one of my homies my silver prince and i think george confirmed theres a gay pov but he wouldnt out joncon
asoiaf,not_removed,well thats because renly loras and joncon just dont inspire the same feeling in george who typed the myrish swamp episode onehanded
asoiaf,not_removed,that probably has more to do with george himself and those girl on girl sexual encounters werent relationships they were just one time things
asoiaf,not_removed,because those are pov characters if connington actually found a male character he finds interesting in his chapters im sure wed get similar descriptions
asoiaf,not_removed,even in hetero sex scenes in the series theres generally a lot more description of the womans sexy bits than the mans which reads strangely when its the womans pov
asoiaf,not_removed,damn im a dumbass wtf he was thats right
asoiaf,not_removed,thats been my take as well no way lyanna would have run off like that without telling at least one of her brothers otherwise they might do something crazy worried about her having been kidnapped and all
asoiaf,not_removed,well there had to be something on rhaegars side whatever it is idk because he crowns her the queen of the tourney there
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah littlefinger can never forgive a man who doesnt frequent brothels
asoiaf,not_removed,ser twenty goodman was his sworn enemy
asoiaf,not_removed,i have a little crackpot theory that robert was jealous of lyanna for having rhaegar so he started the war the entire battle was a way to vent the sexual tension between robert and rhaegar
asoiaf,not_removed,welcome to rasoiaf d
asoiaf,not_removed,shit apparently since it was iterated repeatedly and someone still managed to miss it
asoiaf,not_removed,i hate the new brandon hung from a noose brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,ah the true love hate relationship
asoiaf,not_removed,if brandon really loved him he never would have let brandon go to kings landing
asoiaf,not_removed,the man had two hands
asoiaf,not_removed,i think most of it will be cleared by howland reed if we ever get the ending of this saga
asoiaf,not_removed,when i read your description i picture de like rick and morty i dont know why
asoiaf,not_removed,i think ashara needs a big ole pink heart with a question mark in the middle somebody probably got some of that but nobody knows who
asoiaf,not_removed,in the game of hide the sausages we all are losers
asoiaf,not_removed,he might have loved her but i dont think thats really confirmed and if so its likely it will never be i thought the same as well that we will never find out but while i was looking into some old ssms i found george talking about this specific matter interviewer mr martin i was under the impression that rhaegar raped lyanna did he or were they in love grrm rhaegar and lyanna — well thats a revelation that will need to wait for later volumes but if youre uncertain about it i am glad one thing i wanted to do was suggest the uncertainty of truth i mean think about it — in our own world we dont even know what happened between thomas jefferson and sally hemmings — or between bill clinton and paula jones for that matter the truth of rhaegar and lyanna may be similarly elusive for a time this interview is from a long time ago a looooong time ago really old stuff from it seems he was more open to talk about this back then the books werent that famous yet so it makes sense but it seems we will know whatever happened between those two link for the interview
asoiaf,not_removed,i think he provided her with someone to love her unconditionally as she felt rhaegar would have if they had been wed jamie gave her someone she could have complete faith in someone she could cuckold her husband with without it raising eyebrows when the kids looked like him had she taken a redheaded lover a greyeyed lover a silverhaired lover a longfaced stark all could have raised questions in the offspring cersei has also always been the consummate narcissist and screwing jamie is as close as she can get to fucking herself for proof look at how she treats him when her outlived his practical usefulness and she no longer needs a lovercuckold to protect her from robert even he starts getting it and moonboy for all i know
asoiaf,not_removed,well theres simply no evidence that it was brandon theres two direct assertions by by characters edric and catelyn that it was ned everyone says the timeline doesnt work out that way because ned had already gotten catelyn pregnant but catelyn seems to think its plausible unless both of those were red herrings its ned and if they are both red herrings its sort of shitty writing
asoiaf,not_removed,i watched a preston jacobsvideo about the idea that ashara and ned loved eachother i dont know how much evidence theres in it preston can go a little overboard with his theory but i atleast liked the idea of it
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but what about ashara loving ned back
asoiaf,not_removed,ned never even mentions her in his pov brandon makes more sense
asoiaf,not_removed,thats how i see it too
asoiaf,not_removed,well i wouldnt take edric as the paragon of truth considering he also mentioned wylla to be jons mother in the same scene
asoiaf,not_removed,no her name is jyana
asoiaf,not_removed,we rdarksouls now
asoiaf,not_removed,lemore is already uhm daario
asoiaf,not_removed,savagetake my upvote ser
asoiaf,not_removed,ned hadnt been her lover for over almost two years by that time he was long since married to catelyn and they had already had robb by the time ned came to starfall and asharas brother was a kingsguard to the dynasty that had just been dethroned i dont think it was a surprise that he died as well sad of course but not throwmyselfoffatowersad
asoiaf,not_removed,show has pretty much confirmed jon is lyannas not asharas would expect the two to deviate that much unless were talking about a different baby i dont know about
asoiaf,not_removed,id say that brandons death plus the loss of her pregnancy plus she probably told ned where his brother was and felt responsible for his death would make her jump from the tower
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel like a pervert for considering this first
asoiaf,not_removed,i wouldnt call it biggotry to simply not concider the possibility it would have been rude if it was a real person but biggot sounds like a strong word in this context
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its only bigotry if you hate on it after the possibility is mentioned
asoiaf,not_removed,feelings for a woman dont preclude her from sleeping with a man
asoiaf,not_removed,what stillborn
asoiaf,not_removed,twelve years old boy banging
asoiaf,not_removed,nah starks dont have that code writ in their os
asoiaf,not_removed,because edric dayne tells arya that his mother asharas sister that ashara loved ned let me fix that for you the woman is edrics aunt not mother she was betrothed to beric dondarrion the knightlord dayne squired the boy is lord of starfall and son of the last lord that was asharas brother as well
asoiaf,not_removed,but asharas daughter had been stillborn and his fair lady had thrown herself from a tower soon after mad with grief for the child she had lost and perhaps for the man who had dishonored her at harrenhal as well she died never knowing that ser barristan had loved her how could she he was a knight of the kingsguard sworn to celibacy no good could have come from telling her his feelings no good came from silence either if i had unhorsed rhaegar and crowned ashara queen of love and beauty might she have looked to me instead of stark from the quote it seems like hes saying that she was also mad with grief because something happened to the man who dishonored her it also points out that she was infatued with a stark thats after we have the whole history with barbrey dustin about brandon taking the maidenhood of noble women without caring about the consequences also we know that barristan holds a high opinion of ned stark i doubt he would do that if he had dishonored the woman he loved
asoiaf,not_removed,its pretty obvious what looked to means if barristan had won the tourney and crowned ashara queen of love and beauty then perhaps shed have been taken with him rather than im guessing ned
asoiaf,not_removed,they shared a bed they probably were just playing maester
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think they were having sex but they were probably doing the equivalent of playing doctor or touching each other inappropriately
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe jaime mentioned they saw animals hump in the yard and started playing games mirroring that when joanna found them
asoiaf,not_removed,children discover themselves quite young and most will start at least touching themselves somewhere in the range they will typically also masturbate after theyve started touching themselves its not uncommon for them to experiment with others of the same age range though of course they really have no idea what theyre doing other than this feels kind of nice and us adults get rather freaked out by it and dont hand explaining whats appropriate well ending up with a blanket ban on everything
asoiaf,not_removed,ned also never mentions that lyanna was jons mother in his pov thats because grrm doesnt want to spoil rlj in the first book ned also does think about the promises he made to lyanna he gets very angry when cat suggests that ashara might have been jons mother thats because ned loved his sister and cat suggesting ashara as jons mother was insulting to ned on different levels ned also didnt really cheat on cat so he must have teared up inside remember hes only human ned dayne seems to think that ned and ashara had a thing which woulndt really make any sense if it turned out to be brandon especially given that nobody ever says anything about brandon and ashara barriston says that he loved ashara and regrets not telling her that before she slept with a stark brandon was supposed to be the playboy and since barriston thinks so highly of ned its unlikely that ned was the one sleeping around
asoiaf,not_removed,ned never mentions jons lyannas son but he does think of the promises he made to lyanna a lot he is also haunted by the kingsguard he killed to save lyanna there is no mention of ashara at all in his thoughts infact from a plot perspective it would make more sense if grrm took the time to emphasize neds feelings for ashara if he truly had any to misdirect us from rlj i think brandon and ashara make way more sense
asoiaf,not_removed,i think george confirmed theres a gay pov but he wouldnt out joncon here are the sources i could find q is a certain pov character in adwd gay a i cant answer without spoiling but if youre talking about what i think youre talking about then yes okay so one of the new povs i got the sense that he was gay and i was wondering if i am crazy and reading into that or if like that thing was actually a thing that was happening grrm you mean in feast me no i mean in the new one grrm oh in the new one me yeah i finished um im talking about the lost lord sorry sorry trying not to spoil anything ugh grrm if you are talking about what i think youre talking about then youre right when it was time for the signing i had my own book and a copy for isabel i got up there and he leans forward conspiratorially and we have the following exchange grrm seeming a bit excited or tickled or something okay so youre talking about me connington and rhaegar grrm yes but it was unrequited me yeah i got that rae we got that me i just was reading and my silver prince was just not how you talk about a friend i cant access this link but i found these two posts on the westeros forums referencing it
asoiaf,not_removed,he was jealous of elia martel claiming she wasnt worthy of rhaeghar he seems to have had no romantic companion in his years of exile and he remained unmarried into his despite good prospects im pretty sure he loved rhaeghar
asoiaf,not_removed,i wouldnt just call one of my homies my silver prince pfff thats about as gay as the occasional mutual handjob standard hetero friendship if you ask me
asoiaf,not_removed,theres a theory benjen was told but failed to let the rest of the starks know before his father and brandon got themselves killed by aerys this is one of the theories on why benjen took the black guilt
asoiaf,not_removed,to be honest given that it would technically be lord rickards responsibility to look after her and he didnt do anything after rhaegar carried lyanna away it would been perfectly possible that lyanna sent a letter to her father at winterfell with brandom missing out cause he and friends were chilling in the riverlands
asoiaf,not_removed,not a theory thats just an insightful look at what was really going sure the war was about saving lyanna and bringing her back but i think it goes without saying it wasnt all about that for robert bobby b hated rhaegar because deep down he had to know lyanna never loved him and did love rhaegar
asoiaf,not_removed,lol at robert starting the war the dude didnt even fire the second shot that was jon arryn calling his banners let alone the first that was aerys with his bs trial and his calling for robert and neds heads if anything the man was fighting in selfdefense with sides of justice and vengeance thrown in and thats taking the cynical view of it
asoiaf,not_removed,its up to you if you want your father loose brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,the always rude brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,probably but we would still need to rely on another characters interpretation of the event and weve already heard his side of the story from the reeds in brans chapter although he would make it more specific
asoiaf,not_removed,there he is again howland ex machina maybe he deserves his own copypasta
asoiaf,not_removed,egg hey dunk iii think we should stop messing with the whole blackfyre affair dunk dont be stupid egg if we dont burp stop this you will never become uh nevermind forget aburpbout i shouldnt have said this
asoiaf,not_removed,yup all we know is that she was what barristan considers dishonored and that she afterwards turned to stark a lot of people read dishonored as having sex with or being raped by someone but we dont know who it could also be interpreted differently and she sought help from or justice by a stark but which one likely not lyanna or barry wouldnt be jealous but perhaps that interpretation is also slightly off we really have no idea what happened with her i personally like the idea that in the time between aegons birth and lyannas abduction that rhaegar had raped ashara and ashara miscarriedhad a stillborn from him it fits better with the timelines for the time of her suicide and being elias handmaiden she was on hand at kings landing only returning to starfall during the war
asoiaf,not_removed,we all know it was the wild wolf who tapped thay and then he dipped and go
asoiaf,not_removed,well theres the whole forbidding cat to say asharas name in front of him in her pov but personally i lean toward brandon being the one ashara loved though now lyanna is super intriguing because i never considered it before in my mind ashara was just in on the whole toj aftermathplot and shes a respected friend who ned doesnt want dishonored by rumors that they banged and that then she gave away her child
asoiaf,not_removed,he at least knows they share a wet nurse and though he wouldnt be told the truth about jonif the daynes even know they have no reason to lie to him about asharas love interests
asoiaf,not_removed,unless she told ned where his brother was and she felt responsible for his death
asoiaf,not_removed,ned got catelyn pregnant and then left for he war and he had already had to fight his way out of he vale at that point her brother being dead is one in a long list of terrible things shes dealing with ned makes more sense than brandon considering there is absolutely no reference in the books to it being brandon and at least two direct assertions it was ned
asoiaf,not_removed,im holding on for book canon book canon show canon
asoiaf,not_removed,as soon as doran and trystane got unceremoniously and retarded murdered in what is easily the worst writing decision of television history i accepted that the books and show will have to differentiate a great deal more moving forward unless george is just going to write a novelization of the show
asoiaf,not_removed,nice somehow never seen this informationguilt angle before i take it you mean she told ned that her brother was at the toj makes it much more satisfying now i never took much interest in ashara stark cos i hadnt seen evidence to indicate either brother
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel like a deviant for demanding martin writes it so
asoiaf,not_removed,it would make himher heteronormative but not a bigot unless they hated ashara for being gay
asoiaf,not_removed,ahaha i mightve been exaggerating a little but still i do feel bad that i never considered it
asoiaf,not_removed,please refrain from insulting or deliberately upsetting other people in rasoiaf continued behavior of this kind will result in a ban
asoiaf,not_removed,ive slept with a few and im a lesbian it happens a desire to be normal experimentation or just not knowing not that i buy into this theory i always assumed the stark was brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,according to barristan selmy ashara gave birth to stillborn daughter after a man dishonoured her at harrenhal
asoiaf,not_removed,nice full scene
asoiaf,not_removed,jon was during that conversation and lyanna was during harrenhal so benjen was definitely younger than that the first time he got drunk or when he was at harrenhal there is no mention about it being at harrenhal and there is no mention of sex besides ashara dayne was a lady in waiting to elia martell so she is almost guaranteed to be way older than benjen there is no mention of her with anything about benjen it makes no sense that a highly desired lady like ashara would fck with year old
asoiaf,not_removed,coldhands obviously
asoiaf,not_removed,i have no opinion on benjens sexuality but i just wanna say that id hope grrm has the subtlety as an author to not write every gay male character the same
asoiaf,not_removed,when grrm implies a character is gay hes usually not very subtle about it man i really disagree i think its very subtle i had no idea that renly and loras were gay on my first read i mean lets compare grrm to other authors for books movies and tv shows alike who like to make their homosexual characters constantly talk about their sexuality in notsosubtle ways however i also dont think that benjen of blackfish are gay its one thing to be subtle and another entirely to not include any kind of substantial evidence
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe hes more an asexualish gay or maybe homosexuality is frowned upon in the north more than in kings landing and the south
asoiaf,not_removed,wouldnt joining a order of only men fit in to that notion
asoiaf,not_removed,youre right my bad
asoiaf,not_removed,playing maester
asoiaf,not_removed,man i was like
asoiaf,not_removed,there were plenty of rumors that ashara was jons mother its possible that barristan simply believed the rumors
asoiaf,not_removed,i always thought ned remembering the promises he made lyanna was kind of a ptsd thing which wouldnt happen with ashara because he wasnt there when she died other than that he never thinks of it because thats his defence mechanism to trauma him and sansa seem to share that he never thinks on the fact that he may have inadvertently led ashara to commit suicide in the same way that sansa never really considers that her going to cersei may have helped with her fathers arrest they both seem to know internally that it would be pointless to worry about it so they avoid stress by not thinking on it at all
asoiaf,not_removed,how would brandon and ashara romance mean anything to the story
asoiaf,not_removed,dont forget that when haldon suggests that jon offer himself up to secure a marriage alliance to help aegons cause that jon becomes furious and outright refuses it my lord knows best said haldon in that case we might consider offering potential friends a lesser prize what would you suggest you you are unwed a great lord still virile with no heirs except these cousins we have just now dispossessed the scion of an ancient house with a fine stout castle and wide rich lands that will no doubt be restored and perhaps expanded by a grateful king once we have triumphed you have a name as a warrior and as king aegons hand you will speak with his voice and rule this realm in all but name i would think that many an ambitious lord might be eager to wed his daughter to such a man even perhaps the prince of dorne jon conningtons answer was a long cold stare there were times when the halfmaester vexed him almost as much as that dwarf had i think not death is creeping up my arm no man must ever know nor any wife he got back to his feet prepare the letter to prince doran yes he justifies it under the fact that nobody can know about his greyscale but it still pretty clearly imo points to the fact that he doesnt like women hence why hes so angry and doesnt understand why haldon would ever suggest such a thing because haldon doesnt know about the greyscale but he presumably does know jons gay
asoiaf,not_removed,one of the first things he does when they take back griffins roost is lie to the servants that hes going to bed he then sneaks up to a tower and gets lost in a memory of the time rhaegar had visited him its a romantically framed scene where theyre atop the castles tallest tower and jon remembers vividly how rhaegars hair blew in the wind and how he told him that the connington lands were beautiful he also seems to have had a fondness for the old leader of the golden company myles blackheart toyne in the same way when thinking about him he has a warm recollection of his smile
asoiaf,not_removed,he seems to have had no romantic companion in his years of exile i would say that myles toyne was probably his romantic companion his reaction upon seeing toynes golden skull was pretty romantic there on the end flowers pointed wait ill go announce you he slipped inside the tent leaving griff to contemplate the gilded skull of his old friend in life ser myles toyne had been ugly as sin his famous forebear the dark and dashing terrence toyne of whom the singers sang had been so fair of face that even the kings mistress could not resist him but myles had been possessed of jug ears a crooked jaw and the biggest nose that jon connington had ever seen when he smiled at you though none of that mattered blackheart his men had named him for the sigil on his shield myles had loved the name and all it hinted at a captaingeneral should be feared by friend and foe alike he had once confessed if men think me cruel so much the better the truth was otherwise soldier to the bone toyne was fierce but always fair a father to his men and always generous to the exile lord jon connington death had robbed him of his ears his nose and all his warmth the smile remained transformed into a glittering golden grin all the skulls were grinning even bittersteels on the tall pike in the center what does he have to grin about he died defeated and alone a broken man in an alien land on his deathbed ser aegor rivers had famously commanded his men to boil the flesh from his skull dip it in gold and carry it before them when they crossed the sea to retake westeros his successors had followed his example
asoiaf,not_removed,that would be a pretty book oops even for a kid what was it my sister wanted me to do something right she ran off and eloped into a polygamous marriage with the prince better tell brandon wait whered he go then he had quite a bit longer to tell his dad since it would take several weeks for news to travel between kings landing and wherever they were
asoiaf,not_removed,insightful lol the man gets sentenced to die for no reason whatsoever what should he have done cut his own head off and have it delivered to aerys in a box wrapped in a bow and he didnt hate rhaegar because lyanna chose him he hated rhaegar because rhaegar was a sneaking coward who didnt have the balls to face robert for almost two years after he stole away raped his betrothed and ignited a civil war had rhaegar done something like duel robert for lyanna something even littlefinger had enough sack to do re catelyn robert wouldnt have hated him like he did for all those years hell he might have even respected him for it though he still wouldve hated him some for trying to get lyanna robert respects people who come at him straight enemy or not he hates people who sneak around and are dishonest rhaegar didnt come at him straight and the one thing robert hates is an enemy who doesnt come at him straight
asoiaf,not_removed,your nephew will be killed by roose brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,way too late but i appreciate the rhyme
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks mate you gave me a good laugh and i needed it
asoiaf,not_removed,dunk egg i need to just shove these magic seeds waaaaay up your butt burp theyll idunno stop winter or something we just really need them you hear me egg
asoiaf,not_removed,i like the interpretation that it was aerys not rhaegar the only person that has ever said that rhaegar was a rapist was robert and his brothers ned doesnt even say it and neither does barristan so rhaegar raping ashara seems really out of character for him meanwhile we know that aerys loved burning people and that he loved raping rhaella his wife after burning someone ashara at the time was elias handmaiden and elia was kept as a hostage for rhaegars good behavior so i could see aerys burning someone and raping ashara in the aftermath
asoiaf,not_removed,im partial to the theory allyria is actually asharas daugher not her much younger sister preferably by ned but we dont get everything we want
asoiaf,not_removed,this is the thing that never sat right with me for ned ashara he never mentions her even to himself even in his fever dreams surely if they were in love hed have thought about her at some point
asoiaf,not_removed,so the child that was given away theoried to be same baby at tower of joy therefore no rlj or a different kid
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah we dont really know how ned tracked lyanna down ashara giving the location and saying please dont kill my brother would make sense she mightve thought that ned could end it peacefully the way he had at storms end after all its ned not brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,except brandon was a hotty tall and handsome excellent swordsman and jouster bad boy that could not be tamed a wild wolf who took whatever he wanted theon adwd barristan has no animosity towards ned as we can see when he defends him in front of daenerys but he said to himself that if he won harrenhall ashara would have turned to him instead of a stark which to me is a pretty good clue that it was not ned as he knew ned personally and respected him and would probably used first name instead of a house name also the thing of brandon asking her to dance with ned is also a potential clue as usually confidence is attractive therefore she wouldnt feel attracted to ned who didnt have the courage to ask her to dance himself
asoiaf,not_removed,the big reveal of the mystery of jons parentage would make zero sense if it was ashara you dont introduce a big mystery in book one and then have it result in nothing important thatd be like dany dying in mereen and young griff actually being the true targaryen that reclaims westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,its not book canon its book gossip
asoiaf,not_removed,it makes sense that ashara told him where to find his brother as far as we know he ignored the location of lyanna after he left kings landing and all the other people that knew were dead we also know that ned stark gave them several chances to surrender and keep their honor unblemished but they refused to do so
asoiaf,not_removed,you hadnt seen evidence catelyn straight up said it and edric dayne heavily implied it
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel like im interrupting something just being here
asoiaf,not_removed,that was my point
asoiaf,not_removed,hearsay guys remember that
asoiaf,not_removed,my point was that was what barristan thought we dont definitely know that ashara was ever actually pregnant
asoiaf,not_removed,dont forget cersei says ashara was pregnant too honor she spat how dare you play the noble lord with me what do you take me for youve a bastard of your own ive seen him who was the mother i wonder some dornish peasant you raped while her holdfast burned a whore or was it the grieving sister the lady ashara she threw herself into the sea im told why was that for the brother you slew or the child you stole tell me my honorable lord eddard how are you any different from robert or me or jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,we need to track benjen down and give him his luckiest boy in westerosmedal right away
asoiaf,not_removed,unless coldhands is benjen dammit dd
asoiaf,not_removed,rainbow guard
asoiaf,not_removed,i didnt realize xaro was gay at first
asoiaf,not_removed,just because its not spelled out for you doesnt mean its not apparent he thinks she would have fucked him or been infatuated with him looked to is a common idiom and theres so much textual evidence to suggest bed and ashara were in love i mean ned daynes aunt allyria even says they fell in love at the tourney
asoiaf,not_removed,ageggity
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean some people do just come into it late though considering the discovery of parts phase tends to kick in around and most parents do a never touch yourself billy oh god freak out its entirely likely that you did and just dont remember long term memory storage only really kicks in around though some memories formstore earlier
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know i cant see ned as a person who wouldnt spare a second thought to a woman he loved who killed herself after giving birth to their stillborn babe i cant see him at all as a person who would simply screw with her at a tourney that seems more brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,ned and asharas romance doesnt do anything to the story either other than make ned look like a douchebag the ned we know would at least spare a thought to a woman who gave birth to his stillborn child he would give at least a thought to a woman who was driven to suicide by his actions
asoiaf,not_removed,benjen was right at the age where something like that could happen hes too young to be considered a responsible adult but old enough to be trusted by a sister that was close to him secretly sparring together in the godswood flashback he was smack dab in the middle of what was going on at harrenhal with the squires picking on howland he was put in a position where he ended up being unsure of what to do and messed up think about yourself at years of age then put yourself in a world without phones and cars benjen taking the black because its considered an honorable calling by the starks makes sense if he was still the third oldest son but he takes the black after brandon is dead at a time when he is neds only backup something more than honor drove him to the wall
asoiaf,not_removed,rhaegar had to choose brandon your sister had the blues brandon other than to life and you land whatchu got to lose brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,not on this sub too much anymore passed through and i always make time for kanye loves kanye haha
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe thats why howland saved his life ned didnt want to kill dayne
asoiaf,not_removed,i always wondered how the hell ned found her this makes a ton of sensei feel silly for not putting the pieces together myself
asoiaf,not_removed,this all sounds like fandom shipping to me barristan didnt really know ned he wasnt friends with ned so he didnt call him by his first name ashara got hit on plenty by strong handsome men if thats all it took to get he rin bed then half the kingsguard would have banged her and oberyn who she also danced with and robert maybe quiet ned stark was more her type
asoiaf,not_removed,chekhovs bastard
asoiaf,not_removed,but its gossip that soon will be confirmed show might be canon but its shit canon fight me p
asoiaf,not_removed,i should have been more clear i thought that cats suspicions were based on the fact that ned just fancied ashara and i totally believed rl so didnt think that jon was her kid anyway that just left two sayso accounts edric for ned and barriston for brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel like i dont belong here but i really like the books so i want to be included
asoiaf,not_removed,oh i know i was just agreeing and adding
asoiaf,not_removed,good catch
asoiaf,not_removed,what are the bi hints for jon never heard that before
asoiaf,not_removed,haha yeah i knew that renly was flamboyant but of course that doesnt equal gay but in hindsight it is a pretty obvious nod to todays lgbt community
asoiaf,not_removed,almost forgot about him he could also be simply asexual though
asoiaf,not_removed,this is getting too obtuse brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,ooh this thread is so good but so sad
asoiaf,not_removed,about fandom i really like ned i really dont like brandon but unfortunately brandon just fits the narrative more than ned i would be much more happier if it was ned but this goes against my inner instincts about is which is derived from the way grrm writes barristan knew ned as an honorable man as he showed no ill will towards him and showed disapproval that dany was equating starks with lannisters and he did refer to him as eddard stark when talking to dany not a stark yes ashara got hit on plenty but barristan did reference a single stark so we can cut it down to either ned and brandon based on this and the fact of brandon asking ashara for ned to dance and i would even add though this is mostly assumption on my part based on what we know of ned he wouldnt dishonor ashara by bedding her before marriage while we have proof that brandon would therefore i would say there is at least a realistic chance it was brandon if not even higher probability that it was b instead of n
asoiaf,not_removed,im not holding for showcanon just pointing out that hearsay and gossip are not to be considered canon only because part of the books or we should believe bran and rickon have been burned by theon and so on book gossip wants jon as ashara and neds son and its confirmed by quite a few independent characters but books also have hints of jon being lyanna and rhaegars all over
asoiaf,not_removed,barristan isnt for brandon though hes at best just ambiguous and with catelyn and edric it isnt just their own say so accounts its all the people around hem gossiping about it or in edrics case straight up telling him its true i mean i guess i can see where you feel barristan opens the door for ambiguity i guess i just think its a huge leap to make with no other supporting evidence for brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel really tired i worked all night and now im off to bed
asoiaf,not_removed,one of us one of us
asoiaf,not_removed,if you like the books then you belong here
asoiaf,not_removed,ya qarth is weird
asoiaf,not_removed,see i invented brandon it wasnt any brandons now i look around and theres so many brandons
asoiaf,not_removed,the whole point of this is that it doesnt fit the narrative because there is literally zero textual evidence that it happened we also have no reason to believe brandon would encourage ned to go dance with his crush and then fuck her later thats a tremendously shitty thing for a brother to do and we have no reason to believe brandon was a piece of human garbage
asoiaf,not_removed,i know and i also believe that lrj i have just lost all faith in the show now and really dislike the execution of it in the show so i want it to be confirmed in a satisfying way in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i didnt reason it out thoroughly
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel nothing
asoiaf,not_removed,ahaha thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,the whole point of this is that it doesnt fit the narrative because there is literally zero textual evidence that it happened if this was a writer to be taken at face value than i would agree but this is grrm were talking about he writes in hints and clues there are little accounts about ashara dayne imagine if in one of those it was clearly stated it was possibly brandon it wouldnt be much of a secret or a reveal to us the readers that it was him and we already had stuff happen that had zero textual evidence but was hinted through clues the only thing we can be sure about is that ned danced with ashara thats it everything else is hearsay equivalently valid as ned bedding wylla i would take barristans account as the most accurate one as he was at the tourney and in love with her the problem is that barristan thinks that stark dishonored her at the tourney and this doesnt fit ned as we can see from his conversation with robert but it does fit brandon as we can see from lady dustin that he had no problem of dishonoring young nobles women from the way grrm writes and barristans accounts there is a chance it was brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,clues are textual evidence
asoiaf,not_removed,i think altshiftx is a bit more accurate with what he puts in his videos theres times where preston is just kinda wrong about things that happened or he remembers them incorrectly i dont watch anyone else so thats as far as it goes
asoiaf,not_removed,only preston jacobs actually makes theories altshiftx just summarizes what popular boards say
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think any of the youtube commenters have been going at t long enogh to be proven right or wrong by the books
asoiaf,not_removed,elio and linda rawrist and tony teflon smokescreen is a fairly recent addition but seems legit
asoiaf,not_removed,adwd came out five years ago so we dont really have much new canonical information since they started making videos
asoiaf,not_removed,elio and linda obviously
asoiaf,not_removed,teflon tv
asoiaf,not_removed,accept preston jacobs theories are mostly complete bs although it is quite entertaining
asoiaf,not_removed,except and while they very well could be complete bullshit he supports his theories with plenty of citation and thats all you can really ask of him
asoiaf,not_removed,dont get me wrong i love his videos some of the things he comes out with are a bit laughable though for example he is convinced that in the books dany can telepathically control fire
asoiaf,not_removed,i accept that his theories are mostly bs
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty sure gendry and mya stone are the only baratheons left and uh you will see what happens to storms end soon
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe some estermont though legitimizing bastards wouldnt be out of the question assuming there is actually a king to do so in the books aegon may grant it to someone and in the show the dornish might invade some theories actually have cerseijaime as the next baratheon heir based on some distant ancestor in truth the answer is quite simple—κρατίστῳ
asoiaf,not_removed,after tommen if she werent an enemy itd probably be dany since shes really the only one left with claim on the iron throne but she is an exiled enemy of the state thatd still be held by her enemies she wouldnt be inheriting that half to find some distant relations some dynasty who were married to targaeryens at some point or a few have some kind of council pick a new leader could even be someone without targaeryen blood in the books we get shown that tywin could have potentially been king after the sack dragonstonestormlands probably revert back to the king for the kings judgement like in the books we get with lady whichever the one ramsay marries for the castle and then looks her in tower where originally she had no heir and what was going to happen to her lands came down to robbs decision legitimizing a bastard putting a distant relation in im sure if he were more power hungry or had a claim he could take it for himself
asoiaf,not_removed,is mya stone acknowledged i sort of remember from the books she doesnt seem to know who her father is you miss edric too whose the only acknowledge bastard robert has so the only one who actually has a chance i guess show gendry knows who his father is but nobody else does
asoiaf,not_removed,i know the golden company maybe dany will in the show plans on taking the abandoned stormlands in the books but who do they rightfully belong to
asoiaf,not_removed,oh shit i forgot about edric hes in lys though whoring it up
asoiaf,not_removed,he storm lands in the books are not abandoned and neither is storms end there isnt too much of a force there though i feel like it goes to tommen until he is proven a bastard or has a child if im not mistaken let the succession debates commence
asoiaf,not_removed,not abandoned but there are no high lords
asoiaf,not_removed,hi sorry ive removed this post please consider posting to the
asoiaf,not_removed,my understanding was all the seats are just seats jon cersei and dany will be sitting in some the beginning of season jon in the great hall of winterfell cersei on the iron throne in kings landing my guess would be danys is just some throne or seat in dragonstone which is really her houses ancestral seat in westeros given to stannis after roberts rebellion
asoiaf,not_removed,its at dragonstone we decided it earlier by a vote of about against halfwits who swore it was the seastone chair we never saw stannis sit on it because the mannis never wasted time sitting
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the mannis prob had hemmoroids based on all his scowls grumpiness and the fact he never sat that throne it all makes sense now this is my first fan theory btw thank you bows
asoiaf,not_removed,well if he did have to sit he made sure to do it beside the painted table where he could continue planning his moves
asoiaf,not_removed,rasoiaf isnt the right place for stuff like this im removing this post
asoiaf,not_removed,moderate a pretty large internet forum dedicated to dissecting any potentially relevant detail we might find in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,jerk it

asoiaf,not_removed,i hope i dont get penalize for saying this in this sub honestly i move on when the show isnt in season i unsubscribe stop thinking about it entirely dont bother with theories or podcasts its just exhausting to get so wrapped up in it its better for me to just completely detach myself from it
asoiaf,not_removed,have other hobbiesinterests than asoiaf

asoiaf,not_removed,try hunter x hunter
asoiaf,not_removed,actraiser is an amazing game definitely underappreciated
asoiaf,not_removed,will do thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,nah read a good manga
asoiaf,not_removed,the golden company are getting lands and riches and a chance to return home as nobles one targaryen pretender is offering this the other has not dany has been in the east and shown no interest to outsiders of returning home as she and her dragons have taken cities thousands of miles away from the free cities she has shown no need for the golden company while she would have her own men and sellswords who she will show her favour to their position with aegon as his main army is superior to that of them turning up to dany and asking if she is going to westeros and can they tag along and be given lands when her dragons and unsullied do the majority of the work and of course they are also influenced with how weak westeros currently is right now is the best time to strike strickland shook his head stubbornly the risk— —is not what it was now that tywin lannister is dead the seven kingdoms will never be more ripe for conquest another boy king sits the iron throne this one even younger than the last and rebels are thick upon the ground as autumn leaves delaying for a few years and hoping that dany will offer them the same terms that ilyrio and aegon do is pretty stupid
asoiaf,not_removed,the open secret concept is surely possibleplausible i assumed it was sort of like the briefings a new president gets when becoming president of the usa maybe even above and beyond that toyne knew he was dying right so he might have went to the guy who was in the forefront most likely to win and say listen this needs to be said i need to bring you up to speed on some things or there could be something similar to the british government letters of last resort on uk nuclear missile subs basically each time a new pm takes power they issue sets of letters for the boomer subs they are sealed and locked in a safe never to be touched unless the very specific set of circumstances which are gone through that seem to prove the uk no longer existshas been hit by a nuclear strike are met then the safe is cracked the letter is pulled and opened it has a set of generally accepted options the pm can issue as orders of last resort ie if the uk has been hit by a nuclear strike and no longer exists or severely compromised you are ordered to do anything from just chill in the sea some more to immediately fire a countersalvo to contact friendlyamerican forces and ask whats up to finding nato forces and placing yourself under the command of natoamerican forcesetc you can read all about them yourself not necessarily the most important thing in this post what i mean to say is its possible there are letters to the new captaingeneral that are written by each cg to be opened by the next upon his death or perhaps there is a secret playbook each incoming gc gets to read only upon becoming the gc stuff like that
asoiaf,not_removed,probably for a couple like franklin flowers and the bastard of darry its about revenge of sorts for the others who wouldnt want to be a fat lord with people waiting on them instead of sell swords fighting other peoples wars
asoiaf,not_removed,the gc in my opinion is the main clue that aegon is a blackfyre if the golden company really just wanted to go home then why didnt they support robert during his rebellion against the targaryens he hated targaryens they hate targaryens it would have been a perfect match since the gc has been in essos for a long time the highest ranking officers probably have some idea of who is descended from the black dragon especially is aegon is descended from bittersteel and calla i think the main contingent doesnt know as that would be very risky but miles toyne almost definitely would have known aegon was a black dragon
asoiaf,not_removed,it is noteworthy that the golden company is very rich they charge a premium for their services and deliver accordingly they could buy titles in essos but they do not they are holding on to a dream of westeros there is an under current of desperation with the golden company they are tired they are tired of being exiles and tired of being homeless each of their invasions had a low probability of success the golden company has participated in at least blackfyre invasions none of these had a high chance of success but the golden company participated anyway the desperation explains why they double down on failure this forth invasion was as lame as the others highly disciplined men could not even withstand the tyrells alone the reach can muster the sole reason for their success is the disorganization of the royal response due to the ironborn raiding and cersei madness
asoiaf,not_removed,the gc is the most professional fighting force outside of the unsullied they commanders order they do only the commanders need know about aegon
asoiaf,not_removed,because the years gap didnt work so he had to invent faegon
asoiaf,not_removed,and of course they are also influenced with how weak westeros currently is exactly when viserys was pitching them for their support westeros was more or less united behind robert and at full strength militarily when aegon comes to them the continent is hugely divided with a couple regions militarily devastated several more in either open rebellion iron islands or passively avoiding any offer of support to the crown dorne the vale and even the winning side of the lannisterstyrells have taken some severe hits in terms of fighting strength
asoiaf,not_removed,good points i appreciate the response i guess my confusion lies in the amount of faith they seem to place in illyrio to give them what they want in terms of a return to westeros where they are lordedlandedfavored and why they didnt ally with dany sooner like years sooner before aegon was in the picture they didnt even know aegon existed as a possibility and they still waited for him the reveal is crazy late in the game considering their preexisting commitment tofaith in illyrio i get once hes revealed why they go with him but what is going on in their heads until that moment on the rhoyne when strickland tells them about aegon lets go to dany now that its clearer than ever shes not going to westeros hmm i wonder why we didnt try to ingratiate ourselves with her at the actual beginning of her power since she is our only hope of returning to westeros we sure were complacent to assume we could meet her as she headed west while giving her no indication we were even supporting her oh well i guess strickland knows best
asoiaf,not_removed,cool realworld examples yeah a last resort briefing makes sense and the contents could have either been we got a blackfyre plan trust us its awesome or weve got a targaryan plan its not that awesome and relies strangely on only available targs
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i totally agree fwiw the gc actions just dont mesh until you consider the blackfyre angle
asoiaf,not_removed,they could buy titles in essos but they do not they are holding on to a dream of westeros very good point and love your analysis of the invasion agreed pretty lame
asoiaf,not_removed,and why they didnt ally with dany sooner like years sooner before aegon was in the picture because there was no offer and westeros was strong viserys we can ignore dany until her dragons were adults a recent development that is still mostly rumour to most of the world was in no position to take retake westeros he did not have the support the golden company turning up with viserys would have got massacred by robert and by tywin and the tyrells
asoiaf,not_removed,tyvm looool at the blackfyre plan trust us its awesome weve got a targ plan not that awesome not that targy but sorta awesome lol
asoiaf,not_removed,i find them to be a rather sad group holding on to a dream of home and disappointed each time they are so jorahlike in a multigenerational sort of way they are certainly competent and rich enough to make new lives but they will not they hold on and follow one bad plan after the next illyrio to tyrion to jon connington daenerys will give the exiles what bittersteel and the blackfyres never could she will take them home homeless harry to connington we came to raise up a king and queen who would lead us home to westeros but this targaryen girl seems more intent on planting olive trees than in reclaiming her fathers throne however with invasions you only need to succeed once
asoiaf,not_removed,i shouldve been clearer i understand why they didnt ally with her or viserys predragons but the seemingly casual way theyve gone about expressing their support for her postdragon is odd to me theres this window between dany getting dragons and aegon revealing himself of course it can be explained by grrms later addition of aegons plot or inuniverse it could be totally insignificant just a consequence of how slowly news and plans travel great distances
asoiaf,not_removed,essos is dangerous setting up outside the free cities would mean fighting dothraki setting up inside the free cities is dangerous too they wouldnt be a fighting force anymore and would be vulnerable to political machinations of older established families the feudal power structure is extremely unwelcome to newcomers who arent replacing someone
asoiaf,not_removed,do you think the best fighters in essos that is why they get the best price do not know this the golden company have faced the best and are acknowledged the best these are men not to be fucked with they have the men and muscle to do as they please
asoiaf,not_removed,and thats why they remain with the golden company none of those mercenaries are stupid enough to think that their pampered unconnected sons would have a chance in pentos as a fighting force on war of their choosing can touch them
asoiaf,not_removed,this was a good read and got me thinking about aragorn didnt he live too for an incredibly long time after the end of the books he still dies but at an incredibly old age he says hes something like or in two towers arwen having to deal with his death always saddened me
asoiaf,not_removed,nice ideas if he were to head to the sunset sea it would only be on the back of a dragon most found it odd that arya mentioned the sunset sea randomly last season curious idea to drop in there by the writers
asoiaf,not_removed,i certainly see the parallels you present with jon and frodo oh and dont forget they both have a sam d it kinda seems like the time when samwell leaves for the citadel is when frodo is losing himself during their travels to mt doom so it might be that jon turns to the dark side only to have sam save him maybe lose a limb in the process i dont think he will run off though i expect he will meet a glorious demise before the end of all things
asoiaf,not_removed,he seems different in the show to me
asoiaf,not_removed,it is the pages or so about the shire that grrm talks about and how it impacted him not frodo have you read the book if not i would recommend it i was annoyed with the entire shire arc mostly because i didnt want to read more pages it didnt even impact me the first time i read it but then when you read it a second time knowing the ending the description of the shire at the beginning of the book and then what happened to it towards the end suddenly hits you
asoiaf,not_removed,i think aragorn lived so long because of being a decedent of numenor did his life extend any because of being with arwen i cant remember
asoiaf,not_removed,dies like age or something i havent read the annals in several years though
asoiaf,not_removed,i was thinking the same why would she randomly ask the question unless it was important to the storyline
asoiaf,not_removed,i think it might be a bit of both the numenoreans had very long lifespans initially up to over years but as they became estranged from the elves their lifespans diminished to the point where the people of gondor who are descendants of ordinary numenoreans had just the same lifespans as other humans isildurs descendants maintained a close relation to the elves of rivendell and they kept somewhat extended lifespans as long as they died a natural death arathorn for example died young from an orc attack
asoiaf,not_removed,actually both fellowship and the silmarillion say that mortals shouldnt live with the immortals for too long the silm straight up says theyll burn up and die faster and were you so to voyage that escaping all deceits and snares you came indeed to aman the blessed realm little would it profit you for it is not the land of manwe that makes its people deathless but the deathless that dwell therein have hallowed the land and there you would but wither and grow weary the sooner as moths in a light too strong and steadfast akallabeth page in fellowship theres a conversation about how mortals can lose all track of time when theyre hanging out with elves in this case the fellowship when they were in lothlorien but time goes on like before you just dont notice the numenoreans were granted longer lives than other men for their service back in the first age and the royal line had an even more extreme version of this gift because they have both elvish and maiar blood they also get helpful visions healing powers and possibly animalspeech skills if you believe the breelanders the northern dunedain have more of this than the south basically because theyve been in hiding for centuries and havent interbred with anyone else aragorns parents arathorn and gilraen were distant cousins both descending from the royal line of arnor the south married mountain men southrons back when gondor was a lot bigger and the northmen of rhovanion so most of them are of mixed blood and dont look like or live as long as the earlier dunedain the line of dol amroth prince imrahil and his sister boromir and faramirs mother is a rare exception because they have elvish blood so they have some of the same gifts aragorn lived to be and faramir so that was one of the perks
asoiaf,not_removed,an old man talking about cunts and swamps and fat pink masts so basically the hottest thing ever
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrions scenes with shae makes me cringe jon and ygritte in the cave was pretty hot though
asoiaf,not_removed,awesome her cunt became the world second only to his war horns aaaaarroooooone of these days im gonna sit down and make a nice text notification of dotrices war horn
asoiaf,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqmkhgqwcjgy
asoiaf,not_removed,id enjoy the scene were daario puts it in danys butt
asoiaf,not_removed,it actually becomes even more uncomfortable when you also factor in the author who wrote it
asoiaf,not_removed,aaaaaaaaarroooooooooo aaaaaaaaarroooooooooo aaaaaaaaarroooooooooo
asoiaf,not_removed,agree ive always felt lb was a dragon drogon in particular one sword isnt very effective compared to a dragon its not as obvious yet theres so many hidden comparisons like making its own heat the way drogon killed that master with the eyes bit and also you could say drogon was forged in drogos heart dany places his egg right next to drogos heart in the pyre similar to how lb was forged in nissa nissas heart
asoiaf,not_removed,this is surprisingly plausible i admit i clicked into this thinking to myself omg another lightbringer theory lets see how bad it is and was surprised that the further i read the more i could accept your citations and see that its viable i even read it aloud to my boyfriend hes a shownly but i give him lots of book info and he says could be especially if we consider drogo to be nissa nissa and the eggs to be the attempts with her mount drogon being the successful forging of magicweaponry for her to wield very sound thanks for the read
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed i forgot the moon stuff thats interesting when the red star bleeds and shadows gather azor ahai will be born again amidst salt and smoke to wake dragons from stone thats the prophecy guess what prophecy complete it says nothing about lightbringer anyway thats from the azor ahai myth about the long night nothing to do with reborn prophecy
asoiaf,not_removed,you totally ignored the fact that he made his blade three times you ignored the fact that his two first blade shattered when finished them you ignored nissa nissa
asoiaf,not_removed,cracking soundmoon crack and the smoke is whirling around dany seems has connection with smoking sword and attempt to forge and was successful for third attempt dunno about it she heard a crack the sound of shattering stone the platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself bits of burning wood slid down at her and dany was showered with ash and cinders and something else came crashing down bouncing and rolling to land at her feet a chunk of curved rock pale and veined with gold broken and smoking the roaring filled the world yet dimly through the firefall dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder only death can pay for life and there came a second crack loud and sharp as thunder and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts she heard the screams of frightened horses and the voices of the dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror and ser jorah calling her name and cursing no she wanted to shout to him no my good knight do not fear for me the fire is mine i am daenerys stormborn daughter of dragons bride of dragons mother of dragons dont you see dont you see with a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky the pyre collapsed and came down around her unafraid dany stepped forward into the firestorm calling to her children the third crack was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world last one when stepped in fire she was successful was it dragons or just drogon
asoiaf,not_removed,there is another version with sword one mentions flame sword and one mentions dragons there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world in this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword and that sword shall be lightbringer the red sword of heroes and he who clasps it shall be azor ahai come again and the darkness shall flee before him behold a sign was promised and now a sign is seen behold lightbringer azor ahai has come again all hail the warrior of fire all hail the son of fire stannis baratheon is azor ahai come again the warrior of fire in him the prophecies are fulfilled the red comet blazed across the sky to herald his coming and he bears lightbringer the red sword of heroes
asoiaf,not_removed,does anyone have to do same as previous one if you want to be literal then she had sacrifice and heart burning thing too attempt to hatch and was successful with last one funeral pyre dont want to wake the dragon she could feel the heat inside her a terrible burning in her womb her son was tall and proud with drogos copper skin and her own silvergold hair violet eyes shaped like almonds and he smiled for her and began to lift his hand toward hers but when he opened his mouth the fire poured out she saw his heart burning through his chest and in an instant he was gone consumed like a moth by a candle turned to ash she wept for her child the promise of a sweet mouth on her breast but her tears turned to steam as they touched her skin want to wake the dragon ghosts lined the hallway dressed in the faded raiment of kings in their hands were swords of pale fire they had hair of silver and hair of gold and hair of platinum white and their eyes were opal and amethyst tourmaline and jade faster they cried faster faster she raced her feet melting the stone wherever they touched faster the ghosts cried as one and she screamed and threw herself forward a great knife of pain ripped down her back and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the shadow of wings and daenerys targaryen flew
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i agree the shattering of the eggs i think is very similar to the shattering of the previous lb attempts viserions egg shatters first then its rhaegal presumably and finally drogon
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought this was interesting at the time but didnt really see others bringing it up i dont think hes said anything further about this issue or what role it was but his names come up in other threads related to rhaegar so i thought it would be interesting to share and its also interesting that he can actually sing as a result of primarily being a singer i guess lol if it was anyone else id say hes too old but jared leto doesnt seem to age really and rhaegar for the show could be closer to his since everyones older than they are in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,you know it was a joke right he was referencing his long beard and how all got men have magnificent beards like his
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean by that point the tyrell and martell fleets have joined dany and she is on the open sea so it is likely that the dothraki have been sailing for months
asoiaf,not_removed,or maybe its because itd be an incredibly stupid artistic decision to have this moment of impending conquest and victory for dany be spoiled by dothraki puking all over themselves ffs
asoiaf,not_removed,if you want an example of dd poking fun at themselves or rather bryan cogman look at the play i cant remember the lines right now but they made some funny comments also the dorne scene in episode with olenna telling the sand snakes
asoiaf,not_removed,and they likely had months between arriving at meereen and departing for westeros plenty of time to condition them to being out on the water and its not like they were the crew on the boats they were only the passengers
asoiaf,not_removed,there are also the physical traits and fitness of each dragon to take into account a nimbler and smaller one would most likely be faster than a colossal one at its peak like balerion
asoiaf,not_removed,also means she can only be choked if shes naked
asoiaf,not_removed,the show runners may have implied that but in the show there was no mention of that part of the prophecy unless when they showed young cersei with maggy in it was only half of it and maybe will continue the second half of it mentioning the valonqar this coming season
asoiaf,not_removed,neck spikes cant stop golden hands
asoiaf,not_removed,that leo dude would be fuming if he saw this
asoiaf,not_removed,i asked in the trailer thread before am i the only one who sees what looks like icy spikes extruding from her neck when she exhaled on top of the ones already present
asoiaf,not_removed,also works as mockery to the queen of thorns
asoiaf,not_removed,wow you guys have a lot more faith in the show than is reasonable i do
asoiaf,not_removed,anyone have a link to an image of this
asoiaf,not_removed,that would be interesting honestly i was disappointed they didnt go further with the maggys maegis prophecy in show i had expected it to reveal there was more to the scene maybe reflect a few more moments in her life confirming the prophecy as far as show i just think its there to make her look cool or its part of her dominatrix outfit idk always hope for books i suppose
asoiaf,not_removed,harder jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,a rear naked choke
asoiaf,not_removed,you dont need the valonqar part of the prophecy to think jaime could kill cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,the scene with the prophecy was shown from beginning to completion for the show though there isnt a spot to splice in something new into that scene if i were strictly a show watcher id feel pretty insulted at having suddenly a deux ex machina type of flashback with additional stuff thrown in that basically goes wait heres a piece we didnt remember the first time about this prophecy we already showed the entirety of just to have it pay off in her death the show will handle it a different way maybe maggy is still around and she has her killed and maggy spouts off a little bit more prophecy as she dies or something
asoiaf,not_removed,uwarlockami
asoiaf,not_removed,just went back and checked and its just the light reflecting off the spikes
asoiaf,not_removed,and ned stark
asoiaf,not_removed,if there is any place to have faith in the show its in the costuming some of those pieces are stunning sansas wedding dress when she married tyrion comes to mind
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,front naked would be preferred tbh
asoiaf,not_removed,she hip escapes and sets up a golden armbar
asoiaf,not_removed,thats true but without the valonqar part of the prophecy the whole neck armor isnt going to make any sense to show only people so if protection from the valonqar wrapping his hands about her pale white throat is indeed what the neck armor is for then its only going to make sense to book readers
asoiaf,not_removed,jamies show character arc is way different he is still madly in love with cersei unlike book jamie who cant stop picturing her fucking moonboy unless he really blames her for the death of tommen which considering myrcella died on his watch would be pretty hypocritical i dont see him hating her enough to kill her
asoiaf,not_removed,if cerseis inner monologue is anything to go by the valonqar theory actually somewhat blinds you to the likelihood of jaime killing cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,except if you read the valonqar prophecy it can only be tommen cersei asks about the king and hers children and maggy responds only about the king and hers children all prophecies work like that its similar to a genie granting a wish but not what you expect because they are exact cersei is just a complete fool which is why she believes its tyrion when it literally cant because she didnt understand maggy cersei is so much of a fool that maggy is not even the persons real name she just couldnt pronounce maege also for the quote cersei will the king and i have children maggy oh aye sixandten for him and three for you gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds she said and when your tears have drowned you the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you really read the interaction and only tommen can be the valonqar maggy only answers about her question what reason does maggy have to randomly jump from her children to her little brothers also she doesnt say your valonqar or a valonqar she says the valonqar this sentence doesnt make sense unless there is only one person who can be the valonqar she has two younger brothers how can only one of them be the little brother
asoiaf,not_removed,sure they look pretty i just meant the thematic significance of small details i could be wrong and they put a lot of thought into stuff like that but in that case i just wish theyd put as much thought into the writing as well theres just no winning with book snobs like me
asoiaf,not_removed,valonqar comes then kills cercei
asoiaf,not_removed,speak for yourself
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe its just in there for us a lot of the costuming pulls inspiration from the books believe it or not dd read the books too
asoiaf,not_removed,they might have another flashback with more parts of the prophecy being revealed i mean they do try to spoon feed the viewers sometimes so season was were they showed all her kids die and that prophecy part now season they might show the rest because that part of the prophecy has to come true
asoiaf,not_removed,i think you missed the significance of the final scenes of the season it is clear that cersei and jamie are definitely at odds now
asoiaf,not_removed,considering she got her son killed and blew up half the city and considering the look he gave her at the end of season i think the madly in love bit is done
asoiaf,not_removed,he is still madly in love with cersei we have no idea what jaimes thoughts are on cersei as of the end of the season six finale beyond appearing unhappy with what she did
asoiaf,not_removed,while thats true theres a disbelief present when he sees her being crowned after tommens death that she could recreate a piece of aeryss planned destruction the event that made him take the honorable path instead of the honorable path ive been kind of waiting for jamie to be done with jersey for a few seasons maybe seeing her as queen shit will do that honestly though what is jamies trajectory if not bound to cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,if cerseis inner monologue is anything to go by the valonqar theory actually somewhat blinds you to the likelihood of jaime killing cersei it blinds cersei to the possibility that jaime might kill her though i am doubtful she would think jaime could kill her regardless of the prophecy but the reason readers keep bringing up a brother killing her is because of the prophecy in fact one of the complaints about cerseis prophecy is that it is too straightforward compared to a lot of the other ones
asoiaf,not_removed,this is legit brilliant ive never considered that winter comes to kings landing all three of her dead children come for her
asoiaf,not_removed,why are you assuming that her prophecy mechanics are like a genies wishes in how literal they must be how do you know shes not just some cruel old bitch who wants to scare a little high born girl with her blood magic you say all prophecies work like that what are you basing that statement on
asoiaf,not_removed,i personally think they are thorns to snub house tyrell since the choking part of the prophecy isnt in the show but i wouldnt have been surprised for the other way either they arent just pretty they are very detailed and specific they are basically the show version of the books food description
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree with you its like the dialogue and logic gets dumber every season i went from showbie to full on book snob im actually starting to hate the show because of how awful the writing has become its like they care more about appealing to the people who watch casually and think danys name is khalessi instead of the people who love and care about the story
asoiaf,not_removed,valonqar comes whilst killing cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,thats my expectation at least tommen ive written some posts about it but they all get shot down a lot of people dont seem to like me saying ive proven who the valonqar is maybe its metaphorical though in some ways but with winter coming it seems like the biggest possiblity
asoiaf,not_removed,valonqar rains on cerseis castemere whilst killing her
asoiaf,not_removed,do you have any in depth dissection of that id love to read it
asoiaf,not_removed,no not really more than the comment i posted im not much of a poster but its pretty much all right there my post i made like a year ago doesnt describe it even as much at that probably maggy only describes her children yet cersei takes it to mean her little brother when she finds out valonqar means little brother and she hates tyrion so much reading it in the moment makes it harder to really see that for multiple reasons for instance im pretty sure maggy only comes up because she was thinking about tyrion so everyone gets mixed up on what she may mean in the show i knew they were going to cut that line because it would spill out what she is really talking about in that context i imagine early this coming season they may have that scene but only in a very edited way to make it not completely obvious she is talking about tommen but only after a scene with tyrion or something
asoiaf,not_removed,if i recall correctly she is his aunt
asoiaf,not_removed,she would be his aunt were not sure if he was a bastard or not so that effects his claim also claims dont really matter in the game of thrones
asoiaf,not_removed,dany would be jons aunt in this case jon would actually have a better claim to the throne because he is the male heir of rhaegar danys brother which is important because the male heir always has a better claim even if dany is full targaryen and jon is only half the throne after the mad king should have fallen to rhaegar and since jon is his son it would fall to him next not dany httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphphousetargaryen but it doesnt include jon
asoiaf,not_removed,jon is the nephew of daenerys daenerys is the daughter of aerys the mad king and jons father is the son of aerys the mad king right now daenerys has no claim to the throne due to the ruling of the if jon is a targaryen bastard and is legitimized or if he is true born his claim is the only valid one if he is a bastard and stays illegitimate his claim could still be greater
asoiaf,not_removed,also claims dont really matter in the game of thrones they kind of do not to the great lords with their massive armies but to the vast majority of the realm its important their king actually be the king if there is widespread doubt rebels to the realm can easily use it to conspire and incite rebellion like the blackfyres did for their whole rebellion everybody knows that robert ascended to the throne because he won but the official ledger would have written that he ascended by virtue of his grandmothers blood
asoiaf,not_removed,except jon would need to be legitimized and recognized as the son of rhaegar and lyanna of which there are no records and no survivors who could testify on his behalf even if jon is legitimized hes still not seen as the rightful heir on accounts of not being known as rhaegars son remember rhaegar was married to elia of dorne so even if he was married by a septon to lyanna the previous marriage was not dissolved
asoiaf,not_removed,the blackfyre rebellions were lead by lords and exiled lords the people care more about not starving to death or being slaughtered for the most part but they are sheep to be corralled by lords when a lord shows up with an army and tells you to join most of the people will join because the alternative is death both dany and jon have more targ blood than robert so whichever raises the largest army has the better claim dany carries the targ name and isnt a bastard but shes also a woman jon had a smaller army currently and no dragons at this point neither has much of a claim but the wars and diplomacy ahead will decide which if either shall sit the iron throne
asoiaf,not_removed,ya forgot to put that in there him still possibly being a bastard but couldnt targaryens have multiple wives so if they did got married hed be legitimate right
asoiaf,not_removed,i should really clarify when i speak of the people i dont necessarily mean peasants i mean the smallholding lords the landless knights the professional soldiers etc these folks have the most to lose from massive destabilization of the realm which would be caused by frequent challenges to the ruling family from bastard branches or weak claims or anything like that most of the lords know theyre the smallfolk of the political elite but unlike the actual smallfolk they have enough power to unseat a king should the need arise this is with the backing of the maesters essentially what they did during roberts rebellion during roberts rebellion with relatively few exceptions almost the entirety of the smallholding lords in the rebelling kingdoms followed their liegelord this was in contrast and george goes to great lengths during the hedge knight to explain this to the blackfyre rebellion which pitted neighboring houses within the kingdoms against each other this was the fundamental reason why the realm struggled in the postblackfyre era already the bitterness of a more chaotic war splitting kingdoms and high lordships apart challenged the base of the feudal pyramid in feudalism of the high middle ages as westeros fairly clearly is in its a game of keep the people below you from rising higher this is why lords band together to crush upstart houses and when upstart houses win they are equally quick to legitimize their rule to those below robert claimed targaryen ancestry to sit on the iron throne everyone knew it was because he just took it but if youre a lord of a small fief the last thing you need is your neighbor looking over killing you and seizing your keep then claiming right of conquest as his justification you need to keep up the appearance that justification is needed that was why usurper was such a curse word to call robert a usurper was a challenge to the stability of the realm as a whole the boltons are given the title warden of the north the title means absolutely nothing except that is legitimizes their takeover of the north ramsay calls himself prince of winterfell instead of prince of the dreadfort because it legitimizes his rule the lords of the westerlands sit and watch and do nothing as tywin decimates house reyne because they realize one day they might have to do the same to one of their vassals its a massive juggling act and yes in the final days the winner is who has the strongest army but in the words of robb stark ive won every battle yet am losing the war the baratheons held the throne for a single generation daenerys exploits in slavers bay and mereen last barely a year the real game of thrones isnt court intrigue or well timed violence its won by whoever can win the most amount of legitimacy with the least amount of violence causing minimal damage to the realms stability this is why every other attempt to usurp the iron throne failed each and every single one of them threatened to destabilize the entire realm which lost the support of the lords down the feudal pyramid
asoiaf,not_removed,but couldnt targaryens have multiple wives iirc aegon the conqueror had multiple wives because he was a follower of the valyrian faith the high septon allowed him to keep his wives after he converted because you know dude had dragons and united the realm but agreed to not touch the church i dont know that any targaryens after him had multiple wives but that even just the sibling incest caused a fuck ton of conflict with the faith the faith militant uprising
asoiaf,not_removed,he wouldve also needed the kings permission only targaryens ever had multiple wives and they were both kings
asoiaf,not_removed,the bigger army is the more legitimate claim robb didnt win every battle because he had a larger army he had the smaller army but better tactics and luck until he didnt dany failed in meereen because she was trying to drastically change their economic system not because they didnt think she was legitimate that was just pretext to justify their actions by making the slaves equal to the the freeborn even the the poor freeborn people were moving down i definitely agree that stability is important to the realm but choosing a losing side doesnt provide much stability for ones self
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm said maegor the cruel has multiple wives from lines outside his own so there was and is precedent however the extent to which the targaryen kings could defy convention the faith and the opinions of the other lords decreased markedly after they no longer had dragons if you have a dragon you can have as many wives as you want and people are less likely to object
asoiaf,not_removed,the wiki at westerosorg includes chapter summaries at httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpchapters sounds like what youre looking for
asoiaf,not_removed,dragons breathe fire and lots of people die oh and boobies
asoiaf,not_removed,going by showonly information lyanna abducted by ran off with rhaegar hidden away in a tower guarded by kings guard with targaryen insignia on their armour dies giving birth to jon just who else could even a showonly person possibly think the father is
asoiaf,not_removed,is he the kind of person who doesnt mind going back and rewatching the show especially now that were in the offseason you could also just rewatch season but do it with the subtitles rhaegar is referenced a handful of times in season with an especially poignant scene at the end of the finale when bran is in the crypts he spells out who lyanna is and why robert went after her which is why robert wants to kill him thats lyanna my fathers sister king robert was supposed to marry her but rhaegar targaryen kidnapped her robert started a war to win her back he killed rhaegar but she died anyway thats where l saw father you can also have him watch the finale with subtitles lyanna says ive missed you big brother and if robert finds out hell you know he will and you her a k sound but for some reason that is left out of the text if he watched the previouslies for the finale there is the scene from season with sansa and littlefinger in the crypts talking about her aunt lyanna lfyour aunt lyanna she was already promised to robert baratheon sansafather never talked about her lfhow many tens of thousands had to die because rhaegar chose your aunt sansaand then he kidnapped her and raped her which is juxtaposed over shots of old nedrobert in the cryptsyoung ned at the tower of joy which was in the same season lyanna is also referenced at least one other time this season by sansa when talking to lyanna mormont and when bran flashes back to winterfell when they are all kids he sees lyanna and i think also says the same as sansa he never talked about her also in season at least one time dany mentions her brother rhaegar and jorah and barristan mention her brother a couple times in some of the other seasons in season ep robert to ned says what rhaegar targaryen did to your sister the woman l loved ill kill every targaryen i can get my hands on obviously you know all of this but these are at least the references that i can remember at the moment there are also plenty of references to roberts rebellion and aerys in season honestly the first time i watched season having never read the books all of that flew over my head its hard for me to pick up on stuff that happens off screen and is only discussed in dialogue its the kind of show that can still be enjoyed if you dont get the nuances because of the spectacle and the characters i had a hard time even figuring out all of the backstabbing in kl that was mostly on screen but i am also dumb but i think if you go back and at least see these little seeds that have been planted i think someone could figure it out nbsp these things are easy to miss since you dont see the characters faces on screen but watching it with the subtitles helps a lot
asoiaf,not_removed,howwhy does he think robert is the father how does that even make sense if he knows the story knows who rhaegar is why roberts rebellion was fought and all that and he still think jon is roberts son then gods help you
asoiaf,not_removed,im pretty sure that next season theyll create a scene with rhaegar and lyanna together to make it more obvious some kind of flash back or vision maybe wait off for that dd now probably realize that it might be necessary since many people dont get it without the deep detail and descriptions us book readers or subredditors get even remembering characters we dont regularly see or hear about on the show is a tough task tbh even with detailed descriptions its hard
asoiaf,not_removed,inception him ask him leading questions until he figures it out himself dont reveal anything until comes up with the right answer and he thinks it was his idea
asoiaf,not_removed,i really think the show shouldve included a flashback with rhaegar and lyanna together because so many people seem confused and i think a rhaegarlyanna flashback or bran vision wouldve helped a lot of people
asoiaf,not_removed,i wouldnt dance around the issue if i didnt know and my wife did i wouldnt resent being toldespecially if shed been privy to additional knowledge from reading the books its one thing if you want your husband to deduce it himself but much of the pleasure in the revelation isnt in just knowing its in the clever foreshadowing and in considering the potential implications for the story knowing the punchline puts you in a better position to be able to do this if your husband has watched everything to this point but still hasnt figured it out just show him this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkhqzfwodzqq
asoiaf,not_removed,show your husband the scene where robert asks how many times rheagar raped lyanna how many hundreds of times then show him the last toj scene done
asoiaf,not_removed,have him rewatch the few episodes of season robert mentions rhaegar and lyanna at some points
asoiaf,not_removed,hbo has confirmed rlj someone in another thread also put together a montage on youtube that shows all of the moments over seasons that pertain to this id show that to him as well
asoiaf,not_removed,have him watch credit to
asoiaf,not_removed,ask why the prince and heir to the throne had two kingsguard keeping lyanna in the tower maybe show him the scene from the previously on segment of sansa saying rhaegar kidnapped and raped her aunt it really is obvious if people pay attention
asoiaf,not_removed,tell him explain it if he still doesnt understand then dump him hes a bag of bricks
asoiaf,not_removed,robert it was hard to hear lyanna whispering to ned at least on our tv and i dont think the hubby caught the if robert finds out hell part which could be taken multiple ways anyway
asoiaf,not_removed,holy crap subtitles wow i would have never thought of that just seeing the name in print has to help with recognition thank you for the super helpful tips i do think i can get him to rewatch the show but maybe not until closer to season ill work on it but your suggestion about subtitles also brings to mind that he likes books on tape i think hed be much more willing to listen to the book series than read it and that would give him all the detail he needs appreciate your thoughtful response
asoiaf,not_removed,thats the thing i dont think he really even remembers rhaegar there are only maybe a half dozen mentions of him in the show
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope youre right its gotta be tough writing for both an audience of book readers who know intimate details about the story as well as a showonly audience who are getting super abridged versions of the story the show runners are also obviously very close to the story themselves so they may not even see what a casual watcher might see if the show runners are smart theyd check out reddit from time to time for suggestions
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope not with episodes left i dont want them wasting screen time for something that is already clear as day
asoiaf,not_removed,i will try this is actually really sound advice to use in life as well its always better when the other person thinks it was hisher idea thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,agree it could still happen as someone on this thread pointed out the reveal still needs to be made to jon somehow grrm confirmed jon would learn his parentage that scene could provide the needed clarity
asoiaf,not_removed,i like this thanks letting him arrive at it himself is definitely the way id prefer to go
asoiaf,not_removed,but much of the pleasure in the revelation isnt in just knowing its in the clever foreshadowing and in considering the potential implications for the story knowing the punchline puts you in a better position to be able to do this this thank you for putting it so eloquently i think i could show him the video you linked or possibly even the scene with lf and sansa in the crypts and see if he felt differently about anything based on that then quickly go to the fun theorizing part because youre right thats the best part appreciate your thoughts
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks i just saw that the montage might be just the thing
asoiaf,not_removed,yes this is a great montage
asoiaf,not_removed,if people pay attention thats the problem of the casual viewer i suppose but yes i will definitely try to get him to rewatch at least a couple of these clueridden scenes
asoiaf,not_removed,but i dont want to outrightly reveal it hed be mad if my super fandom gave away something hes not necessarily supposed to know yet i just dont know for sure if its an absolute yet on the show and that stupid chart made it no clearer
asoiaf,not_removed,if youre doing a rewatch get him to pay close attention to the description of the tourney at harrenhal that lf tells sansa at lyannas crypts they use rhaegars name a lot and make it suuuuper obvious in hindsight sometimes all it takes is a reminder that a character exists and it all clicks in place
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah np with this show its especially helpful since there are so many characters and some of the actors change so that makes it even more confusing i hope he goes back and rewatches it
asoiaf,not_removed,so then he must not remember why roberts rebellion was started eh if that were the case then id imagine hes missing out on a good amount of the story not just jons parentage
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre definitely going to inform jon too that should finally clear it up for both jon and the audience
asoiaf,not_removed,sure thing there are legitimate reasons why jons true parentage might still be confusing to showonly fans even if they care about the story and generally pay attention theres certainly enough there to make the deduction but the references to rhaegar are pretty scattered and theres no visual depiction of him to anchor them all to i think that simply having some image to associate with rhaegar—even if its a single scene—would serve to reinforce and organize all of the dialogue referring to him particularly in the books but even in the show rhaegars been built up as this striking largerthanlife presence who was central to setting the events of the story in motion if wed gotten even a glimpse of him people would hear the name and go oh yeah danys big brother when youre reading a book your brain has time to process and automatically start building up a mental image of the characters from their descriptions as well as other pieces of information with a show particularly one like got whose emphasis is on epic spectacle theres no comparable opportunity youre bombarded with the next shiny thing and dont make all the possible associations because tv is so visual show runners have a responsibility to depict rather than just describe characters or scenes that are central to the overall story ive heard a line of argument that says any casting or depiction of rhaegar will fall short of expectations so the show is better off not doing it but this is pure laziness if rhaegar is hard to depict thats a reason to try harder and get it right in any event helping people out with some additional clues wont ruin their enjoyment of the story
asoiaf,not_removed,viewers are supposed to know it by now dd just underestimated the attention span and ability to put pieces together of the show watchers they didnt realize they need to spoon feed everything to the audience thats why hbo had to smack people in the face with that chart the chart that clearly says rhaegar and lyanna are jons parents
asoiaf,not_removed,if he doesnt care then why bother trying to explain it
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks i appreciate that ill work on a rewatch with him and make sure he watches the previously on pieces
asoiaf,not_removed,not sure if he recalls but that might not be a bad question to start with its pretty innocuous and if followed by a few more very indirect leading questions he might be able to make the connection without throwing it right in his face thanks for the thought
asoiaf,not_removed,thats true didnt grrm confirm that jon would learn of his parentage if my attempts at a rewatch fail at least theres this thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,i think that simply having some image to associate with rhaegar—even if its a single scene—would serve to reinforce and organize all of the dialogue referring to him absolutely the visual nature of tv almost necessitates it i understand that taking an almost mythological character as rhaegar has been described and putting a face on him might be inevitably disappointing to some fans but i think it might be necessary so all fans are working with the same very important info
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt it a little silly that hbo had to release that chart i understand they did it for fans like my husband but if hes any representation of the showonly audience i doubt he will have any interest in looking at that web of confusion he enjoys got casually as a tv show hes not really looking to get into the detail and theory that the rest of us enjoy here so while the chart was meant to clear things up i think they failed on the intended audience of said chart
asoiaf,not_removed,great question i definitely care more than he does i suppose i want him to know so i can discuss the implications with him were facing down a long months before the next season i need my fix
asoiaf,not_removed,its not unclear if youre willing to really look at it but hes not a superfan and i can already see the eyeroll if i showed it to him i do like the questions bit though thank you ill work on getting him to rewatch it with me
asoiaf,not_removed,superb foil i want to believe this
asoiaf,not_removed,you missed a trick not naming the post the flyrells
asoiaf,not_removed,tldr per varamyr sixskins descriptions of those who warg birds luthor tyrell was a warg and willas garlan and loras might be too why ignore mace the ace he has show as much potential for being a warg as his sons have
asoiaf,not_removed,he has a passion for breeding animals as well and owns the finest hounds hawks and horses in the seven kingdoms that would be creepyright if he could skin change
asoiaf,not_removed,ive always attributed the tyrells hawking as a sign of wealth or opulence historically i believe its always been a hobby of the welltodo and members of high society ive grrms use of this as a shorthand to display their wealth and level of comfort in the seven kingdoms we typically see warging as being associated with the old gods or cotf people that still keep the old ways but i also thats not exclusive were just mostly familiar with the stark kids and wildlings there is house farwynd off on lonely light and i think awoiaf had rumors of other skinchangers out in essos so this might have some merit narratively speaking i dont what impact this might have if any but it would be quite the reveal if it turned out to be true
asoiaf,not_removed,willas being a magical cripple conforms with pjs thinking that severe injury coma or neardeath experience helps awaken the gift
asoiaf,not_removed,very much possible and probable but we may never know i always looked to luthor tyrells death as either an assassination by olenna or as a metaphor for the tyrells arc looking so high to the skies of power and falling on a cliff
asoiaf,not_removed,my interpretation of lord luthors hawk story was he intentionally rode off the cliff to avoid olenna
asoiaf,not_removed,that could be ive always thought that luthors horse was skin changed that seemed obvious but i always thought that blood raven or someone else did it but since br doesnt care about the tyrells at all i could see luthor himself doing it accidentally and it going wrong nice catch
asoiaf,not_removed,so maybe willass powers got triggered whilst convalescing from the tournament mishap that lamed him
asoiaf,not_removed,sam will be the luwincoleman to the crippled willas bransweetrobin luckily for willas the original oakenseat was destroyed so he wont be haunted by spirits like sweetrobin
asoiaf,not_removed,this is officially my favourite asoiaf theory screw jons parents or dany or sansa tyrell wargers are where its at
asoiaf,not_removed,adjusts foil scratches under the itchy layers of boiled leather nods in agreement
asoiaf,not_removed,this is intriguing
asoiaf,not_removed,good catch in the real world it would be suspicious that this was an arranged hunting accident in a world where there are people who can warg into birds and those people can become really enthralled with flying to the point where they ignore their own bodies this is entirely possible
asoiaf,not_removed,flyrells
asoiaf,not_removed,you had until you said daenerys was a good rider she isnt and before she married drogo she probably never rode a horse before
asoiaf,not_removed,me too i just hope the tyrells get more attention like the show did with them
asoiaf,not_removed,i want to believe that they can skinchange flowers
asoiaf,not_removed,you have a beautiful mind
asoiaf,not_removed,with that helmet the show gave him he practically turned into a peacock
asoiaf,not_removed,he wargs into a pufferfish
asoiaf,not_removed,how so
asoiaf,not_removed,even if hes still a terrible person
asoiaf,not_removed,and breaks one of the laws
asoiaf,not_removed,oh shit
asoiaf,not_removed,well i came across it while trying to figure out how willas tyrell knows so much about magic and how leo tyrell came to study with marwyn in practice its mostly a way to even the odds between willas and euron
asoiaf,not_removed,well there is the possibility that the starks descend from garth greenhand in fact it is quite likely that he was the first men leader overall given that his kids settled in the reach with the exception of one the possible stark ancestor it is actually quite possible that there are some latent skinchangers in fact the cranes apparently descend from a skinchanger the tyrells arent direct descendents of garth greenhand they are andals however given their position in the reach at least in the last years i think its likely they intermarried a lot with cranes hightowers tarlys oakhearts bulwers rowans florents redwynes fossoways probably forgot some house and before that with the gardeners they sure as hell could have the potential bloodwhise only that its super rare due to the andal blood i dont think luthor tyrell died while skinchanging willas being a skinchanger is interesting though there has to be something off about him i mean your sister marries the king and becomes queen and you dont get there to appreciate the moment either willas is totally imcapable in contrast to having a bad leg or there is something off like him constantly skinchanging or being a chupacabra i like this one more though
asoiaf,not_removed,im happy the democratically elected king was recognized in your list of skinchangers it is a fact often forgotten
asoiaf,not_removed,which makes you wonder what loras might be capable if he really was seriously wounded while attacking dragonstone
asoiaf,not_removed,after meeting olenna tyrion wonders if it was an accident
asoiaf,not_removed,i think it makes more sense if he was skinchanging his bird and not paying attention to what his horse was doing
asoiaf,not_removed,yup was just going to say that just like brans powers awake after the fall and jojen is a sickly and frail boy
asoiaf,not_removed,i think willas is far more knowledgable about things than those other two he is the heir to highgarden plus he knew how eurons fleet managed to sail out of sight of land which means he knows about magic already
asoiaf,not_removed,mmmmmmm the slightest pressure with her legs the lightest touch on the reins and the filly responded she sent it into a gallop and now the dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way as she turned to ride back a firepit loomed ahead directly in her path they were hemmed in on either side with no room to stop a daring she had never known filled daenerys then and she gave the filly her head the silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings she had an instant bond with it it filled her with daring she had never known and the first time she rode her horse she jumped it through flames
asoiaf,not_removed,its interesting because even if we dial it back a touch and say that ok well maybe they arent necessarily skinchangers but they still have this strong affinity for birds and flying it still makes sense they could be getting a milder sense of what bird skinchangers would experience
asoiaf,not_removed,plot twist taena myrish swamp merryweather is really not spying for margaery just like cercei thinks but the tyrells still know all her plans cause they eavesdrop on her all the time by skinchanging into nearby plants
asoiaf,not_removed,shame im shit at maths
asoiaf,not_removed,puff fish are from the summer isles and while mace prolly isnt a warg i think youre more right than you know check my edit
asoiaf,not_removed,he likes to sing
asoiaf,not_removed,fwiw i think do not mate as animal with animal is one of th most important laws i think mating as animals who do not have sentience and therefore do not have the concept of seual consent turns you into a rapist we need only look at euron and varamyr to see the end result of commiting this abomination thankfully bran is a parapelegic so even if he crosses this line its unlikely to turn him to the same evil
asoiaf,not_removed,do you think euron is a warg in some sense or do you mean just to have one type of magic going against whatever kraken or dragon euron could potentially have under his sway
asoiaf,not_removed,a chupacabra huh i always assumed it was a combination of his leg and wanting to have stay back and keep things running there must always be a tyrell in highgarden or something like that
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think luthor tyrell died while skinchanging neither do i i go along with haggons pronouncement even in their own skins they sit moony staring up at the bloody blue while he was in his own skin luthor appears to have zoned out while hawking enthralled by the sky and not paying attention to the ground around him this leaves the possibility that he had the ability to slip into the skin of his hawk which is what addicted him to flying
asoiaf,not_removed,no horse would just run off a cliff it would stop short and send him flying overhead if anything
asoiaf,not_removed,jojens green dreams began when he almost died of greywater fever
asoiaf,not_removed,oooh and we have prince peremore the twisted who also suffered from being twisted and clearly was a historical warg being the founder of the citadel and immediately building the ravenry the oldest building not to mention larys clubfoot who was master of whisperers a position that has historically been held by wargs bloodraven and those with access to a nonnatural survellience network
asoiaf,not_removed,well it has been a long time since i read agot but it could also be that horse is well trained a well trained war horse can be trained to completely ignore its instincts
asoiaf,not_removed,skin changing isnt exactly well defined arya seems to have the ability to be in two bodies at once it could be used mildly to draw animals and possibly people to you
asoiaf,not_removed,it was just a joke because his mother says he is like a pufferfish
asoiaf,not_removed,well he has already broken the other two
asoiaf,not_removed,good point
asoiaf,not_removed,theres about a dozen other examples of dany being completely fearless on horseback immediately riding like a dothraki and safe from viserys on a horse its a big reason why she acculturates to the dothraki so quickly
asoiaf,not_removed,theres also the detail where cersei is threatening marg by telling her about the reynes and talks about how as the most powerful family in westeros they only had one more step to nothing but blue skies above you or something like that obviously paraphrasing because i mangled it but i remember it as bird imagery
asoiaf,not_removed,i know but looking at that conversation is really helpful for figuring out what the tyrells are about the puff fish joke shows that margaery knows about the summer isles olenna disparges the summer isles calling them unimaginative as for maces affinity his wife is alerie hightower and we know at least gunthor hightower knows the summer tongue and communicates with summer islanders as shown in samwell v when he has a private conference with quhuru mo and after olenna leaves kl margaery and the other tyrells follow up on this interest in the summer isles by learning the summer tongue and leo tyrell is studying alongside a summer islander under marwyn right now so it seems like one of those jokes intended to hide a deeper meaning
asoiaf,not_removed,hi this topic is not covered by spoilers main if you repost with httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikispoilertagsystem such as spoilers extended youll be all set
asoiaf,not_removed,name unknown just means that we the readers have never been told his name
asoiaf,not_removed,just my personal opinion i wondered the same thing a few years back and i did a bunch of digging and then it slapped me in the face that the only info we have about him in the text and in the wiki is that hes the elder brother of athur and allyria and he dissappeared unaccountably well we have a character that looks more a fighter than a healer elder brother of quiet isle thats who i think he is
asoiaf,not_removed,thats not very tinfoily at all
asoiaf,not_removed,ser not appearing in this book
asoiaf,not_removed,is that hes the elder brother of athur and allyria and he dissappeared unaccountably no one mentioned that he had disappeared he is dead
asoiaf,not_removed,what can i say i prefer plastic wrap
asoiaf,not_removed,no matter what we name something we cant change its true nature
asoiaf,not_removed,we had a cat we called cat really because the cat was my brothers but because she had this perfect little black mark mid nose that looked like a hitler mustache he wanted to call her kitler we refused his abomination of a name and so since he wouldnt name her properly she just became cat our father was dragged off to be part of the hitler youth when he was young so there was no way we let that sweet cat ever be called kitler edit maybe dogs name was frey or something horrible better he be dog
asoiaf,not_removed,its what he is i had a dogg named dog pronounced deogie
asoiaf,not_removed,this intrigued me as well when i read it i immediately became suspicious that sandor was going to show up and he did but i also feel like there is more to it that im missing
asoiaf,not_removed,im a simple man and it makes me laugh every time
asoiaf,not_removed,ive had plenty of pets named dog cat puppy kitty and my favorite horse horse
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe grrm is saying sometimes things are exactly as they seem and we shouldnt read too much into things
asoiaf,not_removed,when i read this chapter i couldnt help but think of which used to air in the detroit area in the late
asoiaf,not_removed,i know someone who has adog named dog pronounced dee oh gee and a cat named cat pronounced cee ay tee i promise im not joking
asoiaf,not_removed,a fine stew
asoiaf,not_removed,i can understand ive always been bad with names too had cats when i was little the black cat and the fat cat then a few years later i had a cat i named after myself andy then she got killed by a street cat and the other cat i again named andy so yeah
asoiaf,not_removed,kitler sounds kind of adorable if you forget about the whole thing with you dad though
asoiaf,not_removed,we had a black cat when i was a kid that we could never agree on a name for he was rhett butler for a while but eventually he was just black cat
asoiaf,not_removed,came here to say i had a friend who named his dog dog
asoiaf,not_removed,was it the horse from horsin around
asoiaf,not_removed,or the exact opposite hes saying that the gravedigger must be somebody but since he hasnt said who he is hes just the gravedigger for now
asoiaf,not_removed,i had a dog named dee oh gee spelled dog
asoiaf,not_removed,thats epic lol
asoiaf,not_removed,it was always fun taking him to the vet vet whats his name me dee oh gee vet how do you spell it me d o g vet stupid look
asoiaf,not_removed,lysa still gave him a death sentence the high road tyrion lannister said lysa allowed herself a faint satisfied smile it was another sort of death sentence catelyn realized tyrion lannister must know that as well yet the dwarf favored lady arryn with a mocking bow as you command my lady he said i believe we know the way if she wanted him safe she could have kept him there supplied him with a boat to sail to kings landing at gulltown or sent him with her own guards instead she sent him with one man to face the mountain clans
asoiaf,not_removed,rereading this chapter knowing the out come is almost comical it seems everything lysa does her pick her giving him the sword is a sillyl mistake and bron just sits there all cool like
asoiaf,not_removed,lysa is dumb as a thumb man if she had any goals at all she carries them out obviously and badly
asoiaf,not_removed,i like the theory and it would be nice if it were true i just never got the impression that lysa was that wily i dont think she thought that anyone could successfully take the vale from her so she was free to kill whoever she liked that said this makes a lot of sense i cant think of why she would have picked the one person who didnt volunteer and didnt want to fight to do it except that she just made bad decisions in general
asoiaf,not_removed,ladymanderly hit it right on the head i feel baddest for ser vardis egen he was a true knight of the vale and a badass i love bronn i love bronn for being a blackhearted rogue and assassin mercenary sellsword etc but i dug ser vardis too and he got a raw deal fucking lysa arryn she also doomed robb if she sent the knights of the vale down to riverrun to rendezvous with robb perhaps roose bolton would not have turned treasonous whoreson but even if he tried the knights of the vale make all the difference robb at the very least carves out the top half of westeros as the kingdom of north and trident fucking lysa arryn
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know if lysa was smart enough to do the whole got thing i mean she had all her hopes pinned on petyr littlefinger baelish how smart can a person making littlefinger lord of the vale be
asoiaf,not_removed,upvotes and downvotes aplenty but no comments come on where is your sunday tinfoil
asoiaf,not_removed,its not really tinfoily and has been brought up here several times
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry it just doesnt seem evident enough
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly i dont think she has the foresight or sanity to come up with such a plan if she wanted to keep tyrion hostage as a means to keep the lannisters out keeping him in a sky cell is a bad idea even if only temporary i think shes an insane paranoid clutz
asoiaf,not_removed,well to be fair the shy girl she had known at riverrun had grown into a woman who was by turns proud fearful cruel dreamy reckless timid stubborn vain and above all inconstant catelyn agot then again if he dies to mountain clans he dies to mountain clans shit happens catelyn almost died to mountain clans just getting there i mean the lannisters could and lets be honest probably would blame her for it but in her mind she could consider it so that she washed her hands on the matter problem was that she couldnt keep him as a hostage anymore and no way will lysa arryn who hates the lannisters supply tyrion the deformed imp with a large armed escort and a ship when she refuses to send even one knight to help robb
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i honestly feel sorry for vardis he just does the duty that has been put upon him by the role he has earned had he been twenty years younger theres a good chance he wouldve won that fight
asoiaf,not_removed,if she had any goals at all she carries them out obviously and badly well she did manage to get catelyn and the rest of the north who knew a lick about it to suspect the lannisters of murdering jon arryn
asoiaf,not_removed,except that she just made bad decisions in general and to be fair that is a common theme in game of thrones people making the wrong calls without it the story would not be even remotely as compelling after all
asoiaf,not_removed,she also doomed robb she didnt really she never promised him that she would nor was she under any obligation to nor did robb consult with his aunt before he raised his banners and went to war robb was doomed in part because of himself and the actions of his own vassals it was never on lysa
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean youd say fuck lysa arryn because youre reading as a fan of the starks but her decision to keep the vale neutral really did put them in the best possible prelong winter situation no knights died in the no peasants died so theyve been stockpiling food for awhile and they have no enemies that we know of why should she go to war for neds sake when she and everyone else in westeros believed him to be a true traitor and why should she defend her envied sisters boneheaded decision to capture tyrion and bring him to her doorstep
asoiaf,not_removed,its possible she didnt want tyrion there in the first place when he arrived she asked why did you bring him to the vale then was all for a trial and possible death sentence also the armour that she give ser vardis being a hindrance to him its obvious to the majority that it puts him at a distinct disadvantage i guess putting him out on the road with the mountain clans is her way of saving face in front of everybody and also covering her cos if tyrion died on the road then it wouldnt be from her doing i seriously doubt tywin would see it that way and could still wage war but lysa just being a bat shit crazy bitch explains everything 😂
asoiaf,not_removed,your analysis was really good my lady
asoiaf,not_removed,i think you are correct dont really see any argument against your analysis especially if you think that jon arryn was not in fact poisoned by the lannisters but by lysa herself on littlefingers instructions
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry i just recently started reading this sub closely if its been covered before sorry
asoiaf,not_removed,either way young or not bronn would still only speak up and fight for tyrion if he felt confident enough that hed win pretty easily this is routine behavior for bronn throughout the series and when tyrion wants him to fight gregor before oberyn announces he will bronn straight up tells tyrion it doesnt work like that and all of the previous fights battles missions etc that tyrion sent him on were done so only because bronn felt comfortable with his opponent
asoiaf,not_removed,but thats only because she listened to youknowwho as i recall the letter was hardly her idea
asoiaf,not_removed,but littlefinger is the brains behind that whole operation and the north is more inclined to believe in the lannisters guilt because of their own prejudices all lysa really had to do was write the words out for the letter and say its true when cat gets there
asoiaf,not_removed,it was never on lysa it kind of is though if it wasnt for lysa ned would never have considered the lannisters to have murdered jon arryn and catelyn wouldnt have arrested tyrion and so on and so forth a lot was on lysa because she was a tool for littlefinger
asoiaf,not_removed,uh yeah righto
asoiaf,not_removed,no it wasnt her idea but it was her actions just because you went on to do something someone else told you to do hardly abstains you from guilt
asoiaf,not_removed,it was certainly on lysa she set ned up to be eventually murdered
asoiaf,not_removed,and what does guilt have to do with competence
asoiaf,not_removed,that means she was responsible for her actions aka it was her fault that the starks suspected the lannisters of murdering jon arryn
asoiaf,not_removed,it was her fault that the starks suspected the lannisters but it was not her scheme it was not her thinking she just did as she was told the same way joffrey schemed the attempt at brans life joff is guilty because without him no one would have tried to kill bran the cats paw is also guilty but it was not him who thought of trying to kill bran he just did as he was told with lysa it is even worse because she is knowingly endangering her own family with her actions
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah and what does that have to do with what we where talking about ever since the post that said
asoiaf,not_removed,of course she had goals she had a goal to please littlefinger and she did fucking amazing she got the entire kingdom of westeros to drain the military and economic resources except for dorne following littlefingers instructions if she was completely useless at what she did catelyn wouldnt have believed her when she met her and her court wouldve revolted against her poor rule but she kept all the male leaders in check by hinting at that she was intending to marry one of them shes paranoid shortsighted vain etc but shes not useless
asoiaf,not_removed,no one said she was useless i mean lf used her very well p as for pleasing him as her goal going flying kind of means she failed at it
asoiaf,not_removed,the two you listed are the ones i use as well there are some great ones out there in terms of geekiness and depth but for some reason the audio quality was always shit
asoiaf,not_removed,i like boiled leather audio hour
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i really like both podcasts radio westeros is well ptoduced
asoiaf,not_removed,check out vassals of kingsgrave they have some cool podcasts at this point theyve covered pretty much everything asoiaf related
asoiaf,not_removed,i remember a theory about the religion of the drowned godthat the ironborn are actually praying to the great other and the white walkers its origins laid within the first long night and that wights were stranded on the iron islands where they rose again this led to the saying what is dead may never die
asoiaf,not_removed,im adding another looking at a map of the known planetos world i like to think the eastern edge of essos hooks northward and wraps the north pole straight into westeros youll also notice that the land of always winter in westeros maps goes off into the north west there are mythologies very much like the long night in essos the lion of night and his demons others descended from the grey waste into essos theres even the equivalent of the wall in essos blocking off the grey waste from yi ti called the five forts which are apparently gigantic hulks of stone over feet high the only other places weve known manmade structures to reach that height are the wall itself and the hightower i like to think that during the long night the others went to war against humanity on two fronts essos and westeros or not but thats the fun of it
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime lannister is azor ahai reborn not mine but i love the parallels to norse mythology i hate that ham bit there though its strong enough a correlation without having jaime been reborn amidst salt and smoke i think the author is really reaching there
asoiaf,not_removed,in the past dragon eggs hatched in the presence of targaryens yet danys only hatched in the fire are there any theories as to this discrepancy side questionidea if dany had a dragon egg placed in her cradle like egg etc im guessing they kept this tradition up till roberts rebellion would it have hatched or did dany lack the hatching quality ie without the pyre etc
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry not a theory but a qa i stupidly forgot to post yesterday i seem to remember racefortheit using a link about the supplies etc that medieval armies used etc does anyone know the link
asoiaf,not_removed,moqorro seems to agree with the idea
asoiaf,not_removed,thats a very plausible theory consistent too with the idea that the iron islands were a leper colony of sorts
asoiaf,not_removed,while i tend to agree the five forts and grey waste might indicate another front against the others i think its very unlikely that eastern essos hooks up with westeros check out this map by uwerthead that theorizes how big terros actually is and what we know fits into that area based on what maps we have and a little speculation on his part theres a lot of room between eastern essos and westeros and if the farwynds are correct and i like to think they are theres probably another continent that divides them while it may be possible for essos to go north and somehow hook up with westeros that swath of land would be yuuge
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm said they are not connected in any way
asoiaf,not_removed,hes deep down in the bowels of casterly rock and is accosted by his halfbrother rhaegar targaryen lost me right there edit after skimming through the rest way too much ajcj
asoiaf,not_removed,im going with the crazy idea that loras will be azor ahai last we knew he was dying on dragonstone but will somehow be resurrected
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks for the shout out
asoiaf,not_removed,what is the theory about lemore white fawn i havent heard this one before
asoiaf,not_removed,the only theory ive seen that comes to mind is prestons xy dragon hatching gene theory on youtube
asoiaf,not_removed,this is a really interesting idea though what would happen if she was given newer eggs if hers really were ancient she is the mother of dragons maybe she can hatch the eggs her family kept if theyre still around which i doubt maybe she cant have living human children but instead hatches dragons i have no backing for this idea and i doubt its true but i wonder if george would answer that scenario
asoiaf,not_removed,dany is a dayne confirmed rejoice have a lemon she needed black magic because she isnt a targaryen i need no further proof
asoiaf,not_removed,that map crashes my reddit browser
asoiaf,not_removed,i was just thinking about making a post on this subject id be shocked if it wasnt this way just because it always seems to get warmer no matter how far south you go
asoiaf,not_removed,anymore clearly they were at one point
asoiaf,not_removed,preston himself discredited his dragon genetics theory in the latest dornish masterplan video or the one before it too fucking tired to remember which one
asoiaf,not_removed,i had watched most of prestons videos except for that one because i found the premise ridiculous i watched it a few weeks ago and actually found it really interesting
asoiaf,not_removed,do you know why he discredited it
asoiaf,not_removed,thank you for the lemon lol
asoiaf,not_removed,you realise they have like episodes to wrap the show up right dd sure do love their darth sansa but theres no way theyll have the time to do anything like this
asoiaf,not_removed,you are sure dude no
asoiaf,not_removed,the way they threw her aside she will probably just fade
asoiaf,not_removed,stop trying to make lsh happen it wont happen
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry not gonna happen besides the terrible writingplotting that would be d d have said that the show is now at the point where all the pieces are on the table this means weve previously been introduced to all the elements of the endgame for people who havent read the books which is most viewers of the tv show stoneheart would be a major and confusing twist out of left field elements of stonehearts subplot however will be peppered into sansa and aryas archs imo
asoiaf,not_removed,just episodes to wrap the whole content of twow and ados im amazed
asoiaf,not_removed,elaborate
asoiaf,not_removed,well already put them well into twow territory but yeah they do seem to be a weird rush to finish it
asoiaf,not_removed,season was twow the way it ended dany invading westeros jon as kitn arya leaving the fm cersei becoming queen is how we should expect twow to end
asoiaf,not_removed,ugh youre right but it almost makes me sad it is all almost over
asoiaf,not_removed,i cant wait to see how wrong you are
asoiaf,not_removed,look at season hes already right
asoiaf,not_removed,no no season was actually very good these people are just unsatisfied with how the show is plotted so they subconsciously make crticisms of problems that arent actually there or inflate flaws that matter very little in order to feel justified about their opinion
asoiaf,not_removed,people are just unsatisfied with how the show is plotted and this is invalid what he said was right theres very little subtlety and nuance left in the show thats what made it interesting every character is just suddenly conflated into teams with barely any issues with each other theres no northern conspiracy no variety of plots and motives just bad vs good with some people sitting on the fence until they join a team and theyre forgotten anyway characters dont act understandably any more theyre just forced along to do whatever to push the story forwards
asoiaf,not_removed,the way i look at it is that wasnt bad by any means but they also missed out on certain opportunities to make it so much better these opportunities werent hidden or anything the show runners just rushed the content to get to the end goal instead of fleshing out the story for example kingsmoot sweet sounds like a great opportunity to expand on the ironmen culture the dynamics between greyjoys the charisma of euron or we can just skip it and have euron declare war dorne sweet this is a great opportunity to explore new angels to look at the war dorans plots for revenge ellarias want for peace the sand snakes need for war and the side plot to crown myrcellaor we could just kill off half those characters early so dorne can declare for war meereen sounds like a perfect opportunity to demonstrate the struggles of change and the struggles to hold power without violence nah lets just have the slavers declare war and get wiped out by dragons within a season cotf this is so cool they are so interesting lets flesh out their story and drill home the fact that they are the last of their kind or just kill them offwho cared about that anyways the list goes on and on isnt bad but it could have been so much more whether thats a flaw or not it was disappointing for a lot of fans from the books that doesnt mean they inflate flaws and critic none existent problems
asoiaf,not_removed,every character is just suddenly conflated into teams with barely any issues with each other why do you say that theres clearly tension between brienne and davos over stannis death you saw davos and mellisandre butt heads when davos found out about shireen the vale lords all hate littlefinger and his control over sweetrobin but they must listen to their lord how will that dynamic develop now that many of the vale lords were there to proclaim jon as kitn we havent seen how kings landing operates after cerseis crowning but there was clear tension between the lannisters and the tyrells even though cooperation has always been in both of their self interests we havent seen how danys new camp likes each other but i think its safe to say that there will at least be a little bit of confrontation between ellaria sand and tyrion seeing as oberyn died fighting for tyrions innocence theres plenty of tension between players on the same team but if youre only looking to be dissappointed by the show then youll never see whats really going on
asoiaf,not_removed,youre speaking from the perspective of a book reader asking for the show to inflate these plotpoints to the point where it doesnt have room or time for anything else it devotes as much time as needed to what it has to the problem a lot of book readers have is theyre looking at the show through the lens of it being an adaptation up for comparison to the source material which will never be satisfying instead of simply taking it as a television show ergo in comes the inflation of these criticisms
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed but i started out as a show watcher even before reading the books the flaws became apparent fast i remember watching with my sister and her asking me why the sand snakes murdered their uncle to avenge their father i remember making excuses to validate in my mind that the show my oh so favorite show was perfect later i came to grips with the fact that it isnt perfect in fact there are tons of flaws after reading the books i see them more and more i just use the books to show how to do the story right because i think comparison gets the point across faster but the books arent needed to understanding the missed opportunities of the show
asoiaf,not_removed,why the sand snakes murdered their uncle to avenge their father well that right there is just not paying attention edit however i am not saying there arent any valid criticisms because there are but i think the vast majority are unwarranted and i feel like missed opportunities is a meaningless phrase because that basically equates to the writers did something else instead of what i wanted so thats bad im perfectly happy with how the kingsmoot in the show went meereen among other things they do what they need to for the characters and plot if we got the kingsmoot similar to the book it would have ended up being wasted time that is undeniable
asoiaf,not_removed,not paying attention lol if i wanted to avenge my father and to do that i needed war and my fathers brother wanted to start a war albeit slowly i wouldnt kill my fathers brother who my father loved just to start said war faster that was the show runners getting too antsy not the sand snakes oberyn probably wouldnt want his brother to die due to some family disagreements furthermore it would be extremely risky the chances dorne follows them are really low considering they are all bastards and doran almost certainly has other direct family cousins even their entire plan bet on the hope that the writers wanted them in charge even if they did get command unlikely the chance that all of dorne supports them is near impossible essentially after killing their prince this would divide dorne and reduce dornes fighting power which would reduce chances of vengeance much safer to get vengeance through doran due to him having complete control over dorne im sorry but i agree with my sis on this one xd edit lets not even get started with the guards hotah included their job is to protect doran even if the sand snakes managed to kill doran unlikely them surviving to tell the tale is near impossible the divided dorne also would lead to internal problems like dany with meereen which would be dangerous for the sand snakes the plan didnt make sense and only succeeded because the writers gave the script to a half dead squirrel
asoiaf,not_removed,woah woah woah calm buddy calm alright im going to now explain the shows version of dorne and not the books this includes doran according to ellaria in the house of black and white all of dorne or the majority that matters are calling for war but doran doesnt want to and even when they invade to abduct their princess doran refuses to punish the lannisters and instead wants to befriend them it stopped being about avenging oberyn and turned into punishing the lannisters with that in mind and this being a subplot in a television series stuffed with them its passable though not great for this coup to occur there are still several questions and logical fallacies dont mistake me but im just saying your sister misunderstood the sned snacks motivation
asoiaf,not_removed,so why again does doran send oberyn to the lannisters if not for war just to have a dornishmen on the counsel then why the one dornishmen doran knows will start a war doran sends oberyn to kings landing to start the war although the trial was likely not dorans plan either way it started out in the same way it did in the show and the evidence in both points to dorans wanting war elia is also a plot point in the show although not touched on frequently this means there should be tension between the lannisters and doran not just lannisters and oberyn cause they were both elias brother
asoiaf,not_removed,you are correct he was sent in dorans stead nothing more in the show it is as simple as that again you people are confusing the books with the show shoberyn has demonstrated that he is too smart to start a war
asoiaf,not_removed,again im really not why send oberyn over any other dornishmen doran knows oberyn will spark tension sending him is silly if not for want of war edit sounds like the show runners are borrowing from the books and changing it without thinking of what other plot points need to change as well if doran doesnt want war send any other dornish lord thus oberyn lives thus sand snakes dont care doran survives
asoiaf,not_removed,because oberyn is his only family that can travel we dont know what oberyn said to doran but im pretty sure the man knew what his brother was going to do in the capital plunge their country into war is not one of them that is just stupid and hey hey oberyn did not because he is smarter than that and weve seen he is smarter than that
asoiaf,not_removed,huh oberyn clearly wanted war he was open about hating the lannisters and wanted revenge for the death of elia any other dornishmen would have less blood with the lannisters because they werent blood related with elia the reason he sends oberyn in the books is to spark tension thus if doran doesnt want war in the show oberny shouldnt be sent
asoiaf,not_removed,oberyn wanted vengeance and justice for elia but he didnt say he wanted war i think youre just reading the shows version through the books lens the most telling scene in the show is when tywin meets oberyn who asks why he doesnt kill him right there but oberyn doesnt because these two characters arent fucking lunatics who would start a needless war this on top of oberyns assurance that myrcella will not be hurt cements my assertions that doran trusted oberyn wasnt going to start an actual war just get justice for elia
asoiaf,not_removed,this may help
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think its ever mentioned it depends on the weather and whether theyre mounted or on foot travelling along the base of the wall or the top and if theyre camping in open spots or in prepared camping positions a very very rough rule of the thumb is that someone can march about miles in a day and maybe miles on horseback a bit more is possible if theyre willing to halfkill the horse or they can swap for a fresh mount somewhere but that slows down a lot in rain or snow so i say that under very good conditions a mounted person could ride the length of the wall in about a week or walk it in between ten days and two weeks also as mentioned previously check out my blog which goes into the size of westeros in more detail httpsatlasoficeandfireblogwordpresscom
asoiaf,not_removed,httpsatlasoficeandfireblogwordpresscom especially some of the older posts
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks a ton
asoiaf,not_removed,they could fund khaleesis navy
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the show forgot about them
asoiaf,not_removed,i disagree heavily on daenerys theres so much possibility and foreshadowing left in essos to explore sacking volantis and yunkai for example that i cant imagine grrm not exploring if we leave arya alone in essos its very unlikely well be getting that at all additionally daenerys has fully accepted her violent side and means to bring terror to those whove wronged her you should read the meereenese blot dany has succeeded in creating stable peace in slavers bay and events truly beyond her control have led to the battle of fire those whove recently wronged her in her mind at least and thats the great tragedy of her arc are the volantene and the yunkish not the westerosi fire and blood means very little if we dont see volantis burning and a massacre of slavers which imo leads to the conclusion that daenerys will not reach westeros until the very end of twow
asoiaf,not_removed,also the battle of fire happens at the end of adwdbut not until the end of season where did you buy a version of adwd with the battle of fire
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel like the entire battle of meereen in the books will occur before dany returns the battle has just begun when adwd ends and it will likely take dany at least a couple months id say to return with a khalasar
asoiaf,not_removed,also the battle of fire happens at the end of adwd no it doesnt rather throws a spanner in the works that
asoiaf,not_removed,eh i always believed that martin intended the battle of fire to be completed without daenerys even being there i agree that she will be in westeros by the end of twow though also dany would be mad to name the depressed mess that tyrion became in adwd the hand of the queen
asoiaf,not_removed,i assume the op confused them preparing for the battle with the real battle which starts in the barristan sample chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,eslaversbay or dothrakizon
asoiaf,not_removed,tbf its already been quite a bit of time since dany left i could see her returning in the middle of it
asoiaf,not_removed,its been so many years i think some people forget those sample chapters are twow chapters
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion has a lot of dark impulses youll see more and more of that the farther you read not for nothing does grrm call him equally bad and good in asos
asoiaf,not_removed,well its westeros its tyrion and its sansa in westeros a girl flowered is not a child anymore but is a woman just as a old lady tyrion is a womanlover he sees the prettiest girl of the story naked and well he cant always hide his bodys reactions anyway especially not when hes naked as well however in this world even though shes sansa is commonly seen as a woman just remember the moment when she notices that her clothes are getting too small at her chest and all the men are looking at it that was the especially creepy part however i dont understand the common opinion about sansa being a cruel bitch as she doesnt accept to sleep with him just because he left her alone on their wedding night even if men desire her she herself is no more than a child married to an extremely ugly man whos twice her age and whos from a family she despises
asoiaf,not_removed,think of it from his perspective in westeros you are considered a woman when you have your moons blood sure she is young but by all laws she is a women also tyrion has always been a lustful man plus with all the wine he drank that night none of his actions are surprising also just looked it up sansa is supposed to be just as bad but i dont see how this could ruin the character for you
asoiaf,not_removed,this might make you feel better about tyrion sansa is a woman at this point and by all account one of the most beautiful tyrion might be one of the very few guys in all of westeros who wouldnt have done it he was also drug and still stopped himself think any other males in this story would have held back
asoiaf,not_removed,remember this is a medival society there is no such thing as adolescence yet that doesnt come around till the industrial revolution there are two things that females can be a child or a woman sansa is a complete and full woman she has flowered there is no difference from her at to someone who is they are both considered fully grown women it is very natural for people to find people under attractive it is our society that has called it unnatural when in fact it is our society that is going against nature
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah its creepy but supposedly the years are a little longer on planetos a year old is more like
asoiaf,not_removed,try not to judge with real life standards otherwise targaryen and jaimecerseis incest feels wrong too
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah this made me not like tyrion anymore since he was seriously debating on whether he should lay with her and he actually wanted her
asoiaf,not_removed,tryion obviously seems to still see her as a child even though she has flowered hence the reason he said youre a child
asoiaf,not_removed,you have been listening to too many myths excluding extreme circumstances you could not marry a woman above the age of they knew that the younger a woman was when she gave birth the more likely both her and baby would die which would be counterproductive to idea of building alliances with blood and marriages
asoiaf,not_removed,its not so much the age thing that bothers me its the fact that year olds arent mentally mature listen to a friendgroup of year olds or whatever and they are extremely immature feel pressured and a lot of them are confused as to what is to be expected of them its a difficult and confusing time for a lot of people for that reason im glad our society is going against nature so teenage girls cant get prayed upon by grown men well without a chance of going to prison atleast lol
asoiaf,not_removed,no theyre not thats just fanon to make the characters be older a year old in their world is a year old on our world
asoiaf,not_removed,in medieval days this was pretty common and to most it is an acceptable practice
asoiaf,not_removed,im not saying that they couldnt tell the difference between a year old and an year old of course there are some differences with people but the fact is that there was no adolescence in medieval societies if you flowered you were a full fledged woman
asoiaf,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikimarriageableagehistoryandsocialattitudes httpwwwfaqsorgchildhoodaarageofconsenthtml
asoiaf,not_removed,seems common in since parts of the world even today
asoiaf,not_removed,you have been listening to too many myths or reading some you know actual history
asoiaf,not_removed,also consider that in westeros children are not coddled like the children are in our societies they have watched people have sex have seen them be killed the poor ones have felt hunger cold and homelessness so the children in westeros emotionally age much faster and become adults at a younger age not necessarily emotional maturity comes from both nature and nurture sure in our society we coddle our children for good reasons at the cost of them remaining emotionally immature for longer then for legal enforcement reasons we pick a number years where we agree that in our society most people have crossed over the adult threshold
asoiaf,not_removed,well rob leads an army to war at people there mature differently to be honest just mentally add four years to everyones age and all the younger characters will be much more relatable
asoiaf,not_removed,well that group you were listening to is a group of year olds in our society we are raised to behave like teenagers so we do if we raised our kids to be adults at they would not seem immature have you seen some year olds who had to go to work and support their family at that age they arent immature they are very mature the same thing for year olds in hunter gatherer cutlures they are raised to be men and they dont behave immaturely the immatureness of teenagers is not a natural thing it is something that we bring out of people in our society if you treat an adult like a kid they will act like a kid
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but year olds in our world were married and bedded and went to war in medieval times
asoiaf,not_removed,the average a woman was married in the middle ages was not like you guys belive
asoiaf,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrasoiafaboutrules please dont disparage other religions on rasoiaf whatever your opinions are this subreddit is not the place for that
asoiaf,not_removed,yes and for the average to be there must be a significant portion of the girls getting married under that age lets suppose there were marriages per year in medieval england the population back then was about million people so i think its a conservative estimate since most women married from their late teens to the age of lets suppose as much as of them women were years old in average x accumulated years now how old would the other have to be to bring the total average down to years of age x accumulated years this means that the remaining girls would have to make a total of years ie they would have to be years old in average ok that cant happen what if the was years old in average instead of x for the average to be the remaining would have to make a total of years so they would be years old in average still bad people dont get married two years before being born we need to improve lets say of those girls are years old in average x now were going somewhere at least we dont have to deal with negative numbers anymore the minority now reach total years but alas theyre still too young years old in average since this is not realistic it follows that if the average age at which women were getting married in medieval england was years then there must have been many many younger girls getting married certainly more than of them note also that even though i made up the marriagesyear figure the mathematical results are independent of that number you would reach the exact same conclusions whether the universe were or just marriages
asoiaf,not_removed,ive removed a couple of your comments in this thread while you are free to disagree please do so respectfully httpswwwredditcomrasoiafaboutrules please dont call others names or insult them in other ways thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,fair enough
asoiaf,not_removed,they could think that theres a never ending storm in the stormlands the meereenese already think that the dornish worship snakes
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty sure they believe westeros is ruled by animalmen most major houses are represented by animals like stags lions falcons or direwolves and so they might believe that westeros is currently ruled by a man with the head of a lionstag
asoiaf,not_removed,they believe banjen is daario
asoiaf,not_removed,the dragons were last seen in that direction best avoided there are men there with steel skins
asoiaf,not_removed,the lion lord lives in a palace made of actual gold and goes into battle clad in solid gold plate the dragonlords each fly dragons as large as a castle harrenhal is a dead castle the size of a great city inhabited by the ghosts of its many dead the lords of the north wear armor of solid ice and go into battle with armies of wolves the iron islands are inhabited by demon worshippers whos sole purpose is to slaughter and pillage all in the name of their eldritch god dragonstone is an island made of the corpses of dragons long since turned to stone storms end is ruled by men with the head of stags whos fortress can withstand the wrath of the gods themselves
asoiaf,not_removed,that the high tower actually touches the sky that the wall is a large fortress than can house and is manned by thousands of men all clad in black feathers maybe they are actually crows would a parallel of the five fortress each capable of housing men which actually sounds absurd beyond the wall is the white waste as in beyond the five forts is the grey waste the whole continent is dominated by religious fanatics maesters
asoiaf,not_removed,that they all bang their siblings
asoiaf,not_removed,it is customary to murder wedding guests as a sacrifice to ensure the wedding night produces a child
asoiaf,not_removed,theres a lord who has an army of thousands of his own children who garrison his to identical castles
asoiaf,not_removed,that on a wedding night the guests undress the bride and groom and watch them fuck oh wait
asoiaf,not_removed,they abhor slavery yet treat their smallfolk like slaves anyways
asoiaf,not_removed,what the fuck is going on over there
asoiaf,not_removed,that the northern kingdom was ruled by wolfmen who eat their own subjects
asoiaf,not_removed,they worship glycon
asoiaf,not_removed,hail hydra
asoiaf,not_removed,after he murdered the dragon kingwaitdo they think that westeros is tamriel
asoiaf,not_removed,and when robert got killed by a boar and joffrey got killed by an imp fun images
asoiaf,not_removed,there was one scene in the books where the pit fighters or whoever it was underestimated jorah because of his lobster armor ive always thought that some idiots must really think that westero is filled with actual lobster knights
asoiaf,not_removed,lots of bestiality rumors
asoiaf,not_removed,and there are mermen passing as fat eunuchs
asoiaf,not_removed,but thats true
asoiaf,not_removed,that made me laugh out loud
asoiaf,not_removed,the iron islands are inhabited by demon worshippers whos sole purpose is to slaughter and pillage all in the name of their eldritch god well
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean the iron islands one is just the truth is it not
asoiaf,not_removed,i like the one
asoiaf,not_removed,the iron islands one is not too off the mark
asoiaf,not_removed,i love the one
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly the wall is ridiculous as itself
asoiaf,not_removed,religious fanatics maesters i am pretty sure maesters are the total opposite of that
asoiaf,not_removed,there are forts on the wall they could definitely house thousands of men
asoiaf,not_removed,the white waste is actually mentioned in twoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,they dont watch they just wait outside
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre hypocrites you mean
asoiaf,not_removed,lets not go to westeros tis a silly place
asoiaf,not_removed,all hail glycon the all powerful
asoiaf,not_removed,or apep
asoiaf,not_removed,they say ned stark murdered the high king with his voice barked him apart
asoiaf,not_removed,its a reference to the way the armor is layered we call it similarly irl
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its just a description of how it looks
asoiaf,not_removed,is it bestiality though if everyone is a chimera
asoiaf,not_removed,still my favorite theory no matter how retarded
asoiaf,not_removed,thats the quickest way to the iron throne it just makes sense
asoiaf,not_removed,if ive spread humour in the world great
asoiaf,not_removed,not sure if rasoiaf or rpolitics
asoiaf,not_removed,which is why it would be a funny view for someone from the far east to have
asoiaf,not_removed,let me guess someone stole your lemon cake
asoiaf,not_removed,it changes colour when you cook them in itask rickard
asoiaf,not_removed,rtheeuron
asoiaf,not_removed,yes definitely on the other side i think westerosi maesters depict yi ti as a messy empire where the emperor barely rules on his own city made of pure gold while outside his walls there are tax collectors imperial generals in a free for all mess all that for me is a blurred vision of a feudal society just like westeros itself my own vision of the far east is somewhat simplistic i dont think there is a great theory about it george has mirrored a lot of stuff of westeros on the far east itself theres even a sorceror lord in carcosa one of the most eastern cities there claiming a crown far essosi euron anyone
asoiaf,not_removed,do you get to the red keep very often oh what an i saying of course you dont
asoiaf,not_removed,lets not make this official outlander move along
asoiaf,not_removed,badum tsss
asoiaf,not_removed,make the iron islands great again miiga
asoiaf,not_removed,regarding carcosadoes anyone know what this is it appears both in awoiaf and true detective i dont believe in a mere coincidence
asoiaf,not_removed,i used to be a kingsguard like you then i took an arakh to the hand
asoiaf,not_removed,you nwah
asoiaf,not_removed,it is a fictional city used by lovecraft associates but coined by ambrose bierce in one of his short stories if i remember correctly its an extradimensional place my take is that later use of the name was to give an otherwordly meaning to whatever context carcosa being the doorway in between for instance in true detective carcosa marks the limit where human reason ends and the otherness begins as in cohles blurred vision of the afterlife when he almost die in the sect place carcosa i believe that in george world carcosa is the frontier its the eastern city that exists even farther east than asshai what lies beyond that frontier is what we truly dont know
asoiaf,not_removed,those horse lords of the grass sea their warriors have curved swords curved swords
asoiaf,not_removed,you need more upvotes
asoiaf,not_removed,i got to thinking maybe im azor ahai and i just dont know it yet
asoiaf,not_removed,assshai city of light city of magic
asoiaf,not_removed,rlj how shitty would it be to have jon die and then the next chapter you learn the truth about his parentage whoops heros dead oh well
asoiaf,not_removed,love this topic so why was it removed two potential reasons the first is not mutually exclusive to the second the first reason is that grrm may not have had a finalized version of the chapter yet he likely had a pretty good draft of the chapter but he may have been polishing the chapter up to the end of his deadline for adwd apparently by late april the second reason is how it interacted with two other chaptersyou mentioned jons final chapter i definitely think bran might have seen jon die and perhaps grrm wanted to keep that ambiguous the other part of it may have been that grrm wanted to keep it somewhat ambiguous about brans role in theons arc in the theon sample we get the birds going crazy at stannis camp tree a raven cried tree tree tree then other bird said theon clear as day as asha came striding through the door take him out across the lake to the islet where the weirwood grows and strike his head off with that sorcerous sword you bear that is how eddard stark would have done it theon slew lord eddards sons give him to lord eddards gods the old gods of the north give him to the tree and suddenly there came a wild thumping as the maesters ravens hopped and flapped inside their cages their black feathers flying as they beat against the bars with loud and raucous caws the tree one squawked the tree the tree whilst the second screamed only theon theon theon theon greyjoy smiled they know my name he thought twow theon i what i think is going on here is that bran is skinchanging the ravens and communicating to both theon and stannis what he or bloodraven wants stannis to do what i suspect they want stannis to use theon as a blood sacrifice maybe to unlock more of brans powers so i think brans chapter was originally going to interplay with the released theon chapter a lot and i think grrm maybe held off on putting it in adwd because it spoiled too much of brans powers and would have been strange having it stand by itself without the theon accompaniment the other possibility is that the opening moves to the battle of winterfell may have been seen by bran as he skinchanged the ravens near stannis camp maybe the birds catch sight of the freys riding for stannis maybe they witness the start of the battle edit i didnt make this explicit yes i think this chapter will end up in twow perhaps side by side with the theon chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,but what a cliffhanger surpassed only by the cliffhanger at the end of two towers imo
asoiaf,not_removed,bold theory it just didnt tonally fit with the end of adwd and despite the information contained therein being important it was cut for that reason
asoiaf,not_removed,there were two parts of the story that were cut from adwd the battle of ice stannis at the crofters village and the battle of fire tyrion in meereen from what i have read the bran chapter that was likely cut is from the battle of ice there is a weirwood tree in the village there are crows all around seems appropriate
asoiaf,not_removed,i strongly believe the bran chapter had something to do with theon and stannis it is heavily implied that bran and probably bloodraven too are warging those ravens and appear to be trying to communicate something to theon or stannis or both i believe the tree the ravens constantly shout is reffering to the weirwood tree at winterfell why i dont know the chapter might be detailing brans involvement in the battle of ice and what bran is trying to accomplish exactly sorry for spelling errors writing this on my phone and in a hurry
asoiaf,not_removed,this is just guessing not really based on actual evidence from the books but i have a feeling it could have something to do with bran seeing something going on with lady stoneheart i dont know exactly why but for a while ive felt that with whatevers going on with stoneheart in twow bran might be watching it through the weirwoods or possibly even be involved in some way maybe hell try successfully or not to communicate with her or witness her doing something that horrifies him maybe the red wedding i also think theon is a pretty likely option as well due to the theon sample chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,that might be a good reason why we have nothing from twow on bran
asoiaf,not_removed,a theory theon has three named chapters in adwd turncloak prince and ghost incidentally all three titles could just as well refer to bran as to theon a wargskinchanger is literally a turncloak bran is the prince of winterfell and when talking to theon through the heart tree bran becomes the ghost of winterfell atm a lot of people are gathered in winterfell some with aligning and some with different agendas many many things are left completely up in the air like the murder of little walder mance and the hooded man and we the reader are left without a pov in winterfell meaning the current setup for the continuation of the winterfell plot is we wait for someone be it stannis of jon to retake winterfell before we get to know more we wait for a pov to arrive unless bran gets his game face on and starts concentrating on whats important to him adwd ended with jon dying or jon astrally displaced or jon well having left the building and we have absolutely no idea what will happen to him because we really still dont know anything about how life and death are connected in these books in the last bran chapter in dance bran sees ned in winterfell leaf warns him not to try and bring back his dad but he wasnt bran just saw him and knew he was there just like when both rickon and bran dreamt that their father was back back in agot so my theory about what the next bran chapter is going to be about is winterfell and how death works bran will through the heart tree be able to let us see the continuation of some of the winterfell plots that would be somewhat less exiting after everyone involved is dead or have been exposed as whatever schemers they may be at the same time it will give us an indication about the finality of death by giving us further hints about the supernatural elements that are moving towards centre stage as jon may not be the only king about to rise and it will be about brans sanity hes just a kid for petes sake once he realizes that death is just a phase oh and i would really like the next bran chapter to be the first named bran chapter thereby indicating that bran is taking over for theon as eyes in winterfell i would call it northnorthwest
asoiaf,not_removed,whoops heros dead oh well im certain this is exactly why he deleted it rlj is obviously significant to the story killing the person we think is the hero only to have a final chapter where his importance is confirmed would basically undermine his death because there is no way wed believe he actually died if we were told right afterwards he was a secret targ there was little doubt he was truly dead but enough to give readers pause nobody knew for sure up until the show beat the books to it but that bran chapter would have given away the goose
asoiaf,not_removed,i like this a lot then he comes back of course
asoiaf,not_removed,to me it seems as if bran wants theon taken to the tree but would it be for a sacrifice i mean that seems like a wonderful pretense to getting theon in front of a weirwood tree where perhaps bran would attempt to communicate with him or stannis in the event bran knows the outcome of the battle most likely about jon but who knows the idea of him knowing about the battle of winterfell is a good idea too
asoiaf,not_removed,fact bryndenbfish loves every topic regarding asoiaf even discussing the character penny runs and hides p
asoiaf,not_removed,the third reason is that the book was too big for massmarket books you can only print so many pages the printers for giant books like the merriamwebster dictionary dont have the capacity to turn out millions of copies
asoiaf,not_removed,agree that bran is skinchanging the ravens in stanniss tower and agree that the battle of ice may be roughly contemporaneous with brans next pov chapter but that may not mean much for the next pov chapter because bran demonstrates in the books and the show that he can interact with people he sees in visions of the past in the book timeline bran will have his greenseer training wheels still firmly attached the battle of ice is important but theon is hardly the first person youd expect him to seek out if his visions are still controlled by his whims he can circle back to stannis et al whenever he wants probably offpage and well just trust that bran was doing all the spooky stuff my guess is he sees jon being stabbed and gets jons backstory from bloodraven either to avoid spoiling rlj or for pacing reasons you dont want to dive back into exposition when youre wrapping things up he left that for the next book
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel ashamed that i cannot remember the ending of that book the movies changed it and have surprisingly taken over in my mind i will need to do a read through again one of these days to make sure the books have the primacy in my mind that they deserve
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed i think parts of it might be too dark even for adwd i dont expect there to be more than or bran chapters in the book and although i agree with ubryndenbfish that he might play a role in the battle of ice i think theres a lot of character growth we have yet to see and they probably wont be super pleasant i think he has to commit one or more transgressions or abominations as haggon could call them before he would willingly ask for the sacrifice of one human to resurrect another i think adwd wasnt ready yet to show us more of a little boys literal descent to hell
asoiaf,not_removed,bran watching his mom from the top of the hollow hill just sounds incredibly sad
asoiaf,not_removed,funnily i think precisely the opposite as long as the mystery is drawn out jon is important if it had been revealed just after his death chances are i would have gone well it was some good irony now lets see who can be the next saviour if not the hidden bastard prince i would have probably become a stannis fan possibly a stannismarriesdaenerys fan
asoiaf,not_removed,wait we confirmed rlj
asoiaf,not_removed,of course guys keep it the fuck down in here im like positive that we accidentally tipped off eitheror dampd and grrm that we had seen cleganebowl in the fires of foil so hbo pulled the rug out from under us with a shitty little tommen scene just before he decides to go for a walk out of of the story of the castle do we really want to have martin throw his arms up in the air and say fuck it they think they know how this shit will all end in my bittersweet fashion ill show them bitter and then just slightly suggest there is sweet coming only to bait amp switch by leaving more bitterness i will not be predicted by these plebs in other words do you want ants because thats how you get ants
asoiaf,not_removed,it could not be more confirmed without us having the book
asoiaf,not_removed,at this point i think it could go either way
asoiaf,not_removed,ive read versions a theory that bran will tell theon stannis about the secret passages which run under winterfell something bran knows about from his time climbing winterfells walls there was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery bran knew about that and he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate climb three floors and run all the way around winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone and then come out on ground level at the north gate with a hundred feet of wall looming over you agot bran ii where the theory falls down imo is that the tunnel that bran knows about runs inside of the castle walls of winterfell as opposed to acting as an entry point from the outside the sacrifice idea falls in line with the idea that blood sacrifice is necessary to awaken greensight and that blood sacrifice against a hearttree was one of the things bran saw in his vision in adwd bran iii then as he watched a bearded man forced a captive down onto his knees before the heart tree a whitehaired woman stepped toward them through a drift of dark red leaves a bronze sickle in her hand no said bran no dont but they could not hear him no more than his father had the woman grabbed the captive by the hair hooked the sickle round his throat and slashed and through the mist of centuries the broken boy could only watch as the mans feet drummed against the earth but as his life flowed out of him in a red tide brandon stark could taste the blood circling back to bran theon and stannis out on the island near stannis camp theres a giant weirwoodheart tree the crofters village stood between two lakes the larger dotted with small wooded islands that punched up through the ice like the frozen fists of some drowned giant from one such island rose a weirwood gnarled and ancient its bole and branches white as the surrounding snows adwd the sacrifice even more ominous heres what asha thinks about the tree eight days ago asha had walked out with aly mormont to have a closer look at its slitted red eyes and bloody mouth it is only sap shed told herself the red sap that flows inside these weirwoods but her eyes were unconvinced seeing was believing and what they saw was frozen blood adwd the sacrifice ive been thinking that this foreshadows the weirwoodheartree acting as a location where a sacrifice will occur in twow theon would make the most sense given his kingsblood and that his execution would have some justification given that theon murdered the millers boys in acok though everyone thinks he murdered bran and rickon
asoiaf,not_removed,i like the theory that northerners believe that a man cannot lie before a heart tree theon then confesses that he didnt murder bran and rickon in front of dozens of northern lords the only evidence for theons complicity in their death is his own word lord toofattoositahorse can back up his claims after the battle and theon keeps his head i know one thing for sure grrm foreshadows asha using theon to challenge the kingsmoot too obviously for him to die in the north
asoiaf,not_removed,if a theon sacrifice is needed could it be his kings blood is the catalyst that brings jon back from death
asoiaf,not_removed,i cant say youll find me chomping at the bit to talk arya in braavos or sam in braavos or braavos same goes for the vale i have my limitations but penny is a fabulous character
asoiaf,not_removed,very true and grrms editor stated that there were two sequences that were cut at the end of adwd finishing this book where he absolutely wanted to end it would have taken probably another year and more pages than could be realistically bound between two covers and so much great stuff had happened already that no one i felt could be unsatisfied by the developments so he voluntarily pulled one big sequence out of the book i lobbied for anotherand it came out too its widely believed that these two sequences were the battles of winterfell and meereen which originally closed out adwd brans chapter would likely have set some of the battle of winterfell up so its likely that this chapter as well as the theon chapter he released in december were in one of those two cuts still i do think jons stabbing and its aftermath would have been witnessed by bloodravenbran skinchanging mormonts raven so its possible grrm cut it for that reason as well
asoiaf,not_removed,lotr book spoiler follows s frodo is dead and sam is the current ringbearer
asoiaf,not_removed,bran comitted of the transgressions didnt he he ate human meat with coldhands in his body and i believe he ate part of a human north of the wall while in summer he has taken over hodor on several occasions he hasnt mated while in anothers skin yet
asoiaf,not_removed,right but by naming him a secret targ the son of rhaegar i think it seems likely that people would go oh jons the prince for sure guess he must not be dead but i guess people could take it as guess this means the prophecy is just a bunch of bullshit like as if the message was that prophecies arent real but they clearly are so i think my situation is pretty likely to happen
asoiaf,not_removed,in the books its technically not been confirmed although id say anyone in doubt now is delusional unless they are now aware of the show with that said were specifically talking about if hypothetically bran had a chapter at the end of dance after jons chapter where they revealed rlj immediately after the j part of that formula gets a few dozen stabbins which was eventually cut from the final draft of dance most likely for the reason i gave above
asoiaf,not_removed,great now we have ants
asoiaf,not_removed,i can totally see grrm using the term plebs in everyday life
asoiaf,not_removed,calm down man grrm doesnt read this sub dd arent straying from their plan based on message boards
asoiaf,not_removed,not really dd got the show because they guessed jons mother correctly hell in the commentary during the toj scene they say this was the question
asoiaf,not_removed,it makes zero sense for them to do something this important differently in the show and books
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps maybe bran needs the sacrifice to awaken jon
asoiaf,not_removed,me finding new stuff here is never ending i have no memory of reading about that sacrifice in brans vision hell i dont know half the stuff in his visions
asoiaf,not_removed,urron goodbrother was the one who redid the kingsmoot right i expect theon to have a pretty big role id be surprised if he was left alive just as a tool for stannis
asoiaf,not_removed,im part of the camp that mel was wrong about kings blood if edric storms blood worked in the leeches i think mel just saw in the fires what names to call or that she got lucky then that means bastards are part of the royal blood since robert wasnt born a king but grandson of the sister daughter of a king then that opens up thousands of characters to be kingsblood if having people believe youre king is what counts excluding wives we have a potential of bran rickon jon sansa arya gendry edric stannis shireen theon aeron victarion euron asha tommen myrcella daeny show cersei jaime i think thats just too much because all of these are directly related to a king not even cousins
asoiaf,not_removed,why the disinterest in braavos if you dont mind me asking
asoiaf,not_removed,i would actually loved to hear what you have to say about penny if you really think shes that interesting but i feel you on the fact that we all have our subplots or even perhaps central character arcs that we just cant make ourselves care about thats totally normal and if i met someone who claimed they found every single chapter in the five published books twow preview samples in the asoiaf series to be super intriguing id call them a damn liar the mature adult i am my personal favorite tertiarytangential character semirelated subplot is the ghost of highheart the issue is that everything there is to know about her is like easily summarized in a small paragraph anything else would be pure conjecture i guess i just lose it when i reread the chapter where it describes her wanting the brotherhood to play jennys song and he she closes her eyes and cradles back and forth sobbing while singing along thats a devastating routine to put yourself through on a regular basis i am a musiciansongwriter for fun and have been payingmaking music for about years as a hobby etc its one thing to play a sad song that you personally arent emotionally connected to but you try to put yourself in the songwriters state of mind i guess actually playing something that hits very strong nerves in yourself or someone else is very uncomfortable the fact that tom plays for her happily makes happy and sad all the same because im not sure if the gohh is crying out of misery or happiness or both but her radical shift in mood towards arya whatever slight was perceived in that bizarre interaction is pretty fascinating to me you dont use strong words specific words such as those to some child you dont know not even in asoiaf would that be totally normal sowhats her deal did arya do something or is what she will do next time shes in the riverlands thats my jam everyone has something they get extra amped about oh and least interesting things to me are pretty much all of grifffaegon chapters in dance that have him directly there through tyrion or joncons pov etc the epilogue of dance is fine hes only mentioned and i am on the hes a fake side of the discussion but it doesnt matter really and i suppose thats the point i cant find myself to enjoy anything about joncon aegon because i really dont care for rhaegar and i never have throughout the entire series when hes mentioned ive remained strongly under the impression that he was a far shittier guy that everyone celebrates him to have been whereas euron is actually a livingcurrent character that is indefensible in every way yet the forsaken chapter made of this forum think hes a jack sparrow with super magic powers or something no man hes a horrible person like gregor clegane iswas maybe worse why are you all rooting for him why didnt you root for joffrey against nedhouse stark or the mountain against oberyn because euron is just as terrible or worse rant
asoiaf,not_removed,so what youre basically saying is that there were two huge things that were cut from adwd and that are more than likely going to be in twow meaning that he mustve had some of that book written all the way back then also possibly meaning that theres no way that the series is going to be finished in two books
asoiaf,not_removed,oh shit thats right thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,he certainly has but the way i see brans arch in twow is roughly brans new abilities slowly make him greed for more power and does bad things in the process he has to make a difficult choice leave the cave and give up on infinite power for the greater good weve also already seen bran tempted to confort meera while in hodors skin which could maybe be a equivalent of matin while in wolf skin one thing we havent seen him do yet and that is also in varamyrs chapter is killing while in summer and stealing a skinchangers second life
asoiaf,not_removed,lyannnnnaaa
asoiaf,not_removed,lannnnaaaa
asoiaf,not_removed,im no expert but im positive he was joking
asoiaf,not_removed,but ubryndenbfish posted in this very thread s
asoiaf,not_removed,oh i should have put an s im bad with this kinda stuff sometimes because certain subs assume stuff like my allcaps hysteria must be sarcasm while others are more used to people being serious my mistake but i assure you i am calm gawd damnit rahhhhh as walter would say from the big lebowski calmer than you are
asoiaf,not_removed,strickly speaking we dont know if they actually got it right just that they gave an answer and george agreed as far as we know they said that rlj and the information we had at the time backed the theory disclaimer i do believe that rlj
asoiaf,not_removed,right but there are some folks who think that just because they have made changes to the show much larger ones more recently but thats expected when the literal source material ink runs dry you know that only more changes will occur in the last two seasons and i guess these folks think theyll be much much larger differences because they assume its correlated in an exponential way to the lack of book material to draw from i understand that this makes no fucking sense because we know they have almost a constant open line of dialogue with grrm regarding the remaining storylines however i think theyve said that those discussions have already taken place like a while ago any further discussions i assume would just be confirming how they carry out or fine tune the details of the the way they are abridging their adapted series
asoiaf,not_removed,theons death giving life to jon would be a kind of atonement his last hope at any kind of redemption
asoiaf,not_removed,broadlyspeaking i think that fantasy venice is overdone in the fantasy genre i understand why people enjoy braavos and the history behind it as an antislaveryantivalyrian city its not my cup of tea though i cant quite put my finger on it but theres something about braavos which seems almost artificial in the world compared to places that grrm explores in the rest of asoiaf in terms of new interesting places explored in feastdance ill take sunspear the water gardens or volantis any day over braavos
asoiaf,not_removed,you should write about the ghost of high heart in a post my friend and how interesting on not liking young griffjoncon chapters i find them the highlight of adwd heck i wrote a series of essays exploring how i think their arc will unfold in twowados
asoiaf,not_removed,danger zone
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly this isnt even on my sarcasm detection the level of posting in this sub lead me to my conclusion the bold should have helped me out but that isnt too far from your avg rasoiaf post
asoiaf,not_removed,or like that line from boondock saints i will not calm down you start freaking out
asoiaf,not_removed,the last thing you should ever do is explain a joke if somebody needs it explained they probably wont think its funny anyway besides were able to detect your sarcasm oh one more thingi am not at all positive that dd are unaware of fandom theories it doesnt feel realistic to believe that they couldntwouldnt troll the fandom there are about on this sub alone idk his many the got sub has are we to believe they havent noticed they dont use the internet
asoiaf,not_removed,however i think theyve said that those discussions have already taken place like a while ago prior to writing season they spent like a week with grrm getting detailed outlines of character arcs and future events that said as they moved past book events theyve also been very reluctant to comment on what is or isnt taken directly from what grrm has given them since that would essentially constitute spoilers for both the books and the show i would think that any comments about current discussions with grrm would fall under the same umbrella of silence more or less the only things they have definitely confirmed were shireen and hodor the former confirmed in more or less a please dont lynch us grrm told us to do it moment
asoiaf,not_removed,hi there im catalyst the author of the aforementioned comment or how i learned to abandon all hope of twow getting published and learned to love being impatient thats a dr strangelove shoutout to be clear i dont want to take any more chances here lol i noticed you wrote the following the level of posting in this sub lead me to my conclusion the bold should have helped me out but that isnt too far from your avg rasoiaf post with respect to that remark i want to preface my question by saying i absolutely agree with you to an extent over the last years in this subreddit more specifically over the past years there has been an influx of users with little to no experience reading the books or have just begun to read the books i assume their logic is that because the show finally eclipsed virtually every single part of the book material which tons of websites and viral articles wrote about to inform show only folks prior to season airing that its totally a great idea to hop in this subreddit its not without reading the books first my question is this how long have you been a subscriberregular visitor of this community rough estimation of course i assure you that my intention is not so that i can feel smug or judge you or any other user if youve only been a member of the subreddit for a relatively short amount of time compared to many other regulars in here that is not what im about an its a dick thing to do i do however think your comment remark i quoted above is pretty understandable im just trying to get a better idea of where youre coming from so yeah sorry i wrote this novel lengthed comment the tldr of what im trying to say is that about years ago when i first joined this subreddit i was a refugee fleeing from gameofthrones and had just completed my first readthrough of the books and had not yet aired it was a very different community back then not better not worse lets not even get into that guys please so it was pretty much dead serious for the most part with the occasional highbrow joke in the comments that had cleverly used asoiaf terminology or narrative reference for the sake of a laugh but that was about it somewhere between then and about or years ago adwd had been out for a few years and fans on rererereads were getting ballsdeep into some tin foil predications really outthere stuff the kind where youd give a ಠಠ and think what the fuck are you smoking preson this isnt a sciencefiction novel ffs stop it the rapid influx and migration of users from the gameofthrones subreddit was immediately obvious when season debuted as the entire tone and expected standard for every post in this subreddit was diluted substantially now this could be due to the shows megarise to mainstream pop culture godtier status which would explain all of the posts you see in here each day that wouldnt have been given the time of day in the first few years after adwds release or it could just be that all of the fans book show alike all of us are just completely out of book material to pull data out of and explore as a potentially undiscovered theme reference foreshadowing or explanation for some random event in history etc i think its probably the latter but i hope this all helps explain why you should expect more nonserious discussion threads in here until twow is published well should quell the masses for a while but it will also make twow wait all the more frustrating cheers and thank you again if you managed to read this entire comment i know i know im verbose but you aint seen nothing yet ಠ◡ಠ
asoiaf,not_removed,when i reread my comment explaining the sarcasm once i posted it a habit i use to check for spellinggrammar errors i didnt even finish the first part where i mentioned the super specific before laughing out loud im not sure how dropping that number so casually about something like this seemed totally normal not to harp on the user for getting whooshed by a joke but that should have been the biggest red flag that i was on a roflcopter edit i absolutely do believe yes in all seriousness that out of everyone involved in the asoiaf series adaptation which is a fuckton at least grrm and the main hbo showrunners dd are aware of the most popular fan forums online and the type of foil that gets tossed around do i think any of those three guys regularly or routinely check this subreddit which is a major fan forum and for years has been one of if not the most concentrated amount of quality fan discussion or a few of the other popular forums to see if they are dodging predictions or living up to the fandoms impossibly high standards fuck no do i think theyve seen this subreddit at least once maybe a few times or stop by randomly every year or so its more than likely if its not dd themselves doing a cursory glance at the nerdcorners of the asoiaf internet discussion forums to be clear this excludes anyall youtube channels because their comment sections are atrocious its at least their assistants or some intern who doesnt realize how lame of an assignment it is etc i dont think they check on fan sites to see if theyre living up to our standards or being celebrated i think they just want to get an overall understanding of broader fanbase reactions to their adapted series for instance im sure theyve learned by now that dorne was bad and they should feel bad or they always knew it would be due to allocating so many writers and resources across the world just to film a ridiculously highproduction show in less than a year martin is all about lj and if weve learned anything about reading his comment section on notablog its that hed sooner write twow and ados than spend his time obsessing over the most trivial type of fan post just to be like how did they not understand that i meant hot pie to be the prince that was promised ahhhhh i need to go to the hugos or watch the puppy bowl now fuck being an author rahhhh hahah you know like martin gives zero fucks about an anonymous internet fans because i think he knows the internet is dark and full of trolls not much else like if grrm had some random account for a fan forum like this subreddit where he occasionally logs on and if he sees thousands of fans all agreeing with a post that is in reality just a total misinterpretation of his work but then as this random user starts trying to get people to follow his breadcrumbs and reach the rightintended conclusion that would just be sadand it would infuriate me thats our job not his let us obsess over the stupid details because obviously were right about them and so its all good why are you still reading this go outside unless its dark bring a flashlight or dont your funeral
asoiaf,not_removed,tldr i forgot that i was speaking to a fantasy fandom who apparently also believe in fairy tales read on only if you dont believe every cute little story otherwise dont bother the gaping hole in the narrative is that grrm would give his baby to a couple guys by placing so much weight on that question im going to guess that its a nice true story they all tell but they would have gotten the rights to create it anyway based upon everything else they discussed in the hours they met with him of course i cant prove thatit just feels more rational and likely or im crazy and a respected author made the decision to hand over his magnum opus to two men based solely on the fact that they read the books and paid attention
asoiaf,not_removed,you may be my new favourite user on this sub i like your style
asoiaf,not_removed,you need to sort your shit out
asoiaf,not_removed,i found one nah but really ive been in here for like half a dozen years now but i suppose i didnt start commenting regularly and without any sort of filter or censor on what i say i call it thought vomit those who know memy username around the subs i spend the most time in andor moderate know me as a very verbose person it doesnt usually attract any positive responses in terms of my chatty freestyle form of posting my thoughts in various threads i get a lot of tldr but now that you mention it rasoiaf has always been pretty chill about my walls of text that leap from topic to topic within just a few words sometimes which makes sense i suppose were used to reading other users not to mention grrms unabridged magnum opus installments etc posts theories neverending chains of comment squabbles and everything in between brevity is virtually banished from this subreddit and it explains why i often feel super chill to speak my mind here tldr i know im a good user to followread youre welcome keep on keepin on
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe that it was cercei that said joffrey hated sansa because of that argument at the trident where arya beat up joffrey and threw his sword in the river he never did get over the humiliation and dealt with it by abusing sansa there was no reason yet for him to abuse margery but in any case it would have been far more difficult when the tyrells were essential to keeping the throne but i have no doubt hed show his true colours in time
asoiaf,not_removed,being gracious to the new toy in front of the discarded toy was part of the abuse piled on sansa probably not tenable longterm i meanmargaery was often able to curb his psychotic side with the public eye as leverage but stomping out a thousand thousand joffrey shitfires with a smile is probably beyond even her capabilities and patience any inkling that she finds him anything but perfect and shes a thorn in his twitchy little ego just like sansa
asoiaf,not_removed,would joffrey had treated margaery with the same apathy that he treated sansa when bobby b was alive i dont think joff was apathetic to her he was taking her out on trips just the two of them and etc sure its no master level seduction but remember that in the book theyre both young and this is their first attempts at romance sansa has readlistened to a lot of stories but its not the same thing would joffrey had treated margaery with the rude antagonism that he treated sansa had the girls roles been swapped if the tyrells had rebelled the same way the starks did yes he would have been equally abusive to margaery i think what killed joffsan or whatever their couple nickname was was that everyone in her family was antagonistic to him her sister stabbed him and used her magically bounded wolf against him her father tried to steal his throne adding insult to injury by spreading lies that he was a bastard her brother robb supported by the rest of his family rebelled taking away two of his regions and began a war against him no matter how strong your relationship is thats going to put serious pressure on it
asoiaf,not_removed,im betting joffrey was just playing nice so he could wait for the perfect moment to do something unbelievably cruel to margaery the same way he did with sansa in a game of thrones as stupid and psychotic as joffrey is hes usually smart enough to realize that he has his role to play in the game too like his mother hes able to put on the veneer of sweet wholesome royalty once margaery was married to him and the tyrells became legally bound to the lannisters he probably would have started tormenting her just like sansa hell maybe the only reason he didnt start in on margaery right away was because he felt he wasnt done with sansa yet
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its more of cerseis lessons reynes and so
asoiaf,not_removed,i have a sudden urge to play crusader kings agot mod and expand the westerlands up to the green fork
asoiaf,not_removed,very nice idea have an upvote i think the area south of the trident eg harrenhall etc should probably go to the crownlands rather than the vale as should the area to the east of the gods eye river rather than to the westerlands that way the crown will get its piece of the action from the partitioning plus it will limit the growth of the valewesterlands rather than letting them have everything although you could argue that the westerlands is favoured in this arrangement so maybe extend the reach into the area to the west of the gods eye or annex that territory to an expanded crownlands if you dont want highgarden getting any bigger
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think the vale would control anything outside of its massive natural boundary except maybe some islands to the west or north the time it would take to travel around the mountains to govern the towns north would just be rather prohibitive i think what will happen realistically if some division were to happen is that the north would come down and a take the twins i dont think riverrun will mind so much as they will possibly be taking everything to the west
asoiaf,not_removed,why does the eyrie get any part of the riverlands
asoiaf,not_removed,why would the riverlands be partitioned
asoiaf,not_removed,tywin is that you lannisters seriously make out in this scenario
asoiaf,not_removed,the twins appears to sit dead on the border who would control it
asoiaf,not_removed,would this be after aegons conquest or the war of five kings that makes a big difference imo
asoiaf,not_removed,make everything north of oldstones part of the vale proper and their territory looks like a duck facing the sunset sea
asoiaf,not_removed,wow i never noticed how centrally located harrenhal was i always assumed it was close to the westerlands
asoiaf,not_removed,that mod gets stale after awhile so i set blobbing goals got my play throughs my favorite is playing the north and taking the northern riverlands from the tullyshoares and the sisters from the vale
asoiaf,not_removed,in agreement with your first paragraph addendum id make the green fork the dividing line between eyrie and westerlands gives more land to the houses of seagard oldstones and fairmarket
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel like they wouldnt even really want any lands outside of what they have i mean theyre protected by a huge wall of mountains and then suddenly they have to protect lands on the outside of that
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i dont get that either i feel like the south of the neck would be easier and more valuable to control from the north the arryns are famous for sticking between the mountains vales and controlling land like that which is so different from their power base would not seem feasible
asoiaf,not_removed,well they are situated between larger and more powerful dominions and dont have a lot of natural barriers theyve historically been dominated by stormlanders iron islanders and others iirc theyre a little like historical poland which also got partitioned thrice before reemerging after wwi
asoiaf,not_removed,its just a fun idea
asoiaf,not_removed,its a cool whatif what if aegon just split up the riverlands instead of giving it to the tullys what if the iron throne punished the tullys by removing the kingdom and partitioning it to other lords paramount
asoiaf,not_removed,seaguard exists to guard the west from the iron islanders
asoiaf,not_removed,it looks like the western side is controlled by the lannisters and the eastern side is controlled by the arryns im not really sure how thats supposed to work seems more like a gatetype situation for either house
asoiaf,not_removed,probably the freys
asoiaf,not_removed,the crown to prevent conflict and increase tax base
asoiaf,not_removed,the twins are not a keep but two keeps set on opposite sides of the river banks thus control could be split
asoiaf,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikighajar
asoiaf,not_removed,your comment contains uncovered spoilers please edit your comment to insert spoiler code heres how s type spoilers here it will show up as s type spoilers here thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,never gets stale my man you just arent doing it right
asoiaf,not_removed,id say its the one of the first modgames ive played where i can see it getting stale there are so many options to do that i never get bored the best though as playing as some weak house in westeros and trying to make your way to the top
asoiaf,not_removed,id make the green fork the dividing line between eyrie and westerlands gives more land to the houses of seagard oldstones and fairmarket yeah that was my first instinct as it makes the seaguard strip very narrow i decided against it basically because the westerlands have already grown considerably and given the reductions i was making to the vales territory in favour of the crownlands i thought it was best to keep the border at the bluefork although if we could take land from the westerlands elsewhere eg the region to the east of stony sept then the greenfork might be a better bet as the northerncentral line
asoiaf,not_removed,give the last of the neck to the ironborn ie the land before the continent widens but do we want to encourage the ironborn though and give them a jumping off point for future troublemaking in central westeros or are you thinking that by giving them the land we can essentially wed them to a more peaceful situation ie the new territory might help solve some of the ironborns land issues
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont believe i said anything about the westerlands or who should take what
asoiaf,not_removed,poor polen
asoiaf,not_removed,but they are still only one house who would they be bannerman to arryns or lannisters i mean they are freys and that doesnt matter to them but still
asoiaf,not_removed,why are you assuming this is after the war of the five kings it makes the most sense that this would happen after the conquest as a whatif situation there would be no reason to remove an administrative zone after hundreds of years of its existence
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah the key is challenging yourself i stopped playing as emperor tier charactersking of iron throne and strictly start with a single county and try and grow from there my current favorite playthrough is as house celtigar from claw isle during the crowned stag bookmark after robert dies and pretty much most baratheons afterwards i now am pretty much the tywin lannister of the game still in progress a less successful play through i had was as house forrester during the war of the five kings im given the high lordship of skaggs right off the bat and stupid robb fails to stop the ironborn from capturing the north i lose ironrath and forced to start over from scratch as a tribal in skagos worst playthrough ever
asoiaf,not_removed,ah youre right theres lots to do prob at least of my hours on was on this mod lol just that after doing playthroughs of over hours the flavor gets boring so i just do a bunch of playthroughs with specific goals now my favorite was definitely shattered realm mod as the redwynes becoming king of the vine and tower oldtown arbor then king of the reach then forming the it after blobbing a lot felt great i miss that family
asoiaf,not_removed,it would depend on when we were partitioning it youre not encouraging them youre treating them fairly by including them in the partition do you really think its smart to tell the ironborn were cutting up the riverlands and you get jack shit that would not go over well the most recent holder of the riverlands before aegon conquered it and then gave it away was the ironborn not giving them a part of the land would all but guarantee rebellion
asoiaf,not_removed,poland is not yet lost
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah there is just so much you can do one of my best games every i started as aegon before the conquest and took all but the north dorne and the iron islanda from my vassals and gave them to targs the game lasted for years before the mod updated and i lost it
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think ive ever played as anything higher than a count i feel it would be too easy otherwise
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree with long playthrough getting boring i tend to set goals like you and then start with a new house stays fun that way
asoiaf,not_removed,the ironborn deserve no fairness they contribute nothing to westeros but destruction their culture is about stealing people and food and riches from the greenlands that would not go over well who cares what they think they have no respect for the laws of the king or for human beings generally not giving them a part of the land would all but guarantee rebellion so does doing nothing thats their thing theres no reason to give them part of the mainland which would make their future conquests that much easier
asoiaf,not_removed,i hadnt said anything about that either only that it doesnt make sense to give it to the vale after they spent the war huddled behind the gates of the moon youre really stretching to make a lot of weird assumptions about what i said and didnt say but to answer your question i dont know why the riverlands would need to be partitioned in the first place the riverlands were granted to littlefinger as warden and house frey as lords of riverrun which pretty much destroys the need to partition anything at all but if it were partitioned granting the riverlands to the westerlands makes most sense right of conquest followed by the crownlands then the reach
asoiaf,not_removed,i started as the tollets and expanded to own all of westeros and a vast majority of essos before the game would just crash
asoiaf,not_removed,lol not since harren hoare who was conquered by aegon who handed the riverlands to house tully then the riverlands were finally conquered by the lannisters remember that time that jaime lannister sent edmure tully into riverrun to end the siege yeah that was also a conquest so the order of conquests as if that matters goes something like house mudd house justman house teague house durrandon house hoare house targaryen then house lannister may not be in order the ironborn hadnt been there and victorious for over years you need to read through the books again
asoiaf,not_removed,and thats all the proof i need that youre just bullshitting they used military force to seize lands thats a conquest the us has not used arms to seize land that way and i dont know after what conquest youre talking about
asoiaf,not_removed,they dont have to actually annex the land to make it a conquest they just brought it back into the fold by collapsing house tully and bringing in house frey it doesnt matter whose troops were used either what matters is that they used force of arms to take the land and give it to someone else youre jumping through a lot of hoops to make sense of your theory hell i cant even make sense of some of what youre talking about what conquest are you talking about seeing written down are you talking about aegons conquest cuz guess what he didnt keep the land for himself or use his own troops so that wasnt a conquest either by your definition and speaking of definitions con•quest noun the subjugation and assumption of control of a place or people by use of military force
asoiaf,not_removed,the lannisters didnt subjugate and assume control of the riverlands they attempted to but failed when robb came south then robb died and edmure the lord of riverrun was taken prisoner and exchanged for control of riverrun it didnt end with robb then the crown using lannister and frey forces doesnt matter whose forces were used regained control of its own lands from rebels it doesnt matter again the definition is simply the subjugation and assumption of control of a place or people by use of military force the riverlanders were loyal to house tully house tully was destroyed by force of arms now the riverlanders bend the knee to the crown that makes it a conquest did daeron conquer half of westeros when his forces defeated the blackfyre rebellion yes he secured the loyalty of the people by force of arms my definition is the official one aegon did subjugate the riverlands he made them his by using military force to kill the ruler of the riverlands and then allowed the tullys to be his lord paramount of the riverlands you mean like how the forces nominally under tommen subjugated the riverlands and allowed petyr baelish to be his lord paramount same dish different flavor do you not understand that the lords dont actually own their land its all property of the crown the crown just lets them use it in exchange for being a vassal thats not true the crown has no power without its vassals which is why joffrey wanted a standing royal army and the various lords own and maintain their lands and laws on behalf of the crown which doesnt have the power projection even in medieval europe properties were returned to the crown following a successful attainder you may be technically correct as the sovereign has ultimate authority but in practice no noblemen rebel and thats the last second im going to spend arguing with you about it
asoiaf,not_removed,thats because i wasnt talking about aegons conquest except in reference to what you were saying
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah im done talking to you youre all over the place you only listen enough to respond and im not going to keep fighting to be heard
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think his choices in acok have much to do with love at all theon is living in a delusion that hes just the greatest and owed something big by the world and he sets out to prove with actions and choices that get increasingly idiotic as he goes along cersei is in fact probably the closest of all the other povs to prereek theon when he goes to pyke its to claim his position as the future king of the iron islands thats all he thinks about in his first chapters and i think its this wish above anything else that makes him go along with balons plans its him clinging on to his dream of being a future king after humiliation even if it means invading the north and its this desire to prove himself as quickly as possible that makes him hatch this insane plan of taking winterfell that he manages to pull off somehow too along the way he makes the weirdest mental gymnastics to convince himself that hes not actually betraying robb something along the lines of robb will be king of the riverlands so theon is totally entitled to the north and that hes totally a lord in the vein of ned stark while being the exact opposite his desire to become a king himself overrules and clouds everything making him even hate his own sister another case against choosing family over honor and eventually everything he does goes tits up in a monumental fashion until all hes left is a final suicidal stance but even that is taken from him quick edit thats not to say that his situation after arriving at pyke wasnt super weird but i dont think he ever made a choice for greyjoy over stark not really he made a choice for theon future king
asoiaf,not_removed,theon was not doing it for his family he was doing it for himself he wanted to impress his family and the ironborn theon wants badly to belong and lacks confidence in himself he can never be a stark and the greyjoys view him as tainted he hoped to at least get the ironborns respect as with most people that feel this way they have a habit of doing foolish things to impress as his uncle later mentions to aeron taking a place is far easier than holding it theon ignores advice and foolishly tries to hold something he cannot hold if theon had followed the original plan he would be king of the iron isle and he would have the respect of his family and country men
asoiaf,not_removed,his motivation wasnt love or honorduty it was insecurity he felt no true place in the world had no true identity he wasnt truly kracken or direwolf he was searching for a sense of belonging and worth and sought to fill that void with winterfellto finally be a stark to finally be kin through conquest hes an interesting mirror to jon who had similar feelings of not belonging or having a true sense of worth to stand on jon however instead of seeking his worth in the approval of others carves out a place for himself in the world on his own merits it is ironic that the one place you can construct your own self on your own actions is in the nights watch which theon rejected as a way out of his predicament
asoiaf,not_removed,theons plan to take winterfell was a good and he executed it well if he had sacked it burned it and returned with loot hostages he would have been a hero to the ironborn his need to be respected and regarded as the prince of winterfell caused him to attempt to hold winterfell his sentimentality cause him to be merciful to the common folk instead of letting him men rapekillplunder that caused him to lose control also plot george needed to have a few things set up and theon was a good catalyst to do it
asoiaf,not_removed,theon is a very complicated character when i first read the books i couldnt stand him he betrayed the starks twice over killed some orphan kids which could easily be his own and then he didnt even tell mance spearwives that arya was a fake but then a friend pointed out theon just wants to be liked and that changed my entire perspective at the end of the day he has no true home robb might have treated him like a brother and ned a son but he still was a hostage he still didnt have the full trust of catelyn and when he finally gets home to the family he hasnt seen in years his father is embarrassed by him and his sister mocks him multiple times he had to take winterfell to prove himself to not be a laughingstock but i dont think he wanted to go as deep as he ended up getting bringing back bran rickon to his father would have condemned them to death which was why he didnt do it things spiraled out of control and he did eventually kill some kids in order to not be such a walking joke
asoiaf,not_removed,this is interesting but it forgets the love theon had for robb although he was technically a prisoner of the starks theon was raised like family i dont disagree that he was in an impossible dilemma when his natural father told him to betray is metaphorical brother robb truly a loselose situation for him however there were elements honor love and duty at play on either side of his decision to either support or betray robb
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree we should be more sympathetic to him it was only because of his dad that he sided against the north and taking winterfell was more because of dreams he had then his ideas he was more of a puppet when it came to that
asoiaf,not_removed,the show nailed theons heartbreak best when he tells ramsay that he made a horrible decision and his true father died in kings landing
asoiaf,not_removed,if anything he has a love for the starks but a duty to his family
asoiaf,not_removed,i find it hard to believe that theon didnt think about taking bran and rickon to the iron islands its the first thing asha points out to theon telling him he could have won them the war the thing is theon did deep down love the starks he knew that taking rickon and bran to his bloodthirsty father would of most likely ended up killing them both he pretends to be a man he truly isnt its like he was a kracken on the outside and a wolf on the inside kind of parallels later how he becomes reek outwardly but deep down is still theon
asoiaf,not_removed,there is a difference between loyalty to a noble family as in stannis backing his brother and loyalty to an ignoble family as is the case with theon capturing winterfell for his fathers campaign there is nothing kingly about balon and no reasonable justification for his war his claim and his plan are ridiculous balon sees this as a sort of blood feud with the starks but the reality is balon put his kin into a fatal position by making idiotic decisions as a ruler and leaving the rest of the realm no choice but to fight them if anything ned did everything he could to minimize the blood with the greyjoys by taking theon to ward as terms for peace rather than conquering the isles outright the second greyjoy rebellion is a betrayal of the leniency shown at the end of the first rebellion and a betrayal of theons generous upbringing
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei is in fact probably the closest of all the other povs to prereek theon same with viserys id say
asoiaf,not_removed,theon is living in a delusion that hes just the greatest and owed something big by the world and he sets out to prove with actions and choices that get increasingly idiotic as he goes along theon has built up this delusion as a coping mechanism though in reality hes a scared lonely little boy who was stolen from his family by a scary king and left in the care of an honourable man lets think about it theon is brought to winterfell when hes what robb and jon are at the time so hes older by some years hes old enough to understand what has happened his father rebelled lost a war and his punishment was that his son would be a hostage now i do not see ned as the kind of guy who would remind a young hostage that if his selfish moronic father rebels again he will be killed but would everyone in winterfell have kept that thought to themselves what about all the northern men who served in neds armies in the greyjoy rebellion what about the guys angry at the fuckwit iron islanders who killed their mates and raided their home villages they might remind theon about this every week of his life in winterfell theon describes to maester luwin that the noose of his hostage situation in winterfell chafed him chafed him raw theon is smart enough to know that he had a good deal ned was kind to him treated him as a foster ward rather than a hostage but no amount of honey to the deal could change its terms theon always knew that he was a hostage to his familys behaviour thats some pretty serious shit to grow up with on your plate on top of god knows whatever fuckery resulted from being raised by the asshole pirates of dickhead islands in the first place so theon develops this cocky arrogant self image to compensate for his hostage status hes neds ward not his hostage hes the last son of balon greyjoy the heir to the iron islands conveniently ignoring or forgetting all that he was ever taught about the iron price and a ship captain being king of his ship hes the oldest of the boys at winterfell he gets to show robb and jon how to be a man ie by fucking whores in winters town he has the freedom of being a highborn foster ward to roam around and do as he pleases he doesnt have to listen to lectures about how to run winterfell or any other nobles keep like robb and sansa do he doesnt have the social taint of bastardy as jon snow does in agot theon is eager to prove himself worthy of trust he volunteers to go to kings landing when cat finds the dagger now whats also interesting here is that while cat later says that theon cannot be trusted she herself brought theon into a very secret very serious conversation between herself robb and rodrick cassel theon is an integral part of the winterfell household theyve become accustomed to theon as this slightly annoyingly cocky and wayward foster brother then when robb calls his banners theon fights alongside him like a brother then the northern lords decide to crown robb dakingindanorf what does theon ask robb to confirm before he also pledges himself to the northern kingdom am i your brother now and always theon needs that validation that hes useful and hes loved by the starks then in acok he gets the idea that he should be robbs envoy to the iron islands now in all fairness i think theon went to pyke in good faith to be robbs envoy but once he got home all that shit he buried about being taken away from his family plus being overtly rejected by not just his father and sister but his entire culture the cocky self image that theon created as a safety bubble to deal with being removed from his home as a child is suddenly shattered does theon make terrible decisions sure but are his actions illogical no theyre the actions of someone desperate to belong he keeps being reminded that hes not really a northerner even though cat trusted him to tell him about her suspicions around brans fall she didnt trust him to be an envoy for robb that chafed robbs blithely ignorant to the obsessive need that his big brother has to be respected and to have a home hes survived his childhood by telling himself that he is special then he gets home and finds out he really isnt special in fact his home culture hate him because they think hes been tainted by his time in winterfell so he goes off and tries to prove himself a true son of balon greyjoy and ned stark he tries to capture winterfell like a greyjoy but then tries to rule it as a stark and fails at both one of the saddest lines about theon is when asha visits him at winterfell dont die so far from the sea little brother tldr theon had been dying so far from the sea for a very long time and kept himself afloat by inventing a version of reality where he was super special when that bubble was burst by cold hard reality he lashed out and did stupid shit
asoiaf,not_removed,good points he is focused on being king i wouldnt say he doesnt care about his family though i think the decision to take winterfell hinges on the fact that his family isnt like the starks if it was neds heir who came back to him after years i dont think ned would criticize him like balon did theon wanted to be a stark but couldnt and when he realized the greyjoys werent the starks he felt alone and that he needed to focus on himself
asoiaf,not_removed,his desire to become a king himself overrules and clouds everything making him even hate his own sister another case against choosing family over honor to be fair asha is a total bitch to him he hasnt seen her in years and the first thing she does is try to trick him then she makes fun of him multiple times then hes assigned some crappy ship raiding fishing villages while she is taking a decently sized castle and then even in winterfell she starts making fun of him in front of his own troops
asoiaf,not_removed,i know that his plan to take winterfell and hold it was wrong but i dont blame him for betraying robb he proceeds to fuck up for his family though thats just poor judgment and planning on his part he wants to impress his family too much
asoiaf,not_removed,insecurity is a good word i guess its not a love for family as much as it was a combination of being jealous of the stark family where robb who became the lord of winterfell and king in the north absolutely loved even his bastard brother jon snow theon maybe didnt love his family but he wanted to have that family love but he didnt know how to process those emotions and his family isnt one that loves one another after balon dies and theon becomes captured it becomes asha vs euron vs aeron with all three of them taking advantage of the fact that victarion is an idiot and using him for their own ends the greyjoy family is one that seems incapable of love though asha does love her mother and that side of the family theon is a boyman who wants to be loved instead of reacting to this in a healthy way he makes selfdestructive decisions hoping to gain glory and his familys respect
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree i dont think he understood his family the way he thought he did if he would have been able to bring ned starks sons to balon his father might have given him the respect he craved so much he forgets his house words we do no sow if he just took them and regrouped with ashago back to pyke balon might see him as a worthy heir
asoiaf,not_removed,theon did love robb but i think he really needed a father figure in his life and thats what he yearned for more than anything in the show theon talks about how his real father died in kings landing but in the books ned was not a father figure to theon because he knew that theon being a hostage meant that he might have to use his life as leverage he wanted balon to treat him like a son and not an outsider
asoiaf,not_removed,rob clearly didnt understand the greyjoy family or the purpose of theon being with the starks in the first place and let his familiar relationship with him get in the way yes this is another example of ned and cat failing to adequately prepare their older children for the reality of the world that they lived in robb is the heir to winterfell yet cannot accept the fact that his foster brother is actually a hostage to balon greyjoys good behaviour this should have been drummed in to robb from the moment he was old enough to understand the lessons about lordship of which he clearly had some based on how well he was able to step into the role of lord of winterfell at cat herself is inconsistent with robb and how to treat theon she considers theon a trusted member of their family in agot when she includes theon in the super secret godswood powwow about her suspicions about the assassination attempt on bran but then she tells robb in acok dont send theon to pyke as an envoy he cant be trusted hes a greyjoy yet cat herself saw the sense in her being an envoy of robbs to the baratheon brothers robb was just doing the next logical thing sending his brother to treat with balon greyjoy you cant have it both ways cat and ned you cant tell robb to treat theon as a trusted brother but then at the last minute say no he cant be trusted hes an asshole pirate of dickhead islands are you kidding me robbs poor judgement is a direct result of his parents failing to clue him into the political realities of the seven kingdoms and while there seems to be some tension between theon and jon this is as much about personalities as it is about roles was jon subconsciously jealous of this stranger who came into their home when he was young and became robbs other brotherfromanothermother ditto did theon dislike this other notquitestark boy in the household as a rival for robbs brotherly affections when jon theon robb and bran accompany ned out to execute the nights watch deserter we see the family dynamics robb is there as the heir to learn bran is there as the spare to learn as well theon is there as the ward to effectively squire for ned and jon is part of the household cavalry slightly above jory cassel and his cohorts but not quite part of the inner sanctum either did this mean that theon had a more privileged position within the hierarchy of winterfell than jon as hes allowed more ceremonial roles at official functions like this similarly think about book jons bitterness at the feast for robert he the bastard is seated below the salt but theon is allowed to dress in fine clothes marked with the greyjoy sigil and escort sansa into the dining hall and dine at the main table with the stark family and the royals jon and theons dislike for each other is partly about their personalities clashing but its also a lot to do with their relative social status within winterfell jon was the bastard with no place while theon was a noble hostage with a place sansa is entering the age where ned and cat will have to think about marriage contracts and alliances yet shes still allowed to view the world in this entirely childish knightsandladies storybook way did ned intend to marry sansa to theon to ensure that theon would not go back to the old ways of the iron born after balon died and theon took over pyke is that why ned was caught so on the hop by roberts obvious suggestion that sansa marry joffrey i mean seriously guys who did you think your very eligible maiden daughter was going to marry ned and cat are living proof that the children of lords paramount do not marry for love so what was the plan
asoiaf,not_removed,id really disagree actually theon may be arrogant and full of himself but hes a much more emotional being than either of them he wants friends family to be loved cersei and viserys solely want power and will step over anyone to get it without regrets theon only wants that power because he fears being forgotten as an unloved unimpressive nobody without a home or family and thinks power can bring him that just look at how he expects everyone to treat him as lord when he takes winterfell and how bitter he gets when they dont thank him its a warped view but he wants them to like him
asoiaf,not_removed,i have a lot more sympathy for viserys actually though of course some of the shit he pulls is still inexcusable but viserys youth mustve been absolutely harrowing and terrifying by any standard by comparison theon had everything put in place to know better
asoiaf,not_removed,well i guess its how you define care about his family i really dont feel like this is a personal love thing for theon he resents asha he in some way at least subconsciously resents balon for rejecting him even if he never outright admits it he fears euron and hes none too happy about aeron and victarion either he even resents his dead brothers if i remember correctly not that you can blame him too much in a way the greyjoy family is hilarously fucked up in an increasingly dark manner he cares about his family name though that he does but thats a very different thing in asoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,theon doesnt care about his family he spends the first half of acok shitting on each and every one of them he disrespects his dead brothers in an attempt to endear himself to patrek mallister he plans to sell asha off as soon as he can he plans to displace balon he insults victarion he mocks aeron and doesnt even bother to visit alannys theon in acok is an arrogant and entitled dickhead who views everything and everyone as beneath his worth and is amusingly undermined at just about every turn theons story should be a short novella titled how to fuck yourself over in easy steps
asoiaf,not_removed,yes however its basis is the desire to belong while i criticize theon on this i see why he does it the people with which he most closely identifies and likes are his enemies he once commented that ned beat him for running over old nan and the beating was tender in comparison to the treatment he received at pyke the greyjoy family dynamic is severely twisted the fact is the starks treated him very well yet he could never be accepted by them he loves them but cannot join this puts him adrift he thinks he is doing things to impress the ironborn he is not they think he is acting foolishly and impulsively all this stems from feeling alien at home he is trying too hard he is worthy of sympathy in some ways still he had it coming
asoiaf,not_removed,robb is the heir to winterfell yet cannot accept the fact that his foster brother is actually a hostage to balon greyjoys good behaviour as race for the iron throne pointed out it probably wouldnt have mattered balon greyjoy had been calling his banners and preparing an invasion fleet hed named asha his heir meaning theon had already been written off an invasion of the north was imminent regardless of what theon or robb did theons participation and sack of winterfell ensured that the rw happened with no remaining stark boys the boltons were happy to betray robb secure in the knowledge that he had no heirs the rest of the north would rally around
asoiaf,not_removed,gets sent to winterfell wants to be loved but deep down knows hes technically a hostage gets sent to iron islands wants to be loved but turns out everyone thinks of him as the starks pet gets sent back to the north wants to be loved but his crew thinks hes just playing as an ironborn commander goes to take winterfell wants to be loved but the villagers hate him for being a traitor pseudokilling the stark boys and the ironborn hate him for keeping them from doing their normal reaving thing yeah sounds about right i think even adding to his need for love complex is growing up in neds shadow a dude that everyone loves the lannisters dont count because everyone else hates them anyways and then seeing the same thing happen for robb prebreaking his frey engagement cat releasing jamie beheading karstark theon just doesnt understand why no one ever looks at him the way people look at nedrobb loveloyalty or his own father fearrespect
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the similarity comes in how they all think that the world owes them something their actions are a reflection of that
asoiaf,not_removed,i think part of the difference is that theon grew up in peace he was best buddies with the heir of winterfell he got everything a son of nobility would want to get in his education and i for one am relatively certain that if everything hadnt gone to shit he wouldve married one of the stark girls arya if ned had more time and any sense at all and gone on to become the lord of the iron islands ushering in an era of peace between the north and the ironborn he still was a ward and head the threat of execution hanging over him though i seriously doubt that ned wouldve gone through with that considering his stance on the murder of innocents but by comparison viserys spent most of his life running for his life while being ridiculed and cersei was married to a man she resented while being offered none of the opportunities she wouldve had she been a man now neither viserys nor cersei draw sensible conclusions from their predicaments and neither are positive characters by any stretch of the imagination but i feel both of them have somewhat stronger uh excuses for becoming all fucked up than theon did
asoiaf,not_removed,its a warped view but he wants them to like him yes this is why i describe theon as a lost lonely little boy inside stolen from his home the only way he coped was by pretending that he was being fostered at winterfell and that his family really thought he was very special its an easier pill to swallow than my father is so selfish he doesnt care about me and wrote me off as dead as soon as ned stark took me to the greenlands and the starks will never accept me truly because im a hostage not a foster
asoiaf,not_removed,thats not fair though from the very first second asha and balon approach theon they ridicule him mock him and treat him like an animal its normal he resents asha and is pissed off at his father father that prepared to go to war putting at risk theon life before he came some randyll tarly level shit even worse because theon wasnt with them for the last years and grew up without ironborn culture because of balon and balon didnt even try to keep him i respect theon even more after the first acok chapters he shows he has not daddy issues like many claim but just wants to prove himself as a greyjoy and hes tired of being treated like a clown i feel theon is a very misunderstood character
asoiaf,not_removed,he doesnt resent his family until after they sort of reject him they didnt act happy to see him after being a hostage all of those years instead they treat him as an outsider and that really hurt him if his sister would have hugged him when she saw him instead of teasing him and if his dad would have welcomed him home with open arms it would have been very different but the greyjoys are a dysfunctional family and theon took it personally after that he resented them for not loving him there is a theme in the story of completely shitty fathers ruining their childrens mental health tywins poor parenting leaves cersei jaime and tyrion lacking in mental health hoster tullys poor handling of lysas emotions leads her to be kind of crazy balon with theon leaves him insecure roberts neglect causes joffrey to be absolutely insane aerys ii had a son who let his feelings start a rebellion and another one who didnt know how to love his family even ned never being able to tell jon the truth about his parentage makes jon insecure theon had brothers in the stark boys but what he really wanted was a father in the books ned treats him like a ward and doesnt really bond with him balon isnt the father he wanted in that first moment and theon loses it
asoiaf,not_removed,why should he care about his dead brothers when they used to beat him the only ironborn he had a positive attachment with is dagmer
asoiaf,not_removed,i think he cares about them but when he is fucking that captains daughter he sees himself as a future king when his father sees that he isnt the old way rape and pillage ironborn that he wants him to be he criticizes him if theon would have been able to take that criticism to heart instead of taking it personally he would have been much better to his familys cause instead theon had to watch the love that the starks just gave each other and thought that families were supposed to do that when they didnt he resented them
asoiaf,not_removed,definitely he was at least when he took winterfell jaime was when they made him a kingsguard and he was when he became kingslayer and he didnt get a pass either theon was not mentally okay but he did what he did and hes in his messed up hell of a life because of decisions he made it sucks but thats how it goes im not condoning his actions but i think his betrayal of robb was more than just i want to be a king he wanted to be a king because he wanted people to love him
asoiaf,not_removed,balon greyjoy had been calling his banners and preparing an invasion fleet hed named asha his heir meaning theon had already been written off an invasion of the north was imminent regardless of what theon or robb did the interesting thing is that balon did appear to wait until ned stark was dead and then all bets were off or is this just an illusion of how the books are presented its clear that asha has been groomed to be balons heir since theon was taken away from the dickhead islands but when did balon start preparing the iron fleet was it before or after neds death when exactly did balon decide that theons life was expendable when ned could still hypothetically take theons head or once balons enemy was dead and he assumed that the boy wolf wouldnt have the stones to do it
asoiaf,not_removed,i think all theon this is owed to him is love and respect because yes he might be an ironborn pos child murderer at this point of the story but all he was up until that point was a hostage ward who did what was expected of him and he became an exceptional bowman and horseback rider and studied next to the heir to the north under a maester of the citadel and trained under the masterofarms at one of the greatest castles in the kingdom and learned to be a lord from watching the lord of possible the greatest and oldest noble family on the continent yeah he was kind of brash and headstrong like when he shot that wildling with the arrow when he saved bran but he shot a wilding with an arrow and saved the second born son of the hand of the king he fought valiantly with robb through multiple battles during the war theons true downfall was his fathers unwarranted chip on his shoulder that didnt allow him to take a deal from robb stark that would have named him king of the iron islands because he didnt want to live in a world where his people couldnt rape and pillage theon becomes a piece of shit but when your father wants you to be a piece of shit you either forsake your family or you do what you are told
asoiaf,not_removed,knowing youre in the care of someone who could kill you on any given day and who fully accepts that they might have to ned might not like killing a child but in the context of hostage to balons good behaviour he would do itand not one single person in winterfell would stop him would fuck a child up pretty badly thats terrifying to have hanging over your head especially when youve seen your caretaker perform executions theon grew up watching ned repeatedly do the very thing that might happen to him one day he knows exactly what ned will say and do exactly what it will look like when he dies it gets worse too because theons future survival is something he has literally no control over or input in as it rests on the conduct of a father he hasnt seen in years and hes known this since he was ten viserys spent his life thinking someone was coming for him to kill him theon already knew who the someone coming for him would behis fosterfather theyre nice to me today they could kill me tomorrow
asoiaf,not_removed,father that prepared to go to war putting at risk theon life before he came people overlook this part theon arrives in the iron islands genuinely intending to be robbs envoy with these delusions hes built up over the years while a hostage in winterfell about how the return of the heir of pyke to the iron islands will be a big deal then he gets there and no one cares no one is at the docks to meet him he makes his way to the castle and finds out that his father is already plotting to raid the north as king of the iron islands now lets remind ourselves why was theon greyjoy taken as a hostage in the first place so that balon greyjoy would not crown himself with the driftwood crown and go to war with the north again for fucks sake theon has spent his life imagining that his family really care about him and that balons good behaviour is really because he doesnt want to lose his son and the first thing that he learns when he arrives in pyke is didnt care crowned myself anyway gee thanks dad now im not an expert on child psychology but i do know a bit about living with selfish arsehole fathers even when you should have expected them to do something extremely cunty it still hurts it hurts a lot example my relationship with my father was already damaged beyond repair by the time he got me to type up his memoirs when i was and i still remember the pain and anger i felt when i had to type up the words came to me and told me she was pregnant after wed been seeing each other for a while i went down to the beach and thought fuck i need this like a hole in the head i decided i had to do the right thing now bear in mind my halfsisters birth was described in these same memoirs as the most glorious day of his life i use the word extremely loosely the man was a narcissistic fuckwit who barely made it to year his memoirs were handwritten pages typed tldr theon created a fictional version of pyke where his family really cared for him and balon shattered that in under minutes theon was wounded in a way thats hard to describe to people who havent experienced that kind of betrayal by a family member
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont disagree with you on any of that really except maybe that id argue that ned was more of a father figure to theon than he is willing to admit but yeah theons story would have obviously shaken out quite differently had balon been more like his father quellon for example and had asha been not that determined to marginalize him to keep her own position as the heir of pyke and so on hes definitely edged on by all of that but i dont think that changes that theon goes along with all of it for himself rather than for his family
asoiaf,not_removed,roberts neglect causes joffrey to be absolutely insane joff is a mix of nature and nurture robert totally and utterly neglected to parent any of his children cersei overcompensated by modelling joffrey in her own narcissistic image joffrey displays a streak of sadistic violence that could be a result of cersei consistently telling him that he could do nothing wrong ever or could also be an innate mental deficiency sociopathy or psychopathy
asoiaf,not_removed,they beat him for misbehaving im sure a lot of people dont shit all over their dead parents memories because they were disciplined as a child dagmer and wex was the only one he didnt piss off instantly he spends acok being a complete dickhead to just about everyone he comes into contact with and then starts to wonder why nobody respects him
asoiaf,not_removed,i think he would go along with it for himself and his family like he might still attack winterfell but when asha tells him that he cant hold it he wont think that she is trying to usurp his status even if they didnt actually care for him balon and asha could and probably should have at least acted like they loved him the could have manipulated his emotions to get what they want and asha could have turned theon into a puppet on a chair for her instead they spurn him and cause him to rebel against both of his families which in turn leads to the downfall of both of his families
asoiaf,not_removed,i still think that if robert actually tried to raise him the way he wanted him to be he would have turned out much better mostly because he wouldnt have allowed cersei to raise him to be an absolute piece of shit myrcella and stimmen turn out alright because cersei doesnt try to raise them to be rulers robert should have been grooming his heir while letting cersei raise the other two the way she raised them you can see her trying to change tommen once he becomes king where she was originally okay with him playing with cats and being a timid naive child she quickly tries to make him stronger but he ends up committing and crying at tywins funeral if wven if joffrey was just like robert we would have a mostly goodhearted king who maybe hates targaryens and probably likes to fuck women and kill animals and people during times of war he would be very charismatic and would love the starks instead robert has nothing to do with his family and his children become lannister instead of baratheons both literally and metaphorically
asoiaf,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about theons brothers beat him because they were dicks asha liked theon as a child and child theon was quiet so he wasnt going around pissing people off its dagmer who showed him love and instilled the trait he has for smiling in him
asoiaf,not_removed,myrcella and tommen turned out ok in spite of cersei joffrey is the true measure of cerseis parenting ability and as uncle kevan notes youre as unfit a mother as you are a queen
asoiaf,not_removed,that earned him the worst thrashing he ever had at winterfell though it was almost tender compared to the beatings his brothers used to give him back on pyke the implication is that they beat him for misbehaving asha liked theon as a child and child theon was quiet so he wasnt going around pissing people off its dagmer who showed him love and instilled the trait he has for smiling in him im referring to acok

asoiaf,not_removed,ever read this theory
asoiaf,not_removed,why do you post this if its so out of the realm of possibilities you are getting people hopes up more than those theories
asoiaf,not_removed,post title ugh i came here thinking this was a viable info post sadness
asoiaf,not_removed,im pretty sure grrm replied to someones comment about internet rumors recently and he said something along the lines of dont believe anything on the internet
asoiaf,not_removed,i think theyre reading people post about it on reddit and using it as proof for the idea the idea gets posted on reddit like one a week anyways
asoiaf,not_removed,i just come to say a boygirl can dream but you slayed my joke
asoiaf,not_removed,people want to believe all sorts of silly things and there will always be trashy clickbait articles to indulge them
asoiaf,not_removed,im just curious why people think its possible like whats behind their thinking because its not logical or is it was just wondering about peoples opinions i asked grrm but he ignored me
asoiaf,not_removed,im sorry crap i feel bad i wasnt thinking when i named that duh
asoiaf,not_removed,she wasnt tywin was hoping for either a marriage with viserys or for elia to die so that he can pitch cersei to rhaegar once more
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont remember seeing anything about it i think tywin might have been waiting for better options on this one he probably wasnt going to find it with the targs and hed pretty muched shunned dorne himself hed never go for a match with the starks and im not sure he would have with the arryns unless he had to
asoiaf,not_removed,tywin was too ambitious to betroth her to anyone who wasnt on the throne or in line for it aerys was crazy and married aerys said no for rhaegar and viserys was just a kid one rebellion later and poof a new young attractive and single king became available for cersei and tywin jumped
asoiaf,not_removed,nope he kept her unmarried still hoping for a chance to marry her to rhaegar tinfoil alert ive sometimes wondered if he poisoned elia causing her ill health
asoiaf,not_removed,similar to how he never acknowledged that jaime wasnt his heir anymore he was still set on making cersei queen no matter what i remember it being suggested that he kept her at court in hopes of wedding her to rhaegar if elia died or to viserys since aerys was considering disinheriting rhaegar
asoiaf,not_removed,just curious pycelle was always loyal to the lannisters right when did he become grand maester in the court when the maesters told her she couldnt have any more children after the birth of aegon was it pycelle just following orders from tywin so that rhaegar would consider another woman of course this would backfire seeing as r went after l instead of cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,my best guess if anyone would be edmure tully he and hoster had previously has interest in jaimelysa so this would preserve that or he could always marry herto a bannerman
asoiaf,not_removed,hed never go for a match with the starks why not
asoiaf,not_removed,ive sometimes wondered if he poisoned elia causing her ill health yikes that would be rough but then again it is tywin
asoiaf,not_removed,elia was sickly from a young age both doran and oberyn mention it
asoiaf,not_removed,pycelle become grand maester shortly before summerhall
asoiaf,not_removed,he became grand maester before the tragedy at summerhall he even served egg for a bit before the tragedy struck its not certain exactly when he became a lannister ally but it was at some point before roberts rebellion id guess it was at some point during tywins time as hand of the king which was quite long
asoiaf,not_removed,just to be clear are you suggesting that pycelle maliciously tampered with elias health during her pregnancies
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre northern barbarians
asoiaf,not_removed,no im saying that pycelle could have been putting elia on bedrest for longer than what she actually needed and then saying falsely she could never have children again they said that after aegons birth in which she supposedly almost died she was bedridden for a year but we know that based on danys vision elias up and talking to her husband shortly after aegons birth and she was well enough to get on a ship and go back to kings landing id wager that most women who go through childbirth believe themselves to be near death only to be fine later besides the main function of a royal wife is to bear children anyways i mean its not like its a theory that im totally invested in and in the greater scheme of things it doesnt really matter but it was just something that popped in my head
asoiaf,not_removed,how desperate this sub has made us but i will say this robert arryn is the kind of person who would have a coke or pepsi in the morning instead of coffee
asoiaf,not_removed,ned doesnt strike me as a fan of caffeine hed be a decap man
asoiaf,not_removed,darkstar would take his coffee black of the night
asoiaf,not_removed,no matter how they took it it im sure it would end up running down their chins and soaking their beards we would also be treated to several descriptions of where it was from and precisely how it was brewed
asoiaf,not_removed,shagga in a cup
asoiaf,not_removed,pycelle no coffee just creamer and sugar
asoiaf,not_removed,robert baratheon likes his coffee the same way he likes his women wet
asoiaf,not_removed,euron dead eye coffee quentyn roasted coffee the montain strong coffee bran coffee strong enough to stand up by itself
asoiaf,not_removed,the wildlings would add alcohol their coffee
asoiaf,not_removed,with booze is probably a safe assumption for a lot of characters definitely robert tyrion and cersei for obvious reasons but id also imagine the watch adopting the idea of liquor with or without coffee as a good treatment for cold needless to say youd need both coffee and hard liquor to exist in westeros something i remembered as i was writing that i always seem to forget is that unlike chocolate coffee is not from the new world and so theres really no reason it couldnt exist in the verse and so assuming things kind of followed history coffee would probably come from the summer islands and go from there to the free citiesdorne with coffee houses springing up and other areas that had comparable climate also starting to cultivate coffee needless to say depending on the area this would involve slave labor because of the culture oldtown would probably be one of the first places to have them in the main part of westeros because the watch is oddly close to braavos it would oddly make sense for them to be an early adopter of coffee as opposed to say like the riverlands
asoiaf,not_removed,the dornish drink turkish coffee cersei drinks irish coffee euron drinks shadeoftheevening coffee stannis drinks only cold water
asoiaf,not_removed,karl the fookin legend tanner would take it out of the skull of jeor mormont
asoiaf,not_removed,gyles rosby drinks coughy drogon roasts his own beans stannis grinds his own with his teeth shae and ros drink moon tea instead cersei only drinks kahlua the kindly man takes his black and flat white aeron brews his with saltwater damnit now i have to go out and get cup myself
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion with a big belt of whiskey in it
asoiaf,not_removed,i think id be amazed westeros invented french press before the printing press
asoiaf,not_removed,jon arryn with poison too soon
asoiaf,not_removed,euron black as night and sweet as sin
asoiaf,not_removed,jon takes his with cinnaemon
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis black sugar
asoiaf,not_removed,the others make theirs iced
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime with his left hand viserys would not drink it only pour it over his head while its still hot
asoiaf,not_removed,even more asinine than why dont they wear hats thread in gameofthrones and i didnt think it could be done
asoiaf,not_removed,ramsey with coffeemate spenda and a chained barista watching in horror
asoiaf,not_removed,this is the best rasoiaf thread in a long time
asoiaf,not_removed,there was coffee in the middle agesrenaissance but it was more of a middle eastern thing id expect coffee to be a thing in either the eastern or southern continents master illyrio would probably drink it tyrion would become a huge coffee drinker while hes trying to detox and get super addicted to caffeine
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the nights watch would only have those nespresso instant coffee flakes edd would complain about it endlessly i suppose its better than dying or sanka
asoiaf,not_removed,ketlleblack
asoiaf,not_removed,the show thenns would have it alongside a hot pie
asoiaf,not_removed,gregor clegane would take his with milk of the poppy
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis black and filtered through his own clenched teeth
asoiaf,not_removed,ramsay ground up and stored in the back of the larder cersei drunk before lunch petyr baelish a bit nutty jaime thrown onto an unsuspecting passerby four stories below samwell not too hot but with a nice mug
asoiaf,not_removed,egg likes dunks
asoiaf,not_removed,okay so i sent this question to my barrista asoiaf reader gf and here are her answers majority of people depresso mel double americano cause the night is dark and full of terrors jon snow probably filter sansa decaf vanilla frapuccino with lemon sprinkkles white walkers probably flat white daenerys capuccion cause shes boring arya super strong ristretto
asoiaf,not_removed,sandor would drink tea because coffee is for cunts
asoiaf,not_removed,jon and benjen would take the blackit i mean it black
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion and cersei would remain with wine
asoiaf,not_removed,ramsay likes his coffee like he likes his women ground up and in the freezer
asoiaf,not_removed,everyone in the north black exception manderlymilk with as much sugar as he could get his hands on
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei like a myrish swamp robert strong just eat the roasted beans like beer nuts
asoiaf,not_removed,varys would take small sips of coffee while describing how he was cut
asoiaf,not_removed,holy fuck just popped on to this sub for the first time in a while we need a new book
asoiaf,not_removed,lol
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis would just drink his black
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis would have plain black coffee melisandre would want hers with ghost peppers in her cup
asoiaf,not_removed,he strikes me more as a morning yoohoo drinker
asoiaf,not_removed,you think robert hairtrigger seizures arryn is allowes near caffeine
asoiaf,not_removed,did you just
asoiaf,not_removed,and he likes his beer headless
asoiaf,not_removed,this comment made this ridiculous post worth it
asoiaf,not_removed,i like my coffee like my soul black crawling in my skinnnnnnnnnnn
asoiaf,not_removed,black as midnight on a moonless night
asoiaf,not_removed,darkstar would take his cofee the same as his soul light and creamy
asoiaf,not_removed,theyd end up chewing their lip after
asoiaf,not_removed,creamer is an american thing
asoiaf,not_removed,milk with a little creamer in it a flavored one like some vanilla thing or whatever is delicious
asoiaf,not_removed,with blackberry jam
asoiaf,not_removed,the hound fuck the coffee
asoiaf,not_removed,jon black coffee ned decafp coffee arya black white coffee
asoiaf,not_removed,the wildlings would add alcohol to their alcohol ftfy
asoiaf,not_removed,where would the wildlings get hold of alcohol
asoiaf,not_removed,they should have hard liquor easily in our world distilled alcohol turns up in europe by the twelfth century its even earlier in the islamic world
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis drinks only cold water please stannis doesnt drink coffee he just takes a handful of beans and eats them raw takes fewer time
asoiaf,not_removed,cold lemon water to be exact
asoiaf,not_removed,george needs to drink more of it the nights watch takes the black melisandre prefers her roast dark and full of terrors vargo hoat likes it with thteamed milk and a thrpinkle of thinnamon gillys babe takes it with steamed mothers milk ygritte rolls her eyes when she asks jon if he wants to go out for coffee and he starts looking for his starbucks card loras takes it no never mind ramsay prefers a cáscara latte ser robert likes it strong dunk likes it thick as a castle wall belwas likes his strong with liver and onions theon has to drink his with a straw balon pays the iron price and never leaves a tip sams too afraid hell burn his tongue wyman manderlys coffee is prepared from freyroasted beans rosie and pate take it fearsomely strong tommen wont touch it having heard its brewed from coffee beats areo avoids it fearing it will spill on his camera ser ilyn cant say gerris only drinks water renly always orders two peach frappuccinos one for stannis marillion brews it with four packets of saccharine symon silvertongues coffee somehow wound up in the brown melisandre mistook the barista for azor ahai davos only wants a little maybe about four fingers brienne is looking for a barista of three and ten with auburn hair salladhor saan is thinking that he is liking his in a golden chalice and sooner rather than later he is thinking last words of aerion brightflame wtf kind of coffee was that well that was fun is winds of winter out yet
asoiaf,not_removed,analysing is a strong word for whats happening here
asoiaf,not_removed,viserys would not drink it only pour it over his head while its still hot how else are you supposed to wake the dragon
asoiaf,not_removed,hmm what was the conclusion of that topic
asoiaf,not_removed,thats what happens when youve already discussed literally everything there is to discuss
asoiaf,not_removed,i actually wonder a lot why they dont wear hats in the north have a link or summary of that discussion
asoiaf,not_removed,were completely fucking out of reasonable things to discuss
asoiaf,not_removed,samwell not too hot but with a nice mug and a fat pink biscotti
asoiaf,not_removed,edward
asoiaf,not_removed,his mamas booby milk
asoiaf,not_removed,yoohoo oho
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean his seizures are probably the result of some lf poison so why not
asoiaf,not_removed,i cant even
asoiaf,not_removed,then hed have just milk ans sugar
asoiaf,not_removed,thx
asoiaf,not_removed,theyve got uber stronge spirits
asoiaf,not_removed,its not exactly difficult to make booze
asoiaf,not_removed,thats a good point i remember posting a comment somewhere about how to some extent it was anachronistic in the tv show to have karl tanner being from gin alley and lady crane drinking rum since neither beverage is mentioned in the books however as you say its not that unbelievable that they could exist in the setting theres also ollies potatoes in the show which are a problem but so are the books mention of corn maize and turkeys
asoiaf,not_removed,grinds them in his teeth
asoiaf,not_removed,takes fewer time i see what you did there
asoiaf,not_removed,fewer
asoiaf,not_removed,ok now a bunch of chuck norrisstyle jokes about stannis just started happening in my mind
asoiaf,not_removed,the freys do and small folk and that one dude on neds execution stand
asoiaf,not_removed,waitthats a damn good question
asoiaf,not_removed,you know rob and johns father
asoiaf,not_removed,in his coffee
asoiaf,not_removed,his seizures are result of him having some sort of genetic disorder in fact many of them cause seizures lf just consciously lets maester treat him with too high doses of a drug with cumulative harmful effect
asoiaf,not_removed,milk of the poppy
asoiaf,not_removed,thats better seriously though whats wrong with milk in coffee its not exactly calorie dense
asoiaf,not_removed,i am not sure that the wildlings have abundance of crops fruits or berries to waste them on fermenting i guess they could raid for some alcohol or ingredients when they go south im sure the wildlings have some booze but itd be a relatively rare commodity compared to south of the wall wouldnt waste it on coffee if i were them
asoiaf,not_removed,as soon as youve got someone a glass blower who can make an alembic you can make a still rum is mentioned in the books it would be an import to westeros and thus likely expensive but the summer islanders drink it
asoiaf,not_removed,pour hot water in his mouth and grind the beans in his mouth
asoiaf,not_removed,tycho nestoris hat sounded pretty fancy perhaps thats the fashion in bravvos though and westorosi just cant keep up
asoiaf,not_removed,or theyre because the souls of the cotf in his weirwood throne are trying to warg into him
asoiaf,not_removed,it depends on how sweet you like your coffee personally i have used both creamer and milk in coffee throughout my life and i found i had to put more sugar in my coffee to have the same taste as my normal creamer
asoiaf,not_removed,theyve got sour goats milk much better than that grape water those southern twats drink
asoiaf,not_removed,they can ferment milk they can ferment honey tormund has something about mead in his many titles or tree sap that they tap maple or birch would do you can boozify an awful lot of things
asoiaf,not_removed,and in the show i think it was season beric offered arya some rum from a flask
asoiaf,not_removed,cant get any fresher than that
asoiaf,not_removed,i am removing this per our prohibition against silly content and memes
asoiaf,not_removed,probably one of the best warriors in the series sadly being a distant cousin from minor nobility has meant he has been overshadowed by more famous warriors from better families
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think the golden company will need to kill every baratheon bastard some of them will die like the girl at stoney sept who will be a casualty of faithbowl but i expect others to be used by aegon to support his rule edric storm is in lys and may have been captured by illyrios agents he could help rally the stormlords and rule storms end once connington dies for instance if mya has any larger role in the politics of the realm i think its more likely to be in proving that tommen is illegitimate as for flowers i think hes more likely to advance into the reach under rowan and tarly to capture highgarden and its granaries hell likely die in battle against the nightfallwielding garlan tyrell who is married to a fossoway acting as fodder to show how badass garlan is just like the knight of harlaw
asoiaf,not_removed,if i recall correctly lothur distinguished himself defeating some knights at joffreys name day tourney he was also set to match up against ser dontos and he witnessed sansa plead for dontos life just adding my two cents that lothur is also a spyinformant
asoiaf,not_removed,i loved your writeup on lothor until this point y has to eliminate any remaining claim to baratheon legitimacy including each and every one of roberts bastards edric storm ser gendry of the hollow hill that girl at stoney sept and mya stone the mule girl the bastards of robert have no claim on the legitimacy of house baratheons claim to the throne especially since more than a few dont even know their heritage gendry and bella dont i dont remember if mya is aware i dont know if joncon is ruthless enough to hunt down a bunch of bastards just for being bastards of the man who killed his mancrush hes not joffrey or cersei after all who could be mean and cruel for the sake of it and since the golden company is currently fighting a war without local allies or dragons he probably doesnt have the resources to hunt down any bastards that arent even contributing to the war especially the ones he isnt aware of and if joncon isnt aware of it why would someone like franklyn be aware of it given all the mudds lothstons strongs and rivers in the company they may just be headed for the riverlands first off the lothstons are an old house that technically expired during the reign of maekar and replaced by the whents as the owners of harrenhal any gc lothston is either a fake or a fourth generation exile the gc are more democratic than most armies but theyre not going to vote to invade the weakass and indefensible riverlands especially when theres a lannister army marching from there to kl not when they havent even conquered their landing point the voting seems to be for decisions about the fate of the gc mostly which sides to fight for also if and why they should break their bond with an employer which seems to have happened only once and probably on their leaders the mercenary companies are among the only meritocracies in the world i believe daario and greyworm were both elected by their men voting definitely wont happen on the strategictactical level applebowl if thats the standard for bowl then any fight with a clegane in it could be cleganebowl any fight with a bastard in it could be bastardbowl
asoiaf,not_removed,great write up ironically brune brun means brown in french
asoiaf,not_removed,this is brilliant the best tinfoil comes studded with truth and uhollowaydivision is a legendary master foilsmith
asoiaf,not_removed,when you kidnap a fossoway its called applejacking
asoiaf,not_removed,jesus this is my favourite theory ive heard in like a year applebowl please
asoiaf,not_removed,just want to point out that lothr brune was mentioned in season two episode one he was supposed to fight ser dontos
asoiaf,not_removed,the logic is lothor brune has killed some fossoways before so hes destined for a showdown with the only fossoway bastard introduced in the story big leap especially because myas gonna be in the vale and i dont see the golden company heading that way any time soon
asoiaf,not_removed,if i could choose for whom i squired it would probably be lothor
asoiaf,not_removed,applebowl sounds like a legitimately coolplausible idea however i think theres more potentially interesting foreshadowing based upon the passages youve cited ser lothar brune kills littlefinger defending sansa yes hes under the employ of littlefinger and likely a spyinformantbut what if hes a doubleagent we do not know enough to say he isnt working for someone besides littlefinger and for being such a decent dudeit seems strange hes working for littlefinger or someone like him such as cersie etc he didnt claim his lands and keep so why would he be persuaded by gold to work for people like littlefinger suppose he works for lf because someone more honorable asked him to promise to do something more important and in secret ned he was into those types of agreements at the tourney of the hand ned surely met with many of the knights in attendance andor participating surely he made a point to speak to the men with notably honorable reputationshistories to assess them for himself and to request that they protectassist him and his family while in kings landing ned wasnt as naivestupid as he seemed almost certainly and i would like to imagine that he made some effort to request the service of true knights to the realm to work as counteroperativessleeper agents for himself so lothar has been working for ned all along protecting sansa under the guise of working for lf i could spin more foil provide citations etc ill make a postthis sounds like a super fun essayresearchbut too late right now
asoiaf,not_removed,this is why i think its so interesting that he seems destined for a showdown with franklyn flowers the brown apple fossoway both have been screwed over in some way by a classist system i cant find the quote but the actual house brune told lothar to fuck off when he approached them just like house fossoway did when franklyn was born
asoiaf,not_removed,like ser richard horpe described as being one of the best swordsmen in the realm and hoped to be part of the kingsguard but was instead passed over for being scarred and from a house of lesser repute
asoiaf,not_removed,probably one of the best warriors in the series sadly being a distant cousin from minor nobility has meant he has been overshadowed by more famous warriors from better families is he where is this mentioned i dont ever remember this being discussed or even slightly hinted at
asoiaf,not_removed,god i hope garlan fucks up the ironborn im so worried for him
asoiaf,not_removed,well i think the declaration of connningtons intention to end the usurpers line for good means the inclusion of bastards since the magic baratheon gene is recognizable by everyone who has ever seen one brienne recognized gendry immediately why else have them dotted around the map if not to bring them into the baratheontargaryen legitimacy plot and speaking of gendry theres more foreshadowing of hostility between connington and the bastards since you mention the faith aegon aligning with the faith will necessarily make him an opponent of ser gendry who is so angered by meribald saying grace before dinner that he storms outside septon meribald looked across the table and said do you have no love for the gods son not for your gods gendry stood abruptly i have work to do he stalked out without a bite of food is there some other god he loves asked hyle hunt the lord of light piped one scrawny boy nigh to six plus there is another goddamn important baratheon out there who worships the lord of light and dont you count him out yet if i was battlehardened knight who worshipped the lord of light and found out i was a baratheon bastard i and that aegon and the seven were putting my brothers and sisters to death i know exactly who id be swearing my sword to
asoiaf,not_removed,there is no doubt that littlefinger is brunes employer on par with oswell kettleblack oswell has been in my service a long time and brune is closemouthed by nature
asoiaf,not_removed,lothur distinguished himself defeating some knights at joffreys name day tourney i believe sandor compared competition in that tourney to swatting gnats
asoiaf,not_removed,thats a good point and if he does recognize sansa despite the hair dye that leaves us with two pretty reasonable possibilities hes a spyinformant and he hasnt revealed her identity or let harm come to her ex marillion because hes waiting for the appropriate time having seen her go out of her way to secure mercy for dontos he respects her and considers it his knightly duty to protect her he hasnt revealed her identity because doing so would put her in danger and he protected her from marillion because it was the right thing to do itll be interesting to see how the vale plays out
asoiaf,not_removed,its applebowl because ff is a fossoway and lothar is renowned for killing fossoways they also both have nicknames involving apples brown apple and apple eater therefore applebowl symbolism bastards are dangerous because roberts bastards are pretty much unmistakable in every instance and enemy kings can legitimize bastards to use them as political tools like stannis almost did with jon ending the usurpers line means killing stannis as well and any baratheon bastard could be made stannis heir
asoiaf,not_removed,oh holy fuck grrm you take my breath away
asoiaf,not_removed,no one could doubt the value of a foiler and so we name one of the seven in his honor but we might as easily have called him the farmer or the fisherman the carpenter or the cobbler what he foils at makes no matter what matters is he foils thanks a bunch dude i learned all i know in qohor
asoiaf,not_removed,and if you get laid afterwards flapjacking
asoiaf,not_removed,dont tell anyone but this is part one of seven on seven separate vendettas between knights that will eventually result in a trial by seven
asoiaf,not_removed,i see littlefingers entourage in the vale along with the winged knights moving to harrenhal once the war dies down so lothar and littlefinger can claim their lands the gc also has designs on the riverlands with or more possible members of old riverlander houses in their ranks its free fertile land and come peacetime everyone will want it besides now that the eyrie is uninhabitable for the winter myas out of a mule job winter has come mychel redforts a dick and she has no reason to stay in the vale
asoiaf,not_removed,though he had risen to knighthood ser lothors birth had been very low one night he had told her that he was kin to the brunes of brownhollow an old knightly family from crackclaw point i went to them when my father died he confessed but they shat on me and said i was no blood of theirs he would not speak of what happened after that except to say that he had learned all he knew of arms the hard way
asoiaf,not_removed,both have been screwed over in some way by a classist system thats one of the reasons i think lothor may be one of the most loyal baelish men or at least hope so hes a badass whose low birth held him back but baelish promotes on merit and those who gain something significant from that seems to be the more loyal ones
asoiaf,not_removed,i once thought garlan along with thousands of others would drown while assaulting the shields with euron using captured redwyne galleys as a trojan horse and using the blood sacrifice to perform some unholy magic but from what ive seen in the forsaken chapter it looks like garlan will be safe for the moment you dont give a sword named nightfall i mean how badass is that to a random and let it stay there garlan will take the sword from how he treated tyrion and sansa i think he and sam will get along well at highgarden my only worry is the coming struggle between randyll tarly and house tyrell
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry joining up with stannis to fight aegon would be my dream
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry being a knighta thing of the seven and a follower of the lord of light is a sort of oxymoron i guess that knighting everyone in the brotherhood is a joke
asoiaf,not_removed,or he protected sansa because littlefinger told him to and hes known its sansa the entire time he was on the boat that picked her up from kings landing
asoiaf,not_removed,bastards are dangerous because roberts bastards are pretty much unmistakable in every instance well that is not true gendry grew up in the largest city of the realm and only people with inside information knew who he was brienne was a little obsessed with renly running into a doppelgänger is going to stand out for her to the majority of others he is just another peasant
asoiaf,not_removed,obsessed
asoiaf,not_removed,thats the one in brune culture this is considered a dick move
asoiaf,not_removed,littlefinger is like a really strange combination of humbert humbert from lolita and vladimir lenin one just accepts him as a force of nature after a while in the fandom but he truly is an original character
asoiaf,not_removed,he just seems like a good guy and a badass so he will probably die some horrible death
asoiaf,not_removed,eurons making magic chum for a grand creature
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its happening under aegons rule assuming it happens the brotherhood seems about to split into two factions a seventargaryen loyalist faction that follows aegon and a red godsmallfolk faction led by jaime thoros and brienne that emulates the kingswood brotherhood jaime fought in his youth so as weve seen gendry cares about two things the red god because of his experience with thoros gendry was watching the red priest as well can you truly see the future there he asked suddenly thoros turned from the fire sighing not here not now but some days yes the lord of light grants me visions justice for westeros especially the smallfolk because of growing up in flea bottom being in the bwb and seeing the carnage of war at the hollow hill what you said about being king roberts men and brothers i liked that i liked that you gave the hound a trial lord bolton just hanged folk or took off their heads and lord tywin and ser amory were the same id sooner smith for you as weve seen stannis cares about two things the red god because of his experience with melisandre she has shown it to me lord davos in the flames you saw it sire it was not like stannis baratheon to lie about such a thing with mine own eyes justice for westeros because of his onion knight and because hes motherfucking stannis i shall bring justice to westeros and when i come into my kingdom he shall every man shall reap what he has sown from the highest lord to the lowest gutter rat and some will lose more than the tips off their fingers i promise you they have made my kingdom bleed and i do not forget that so theres that parallel and stannis mention of the lowest gutter rat reaping what he has sown foreshadows gendry our resident lowest gutter rat being rewarded in the same manner stannis reward davovs gendry has fought nobly for roberts realm and stannis wouldnt overlook that on top of that gendry clearly blames westerosi feudalism on some level behind them gendry groaned lords and ladies he proclaimed in a disgusted tone and by twow stannis is more than agreeing with him would that all the lords in the seven kingdoms had but a single neck stannis promise to punish those who have made his kingdom bleed is needed nowhere more than the riverlands who have been shit on and shit on and shit on since the series began to the point where they have to literally live underground out of fear of being slaughtered in war weve seen what the golden company do to the lands they reclaim chain nodded some girls was persuaded might be the same way our smallfolk were persuaded to give you all their crops melons or maidenheads its all the same to your sort if you want it you take it lady mertyns turned to arianne if you should see this lord connington you tell him that i knew his mother and she would be ashamed the riverlands dont need aegon and his posse foraging any more of their land and smallfolk they need justice they need a king who cares and if not aegon they need someone with the iron bank hookup to pay back all those brotherhood promissory notes in other words they need need stannis baratheon and as for gendry if a certain someone happens to fuck up majorly and burn a certain little girl while stannis is off conquering winterfell stannis is going to need a new heir its you who are forgetting king stannis replied melisandre put a warm hand on jons arm a king can remove the taint of bastardy with a stroke
asoiaf,not_removed,thats what clegane says but he thinks knighthood itself is a joke that whole quote about knighthood being a silk ribbon tied around a horse ive always thought the so many vows speech dunks attacking aerion the attitude of the brotherhood toward the smallfolk the acok riverlands ser gergor it all points to grrms opinion of knighthood maybe what you could call the moral is that the most important part of the vows the one that should take precedence is protecting the weak and the innocent a hedge knight is the truest kind of knight dunk the old man had told him a long long time ago other knights serve the lords who keep them or from whom they hold their lands but we serve where we will for men whose causes we believe in every knight swears to protect the weak and innocent but we keep the vow best i think queer how strong that memory seemed on another note that is why jaime is central to the riverlands plot if its about knighthood in his kingslaying jaime basically went through the whole list of vows in the paragraph above in his head and at the critical moment picked that part of the vow to protect and defend the innocent over everything else but ned stark and barristan and everyone else didnt understand this so he had to endure years of people telling him he had no honor when he made the most honorable choice of all and me that boy i was when did he die i wonder when i donned the white cloak when i opened aeryss throat that boy had wanted to be ser arthur dayne but someplace along the way he had become the smiling knight instead so if at the beginning of agot hes turned into a cynic and is in smiling knight mode his dark night of the soul no longer valuing innocents ie pushing bran out the window but since meeting brienne its been his journey to redemption as thoros says to brienne right before the bwb demands jaime lannister you are not the only one with wounds lady brienne some of my brothers were good men when this began some were less good shall we say though there are those who say it does not matter how a man begins but only how he ends they all have their own reasons to be cynical but deep down jaime brienne dunk and sandor all believe that the truest knight defends the innocent above all else thats why i think jaime will lead the antiaegon faction of the bwb
asoiaf,not_removed,jorah is a knight too
asoiaf,not_removed,yep and it looks like it will happen in the redwyne straits instead of the shield islands and his seacorpseholy blooddragon will then attack oldtown
asoiaf,not_removed,its you who are forgetting king stannis replied melisandre put a warm hand on jons arm a king can remove the taint of bastardy with a stroke wouldnt it be ironic that stannis would legitimize gendry he seems to hate bastards or maybe just edric storm and i would absolutely love a gendry and stannis team up maybe hell look at him as the son he always wanted gendry seems to be a perfect mix of all the baratheon brothers
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry talked to thoros once curious about the red god and thoros powers and now all of a sudden gendry only cares about two things and the red god is one of them huge leap and a clear case of cherrypicking to make a point among things gendry cares about more than the red god and less than justice for westeros both of these things are obviously things you cherrypicked for gendry to line him up with stannis are arya smithing more things
asoiaf,not_removed,at crossbow inn gendry storms out of the room because septon meribald says grace and brienne is specifically told that he loves the lord of light gendry is very impressed with the flaming sword able to tell arya that it was magic not wildfire since he saw all of berics other fake flaming swords he believes very much in the red god
asoiaf,not_removed,some little kid at the inn said that probably because the brotherhood itself has connections to the lord of light not because gendry is particularly devout again definitely way too little evidence for the claim that gendry thinks it and justice are the most important things to him thats transparently you trying to link him to stannis based on very little
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry stormed out of the room broadcasting hatred even meribald noticed do you have no love for the seven boy and the kid knows gendry hes the one who stays at the inn with willow and his forge to keep orphans safe and the class dynamic is the entire underpinning of gendrys relationship with arya lords and ladies he proclaimed in a disgusted tone and his later statement that he liked that gave the hound a trial vs everyone else hes encountered does point to an affinity for justice which the riverlands are particularly devoid of
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry stormed out of the room broadcasting hatred even meribald noticed obviously meribald noticed thats who gendry was talking to my reading of the scene is that gendry is upset about religion generally i dont think he is a real follower of the red god the same way that most of the brotherhood is not and again think it is reaching to say it is something he cares a lot about and sure he has an affinity for justice like arya and littlefinger and ned and davos and dany and every good person weve met in the story
asoiaf,not_removed,i think in a weird way he wanted to be ned stark he saw himself more as ned than as his own father he didnt want to terrorize the north he wanted what ned had respect admiration and love from the people in the north he wanted to imitate ned and ned ruled from winterfell all that mixed with his frustrating childhood as a hostage where he was below everybody that probably gave him fantasies about rulling winterfell in that hes not that dissimilar to jon whos upbringing as a bastard brought him frustration and a repressed desire of becoming lord of winterfell the manner in which they both handled it was very different of course
asoiaf,not_removed,he wanted glory taking and holding winterfell was the glory option returning with hostages was the sensible option
asoiaf,not_removed,indeed the strategically smart way would be sack winterfell capture the heirs and deliver them back to pyke itd be a massive blow for the starks and north in general and theon would gain balons and his countrymen respect for paying the iron price for the two princes however that could only work if theon was a monster he may just about be able to do that to a city and people he never visited but winterfell is essentially his home full of the only friends and family he truly had he took winterfell greyjoy style but tried to rule it like a stark and it backfired as nobody took him seriously tldr theon tried to be halfgreyjoy and halfstark at the same time and failed at both
asoiaf,not_removed,he didnt go back because using bran rickon as hostagesgifts to his father would probably end up in both of them being dead he didnt intend on spilling any blood when he first got there much less stark blood eventually things got out of control on him as he balanced trying to maintain powerrespect without being completely ruthlessbrutal to the inhabitants of winterfell
asoiaf,not_removed,theon wanted to be seen as a true iron born by his biological father balon and in doing so he betrayed the memoryideals of his adopted family and true dad ned stark something he eventually realizes and regrets an iron born would not think to kidnap the stark boys and run back to pyke they paid the iron price and to them it all now belonged to them theon is a very fascinating character and has one of the best character arcs in the series and a great commentary on identity choice and regretredemption that being said the larger issue to me is what was balon thinking a seafaring people claiming the largest and harshest kingdom within the realm even if they managed to hold their claimed territories and holdfasts winter would irrevocably wreak them if they truly wanted to return the old ways they should have attacked the westerlands easier environment and similarly exposed due to the war of the kings ie almost all upside he attacked the north due to his ill will towards robert baratheon and his friend ned stark and used the old ways as a smokescreen for his intent
asoiaf,not_removed,theon wanted to be powerful taking bran and rickon wouldnt have got him any more power or even respect holding the largest castle in the north would have if he hadnt done it so badly
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly this hes even constantly baffled by the fact that people dont want him there and thinks hes being just he has major identity issues because hes been told he doesnt fit in anywhere hes not a true northener nor a true ironborn hes nothing the only place he kinda used to fit in was by robbs side but of course he was secretely jealous of him as was jon and had to screw it up
asoiaf,not_removed,he saw himself more as ned than as his own father he didnt want to terrorize the north he wanted what ned had respect admiration and love from the people in the north he wanted to imitate ned and ned ruled from winterfell the show captures this arc of theons so well he is desperate for praise in winterfell and in pyke he tries to make up for it with a cocksure attitude throughout season but deep down hes just a lost little boy who was stolen from his family and raised as a hostage that scene between theon and luwin where theon finally articulates what has been eating at him for all these years the leash that ned stark had to keep him on for robert baratheon it chafed god that is some of alfie allens best work such good acting and of course the circle turns fully when he admits while in the bolton dungeons that my father died in kings landing whats interesting is that when theon pledges his allegiance to robb in dakingindanorf scene what does he say am i your brother now and always now and always you have my sword the king in the north i was rewatching this recently when mum stayed for xmas and i got her to binge on got while i wrote tried to look like i was writing my many postgrad assignments its really curious knowing what we know later about theons fall that this is his precondition to robb for pledging his sword to him am i part of your family do you consider me a brother do you trust me as an equal poor theon was so desperate for a home for a family that he went to extreme and abhorrent lengths to prove himself to his birth family only to find that they still considered him tainted by the greenland values of ned stark
asoiaf,not_removed,he let reek ramsay go because at that point it didnt look like things could possibly get any worse than they already were theon didnt have the men to hold winterfell against the north and so far as the world knew hed killed his two hostages his error was in staying at all letting ramsay go was something he couldnt have known would mean anything worse than what he could expect once rodrick retook winterfell
asoiaf,not_removed,this is actually something which the show does far better than the book you are right his intentions and drive are much more clear and logical
asoiaf,not_removed,show theon is so tragic alfie allen plays him so well theon deserves all the awards edit i just consolidated into one blog post
asoiaf,not_removed,sansa has frequently been labeled little bird littlefingermockingbird little bird could this title be foreshadowing linking her to a future tied entirely to littlefinger could we be in for a full heel turn by sansa and her taking up arms against jon before its all said and done
asoiaf,not_removed,theres nothing to stop recruits from leaving before they take their vows but think about it if youre a recruit that means you either signed up voluntarily in which case you probably wouldnt leave or youre there because youre a criminal in which case its open season on you if you escape the north is definitely huge and easy to get lost in but thats doesnt strike me as particularly appealing to a deserter so youve deserted now what live in the forest forever go to a village where your accent and lack of knowledge about the north will mark you as an outsider in a place thats probably used to keeping an eye out for strangers who are likely deserters trek hundreds if not thousands of miles back to your home where people will probably be like hey werent you a condemned criminal bound for the nights watch seems like the nights watch is a better choice than any of that bullshit especially if you end up as a builder or steward and dont have to do any fighting its pretty much whatever your old life as a peasant was except now youre guaranteed food and shelter
asoiaf,not_removed,lets say you are a nw wannabe deserter manage to take foodtoolshorseblanket you need the horse because theres only so much miles you can travel a day from the place youve run away from no horse your brethren will get you know the geography you must travel south without coming close to any urban contact you are all dressed in black everyone and their mother know who you are and what youre doing here bullshitting them into thinking you are a recruiter good luck with that you lack a horse and a cart and for those you need to stay on the kingsroad and hope no one ever questions your lack of documents bandits wolves sickness lack of food whatever trouble may arise youre alone the day you manage to rob someone of their clothes its not the day you can walk around freely its a medievallike rural setting where everyone knows everyone and youre the oddest new thing since possibly years and youre travelling from north to south and means this guy is running away from the nw even in the unlikely case you havent already an ugly suspicious face there are only three ways you can objectively desert one pull a brynder rivers and become a tree chances are life wont be that good assuming you have the proper genetics two pull a chett you need very specific conditions for that youre not a ranger or a mance disappear while ranging and live as a nights watch exmember the rest of your life hoping no one kills you both options require you to spend the rest of your life beyond the wall hooray for a good life three be a highly specific nw member witha distinctive skillset hope for a mission away from westeros and once youre out run away and hope for the best thats called the dareon special and on paper looks like the one with more probabilities in its favor keep in mind you must be able to sustain yourself once you desert
asoiaf,not_removed,hmmm a few points there are no dedicated guards to keep everybody at the castle dudes go to molestown all the time and jon just rode south from the castle in the night early on in the story however jon was tracked down by his friends that night keep in mind this is a place chock full of rangers who can probably track something or someone pretty well if they need to they are probably on pretty good terms with the farthest northern houses who dont want the deserters around killing and raping their people so they can just send word out that there was a deserter and the north would be on the lookout at various points it was commented on how several of the brothers have extremely dark pasts but they also say everyones past gets put aside at the wall however given that many of the criminals were sent there as an alternative to execution im guessing if someone like biter took a chunk out of a sworn brothers face hed not last long before becoming about a foot shorter tldr i think its mainly just a self policing unit with everyone knowing that the alternative is execution
asoiaf,not_removed,where do you go north of the wall and take your chances with the wights and the windlings or south and hope no one sees you for what you are a deserter like the one we meet at the very beginning of the first book
asoiaf,not_removed,if they are men of the nights watch and they leave pretty much anyone who finds them will execute them regardless if they are recruits they are still free to leave as they swore no vows
asoiaf,not_removed,westeros is a very unforgiving place unless you somehow made it east to the free cities you arent going to live long on your own as a recruit who deserted the nights watch the first thing they do is dress you in all black and probably take all of your other clothingpossessions they would have nothing and nowhere to go if someone with intentions of deserting had a better alternative in life they would probably have taken that instead of going to the wall remember that arya immediately recognizes dareon in braavos and feels compelled to punish him for deserting when he throws his cloak in sams face even sam gets so riled up as to punch him anyone in westeros that sees someone who looks like a nw deserter will either kill them or turn them into a lord for justice
asoiaf,not_removed,when jon deserts and comes back hes told that its fairly common for new watchmen to run away they know when people are likely to leave they go and bring them back they dont always execute them on the spot for desertion the ones that get pretty far south get executed when they are caught its not like theres a sears along the way where they can steal some new clothing
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah they have spies when jon goes south mormont said that he knew about it and was going to get him in the morning if he didnt come back himself
asoiaf,not_removed,karl the fooking legend from gin alley would probably fall into the same category as rorge he disliked being in the nights watch but its better than being executedimprisoned at least until he found an opportunity to break free as to whats to stop desertion nothing sure you run the risk of being found but as we saw in affc the singer of the nights watch had no problem leaving once they got to bravos
asoiaf,not_removed,they can try to disappear or go beyond the wall and live in some old ruin like crasters keep and im sure that some manage to make it out of the gift and through the north without dying to nature find some non watch clothes they are pretty distinct for a reason and out to somewhere where they wont be recognized but think of it this way the last major and even close to successful wildling uprising was a good deal of time before the events of the books they get decent for a convict food shelter and luxuries they get to avoid whatever people want to take the law into their own hands or want them to suffer pretty good when running means risking getting beheaded indentured or enslaved the latter is unlikely but it jorah still managed to pull it off robbed by bandits soldiers and rebels eaten by animals tortured or played with by some boltonesque house that finds you on their lands sent back to your horrible wife put in the various fucking terrifying dungeons that apparently dot westeros or whatever else also they have guards posted around the castle and it isnt like everyone sleeps at the same time it would be too dangerous if they dont have at least someone guarding their stores forge and stables at night id be baffled so when a person decides to sneak out they have to contend with a gauntlet of suspicious brothers who dont just hand out horses and food for the road then make it out of the open space of the gift so that several people cant just spread out across each major road out of the castle and run you down tldr the watch looks way more attractive than a sky cell the black cells the boltons cloak room or illyn payne
asoiaf,not_removed,id guess that most people really intent on escaping would have tried their luck before they got to the wall and if they did that several times they may just be executed early
asoiaf,not_removed,good breakdown thats called the dareon special and on paper looks like the one with more probabilities in its favor yeah escaping east on a essosi ship where they didnt really care about the nights watch would be your best bet maybe join a sellsword company if youre a ranger dareon would have basically gotten away with it if he hadnt run into arya
asoiaf,not_removed,three be a highly specific nw member witha distinctive skillset but then the lord commander might send someone to track them down someone with a very particular set of skills skills he has acquired over a very long career skills that make him a nightmare for people like nw deserters if the deserters dont go back he will look for them he will find them and he will kill them
asoiaf,not_removed,people probably have successfully run away from the watch before its just really really hard to survive on your own without supplies especially if you are originally from oldtown or somewhere far away its basically suicide with a small chance of working out most people probably dont think its worth it to leave the wall where they are guaranteed a dinner and have a purpose you would also have to dump your black clothes if you wanted to be anonymous and its cooooold outside
asoiaf,not_removed,like how do they get him to stay if you desert after being there for a while people are going to notice that youre gone and come looking for you as i said youd be deserting into a very inhospitable country with very few villages and the few villages you find will be on the lookout for deserters or the head mutineer from crasters show version do you mean locke he was sent by the boltons with a specific mission and seemed to know what he was doing until he got hodored the main character of the video game released a few years back was a nights watch member whos specific job was to hunt deserters that game isnt canon for the books but it was made with martins input i assume some similar position exists in the books but has never been mentioned the nights watch currently has more on its plate than hunting deserters
asoiaf,not_removed,you have to remember its the middle ages kinda life for anyone not rich just kinda sucks staying with the nights watch gives these people a purpose food and shelter they probably wont get that anywhere else
asoiaf,not_removed,lol and he wouldve gotten away with too if it werent for that meddling girl and her wolf dreams
asoiaf,not_removed,even then daeron could have been in a lot of trouble in other eras its true that the nw is looked down on a lot of the south but deserters are generally reviled and if the nw knew where he was they might be able to get the king to request that this deserter be sent back to face justice and then well its a case of how well this deserter is prized by his new city and what its relations with westeros are if they like westeros and like the idea of westeros remembering a favor they did he might find himself sent right back up north its better than most options but its still relying a huge amount on luck or unstable times in westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,steal horsefoodtoolsclothing possible even likely if you are a ranger if you are at castle black way less likely look when jon snow tries to run away as a steward a couple of hours and hes already back and if theres snow theres your trail escaping while theres a snowstorm seems idiotic beyond redemption steal a guide as a hostage if thats the cornerstone of your strategy you are in trouble not only you must find one and be able to capture it you also must be sure hes not lying and wont give signs to the ones that will want to track you down not every recruit is a green pate pig boy very true but at the same time not everybody is mcguyver or rambo and i dont say it as a joke nor as rethorics thats exactly how you need to be to escape in a medievallike society like westeros theres a strong diversity in competences and way too few ways to learn you dont know the north geography unless you are nobleborn or were born into the north period if you dont know it youd better escape beyond the wall and for that you need to be a ranger wildlings hunt rangers for sports fun and duty thats where you are escaping into a hunting ground the north is huge you come upon some cabin or some solo traveler its going to happen not everyone is in a tight nit community lets say you were a northerner hunter before the nw do we agree that this is one of the best starting skillsets to desert except the dareon special of course you must survive in a territory where people are searching for you you light up a fire unless a town is there and those are out of question somebody will come you leave castle black and theres snow on the ground somebody will come and already in the right direction for whatever reason the moment someone tracks you down and starts following your trail youre done hiding tracks against your own collegues the ones that use your very same tricks possible but highly unlikely and you cant come near urban settings who stays away from those bandits running away from the nw to risk getting bolted by some random cuttthroat for a couple of coins because you were not able to convince them to spare youlet you join my point is that to do all that stuff you must already be an exceptional individual not the average able to run to be unnoticed to survive to persuade any eventual people you meet thats mance raider arguably one of the best ranger in the nw since decades im sure it happens it can happen but chances are very slim thats why most of the people dont run away its a delayed death sentence that lasts a few days in the of the cases and you must leave a place where you get food and a bed to get what remember you must have some way to live reasonably afterwards otherwise youre just a random hobo in the woods who struggles to lit a fire without taking a million precautions even to have a meal thats not freedom but to each his own
asoiaf,not_removed,think of criminals who take the black as similar to modern day criminals who post bond if you skip town before your court appearance then you are gambling that you will be able to steer clear of the law in the future night watch deserters are taking a similar risk except its even greater as survival is even more difficult alone in the north to make another modern comparison there are criminals who intentionally commit a crime in order to get sent back to prison meals and shelter are provided for an inmate same as a black brother also you have to remember that at the time of the story the others are an active threat to the nw for the first time in anyones lifetime desertion was likely somewhat less of a problem when wildlings and the cold were the biggest threats to the nw
asoiaf,not_removed,if youre a man of the nights watch youre a wildling as far anyone south of the wall is concerned and woe betide you if you are dressed in blacka deserter for sure
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess the watch would send out ravens to all the nearby towns telling of someone deserting their sentence
asoiaf,not_removed,they have no money to pay for a voyage and ports are the places where they are most likely to get stopped like there is one real northern port so they have to make it to white harbor or try for the neck they encounter the same problems of getting away from the north
asoiaf,not_removed,the main character of the video game released a few years back what game was that i thought there was just the telltale one
asoiaf,not_removed,karl fukin fookin tanner nbsp edit lost my head there
asoiaf,not_removed,oh riiiiiight burn gormans character same thing applies unless youre completely insane to the point of not even being able to consider selfpreservation desertion will probably seem like a bad option it does raise the question of how rapists and serial killers operate in the nights watch you cant just switch that shit off even when youre separated from womeneasy victims i guess thats selfpolicing to a degree if you try to rape or murder a fellow member youre gonna get executed
asoiaf,not_removed,its ollo lophand but youre thinking more of dirk who killed craster in the book and has two hands and prefers small blades like karl tanner
asoiaf,not_removed,theres actually been a number of them you can check the wiki the one im talking about was a thirdperson actionbased rpg it took place more or less in the time frame of the first novel which makes sense it was released right after season one aired and is sort of half in the book canon half in the show canon while apparently not counting for either you alternate protagonists one is a nights watchman who fought for tywin during roberts rebellion and was sent to the wall for disobeying orders hes the one who hunts deserters hes also a skinchanger the other character was an exiled heir to a westerlands house who comes back from essos after his father dies and has to fight his brother for his inheritance hes also a red priest
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think theyd actively be searching for them but the ravens are like an fyi in case they do find someone like they did will i imagine itd be hard for someone like them to escape as they have no where to go no money and no weapons
asoiaf,not_removed,interesting and depressing of note a lot of people were predicting that wed get a completion announcement around december thats when grrm thought hed be done too interesting how insync that isand how long its been since then
asoiaf,not_removed,im making a new bet here are the things which will happen before twow is published ottoman empire will have returned in the form of a dictatorship in official capacity northern ice cap will have completely melted in the summer polar bears will have gone extinct china will have landed a man on the moon spacex will have started commercial crew flights to international space station international space station will have been decommissioned and split into multiple modules for newer space stations half life will have been released and will become the most hated game in history i will have a girlfriend after the nuclear with china the world will enter a new age of peace brought about by united india which will emerge as a new global superpower sherlock season will have been released
asoiaf,not_removed,im more apt to believe he is close to finish if you go by page count but narrativeplot wise is not nearly where he wants to be the arianne chapters released thus far suggest the exact same slow pacing that marred affc and adwd to a certain extent for the record i really like both books especially dance but martin has seemingly been more interested in world building than advancing his plots for over a decade consider that all of the pov characters are back in one book even if he gets particularly bloody and kills many there are still simply too many characters for him to advance plots like in affcadwd theres no more time for multiple travellogues and introducing new plot arcs its time to buckle down and whittle down the list of unresolved plots some of which go back to asos given his refusal to take consistent advice from his editor i fear hes reaching a point where hell have to consider splitting a book again its very hard to write without a basic outline of what you want to accomplish i feel like martins gardener approach while usually goodentertaining has led him into a hole he might not ever get out of
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont remember if i voted in this if i did i assume i guessed late for a long while basically until this summer i thought there was no way martin would let another one of these take longer than dance he will have allowed that to happen by early april even as some one who experienced the full wait for dance and knows that these books now take him roughly five years apiece full stop i managed to fool myself i suppose if you extrapolate that to the wider sub something like of which are postshow readers you get even rosier glasses with people just refusing to accept that the five year waits are a real thing until they experience them themselves
asoiaf,not_removed,come on spring
asoiaf,not_removed,my guess is that will be a fucking great year for us here on asoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,i havent seen people many mention this but i think its telling in his thanksgiving post on not a blog he wrote its been a hard year and a harder month but i still have a lot to be thankful for parris my friends my agents editors and publishers my fans and readers a reasonable assumption here is that things are not going well and that this month there may have been additional set backs
asoiaf,not_removed,spring seems like a good bet
asoiaf,not_removed,ugh i am halfconvinced that they will never be finished we keep getting confirmations of him doing everything but writing for the series and he expressed disappointment in missing his deadline after the long night but hasnt really updated us since but still i am a sweet summer child indeed i remain hopeful albeit almost begrudgingly so at this point that we will see twow by summer
asoiaf,not_removed,its funny this time last year i was convinced wed get a tentative date by the end of the year but was resigned to agree with the older heads that expected a springfall date its now almost years end and who knows if hes even put pen to paper since his last update at this point im preparing myself for either a a release or more likely b never to be released the optimist in me thinks hell work hard on it this coming year and knock it out i think most signs point to him having completed or winds iirc but you also have to factor in editing time him and his assistants poring through the text to make sure he didnt mess anything up plus publication time so while the book may be completed around theres a good chance we wont have our hands on it till around would make sense as it would coincide with the last season airing but im starting to think itll never be released ive come to terms with this as many people on this sub have created some truly magnificent theories that may in fact be better than the final product and im happy grrm is enjoying a fame and fortune not enjoyed by most writers especially not in their lifetimes can any older fans who have been through the great affcadwd drought tell me how long they went until they gave up hope on the next book ever coming out
asoiaf,not_removed,alas the long night continues
asoiaf,not_removed,my guess right now is early i hold a firm belief that the election has depressed mr martin so much that hes focusing on all the bad shit thats going to happen from a trump presidency that hes not writing should you have voted for trump think about how you voted against asoiaf as you lay your head to bed tonight
asoiaf,not_removed,i always thought the wait from adwd to twow would be longer than the wait from affc to adwd and if i had to be right now would bet on can we get an avalon betting pool p
asoiaf,not_removed,im actually not a sweet summer child ive been in this game for over years and i think the books are never coming out not ados not even twow none thats why i cherish the show its all we are going to get
asoiaf,not_removed,im curious if hell find ados easier to write
asoiaf,not_removed,for some reason i put in oct for the release but it has never updated on the list
asoiaf,not_removed,is there any way to check what i guessed i see my name in the list of people who posted a date but i dont remember what i said
asoiaf,not_removed,pps my money is now on a spring release
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm said that his schedule is almost empty next year and will remain so until winds is finished spring is optimistic at best
asoiaf,not_removed,its quite sad when i first started watching the show in i thought he would have twow out before the show got farther than the books not so much my bets are on mid i really hope thats being pessimistic
asoiaf,not_removed,pps my money is now on a spring release i threw up in my mouth a little
asoiaf,not_removed,i think a big part of that was going past books was basically the last chance for grrm to reveal things like rlj even if we acknowledged the longer writing times for affcadwd i suppose we thought its now or never and hes done with the meereenese knot anyways he was on hiatus in but he can write faster if he wants to and then there were those translators giving us false hope
asoiaf,not_removed,my positive thinking guess as to what happened this past year is that once grrm realized back in like december or whenever that he wasnt going to get the book out by the end of the year or before season he decided he could take a step back and calm down and write at his own pace again not trying to meet some deadlines he was probably already stuck in this winterfell knot and other rewrites and has taken the past year to try to work on that and might have even gotten himself into further holes but i like to think we are getting the announcement soon even though many people are getting very pessimistic about it he has to be getting to a page manuscript soon which means his editors will stop him and youd think a year would be enough to fix any of the new knots he got himself into and finesse the rest if he legitimately thought he could get it out before season at one point and even thought he could once given that sept to dec extension it makes me hopeful that there wasnt a ton left he needed to do mostly go back and do rewrites but then he got bogged down in that this could be my wishful thinking but im still holding out hope that well get the book before
asoiaf,not_removed,i will have a girlfriend so never lol jk i hope you find love soon
asoiaf,not_removed,polar bears will have gone extinct you take that back now its worse than sir david attenborough dying at some point and i cant handle even that
asoiaf,not_removed,please try to avoid realworld politics on this sub its a magnet for offtopic flamewars
asoiaf,not_removed,northern ice cap will have completely melted in the summer very optimistic of you to expect it so early
asoiaf,not_removed,after the nuclear with china the world will enter a new age of peace brought about by united india which will emerge as a new global superpower are you sure india wouldnt have caused the nuclear war in the first place
asoiaf,not_removed,sherlock season is airing on new years day
asoiaf,not_removed,i think he should accept the fact he needs books because in my mind he has the material written for book page wise but not story wise it might free him if he doesnt have to trim so much i dont know enough about writing but this is just my general feeling
asoiaf,not_removed,i finished the books in summer and was certain he had worked out the problems that delayed affc and adwd how wrong i was
asoiaf,not_removed,i wish we could see what we guessed id love to see how optimistic i was im pretty sure im not one of the anyway 🌚
asoiaf,not_removed,that assumes reddit will still be a thing in p
asoiaf,not_removed,dae hate branborg
asoiaf,not_removed,he could just have been talking about sucking generally and the election which drove him nuts of course
asoiaf,not_removed,he could also quit being a fucking baby about it it wont affect him at all
asoiaf,not_removed,trump winning is a great grrm kind of twist
asoiaf,not_removed,and then there were those translators giving us false hope you mean grrm having false hope and passing it on to the translatorspublishers
asoiaf,not_removed,he has been writing at his own pace one key per seconds with a pause after each word followed by a minute break at the end of each sentence if he completes a paragraph in one hour he takes a break to gestate over what he has just typed if were lucky the paragraph stays if not the process starts all over as there are none faster on the backspace key than grrm
asoiaf,not_removed,that went from meirl to wholesomememes
asoiaf,not_removed,polars bears are beautiful beasts and i love them but theyre super vicious
asoiaf,not_removed,read my mind
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope everyone reading the comment realises that its merely a joke of how little hope the book readers have still going to edit the comment to accommodate for any potential flamewars
asoiaf,not_removed,i see your subtle civ memes
asoiaf,not_removed,dammit grrm youre lazier than sherlock producers now
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i mean even among older fans like myself there was a broad consensus that the feastdance problem was a unique oneoff phenomenon now its obvious that his late nineties streak was the actual anomaly but as i said most current fans werent in the extremely proverbial trenches from to seeing how badly he was struggling with the story and there was too much of an explosion in optimism and excitement in the wake of the show premiering and dance coming out for people to recognize that martins difficulties are deeply entrenched and not going anywhere it just became an abstraction to most of the fanbase old and new and now its very much a tangible reality
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean im also assuming the world will still be im assuming we wont be consumed by nuclear fire or a super volcano eruption
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps its you that needs the growing up even if he wont be affected by it i suspect he does have empathy for those who will be negatively affected his compassion is unquestionably an ingredient in his art and it would be pretty asinine to expect him to be able to divorce himself from that so you can get another book
asoiaf,not_removed,its like days of mereen
asoiaf,not_removed,tell me rasoiaf said is there any hope for the winds of winter i mean or at least mostly for the winds of winter ubrrrichardnixon put his hand on rasoiafs head there never was much hope he answered just a fools hope as i have been told and when i heard of the translators he broke off and strode to the window as if his eyes could pierce the not a blog in the livejournal the translators he muttered why that way i wonder he turned just now rasoiaf my heart almost failed me hearing that name and yet in truth i believe that the news that george brings has some hope in it
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,now its obvious that his late nineties streak was the actual anomaly as somebody who has actually written for a livingalbeit journalism rather than creative writingnothing focuses your mind quite like actually needing your next paycheck its way too easy to procrastinate otherwise
asoiaf,not_removed,im sure the valyrians assumed the same thing
asoiaf,not_removed,truth is it likely wont affect anyone all that much and honestly at this point old georgie is just looking for anything to do but write
asoiaf,not_removed,this is beautiful
asoiaf,not_removed,i disagree with the first part and will agree with the second part second part first yeah the show and his explosion of fame over the last five years unquestionably contributed to the book taking so long youre not incorrect in characterizing it as years of writing time lost that being said i think even if the show didnt exist winds would still have taken at least four or five years which brings me to our disagreement im of the opinion that martin is dealing with serious narrative problems in winds probably on a scale greater even than what he dealt with in dance we can disregard the fact that he basically rewrote jons entire arc from scratch since everyone always ignores that anyway and just focus on the meereenese knot in which he spent years wrestling with a way to bring together the strands of pov characters in a coherent logical fashion five pov character in one major subplot now think about what logic dictates will happen in winds think of how many subplots and storylines need to start coming together i can think of two potential knots both bigger than meereen winterfell which involves stannis the boltons the freys the manderlys the umbers theon and asha plus in the slightly wider orbit youll have davos rickon everyone at the wall plus bran kings landing which will involve aegon and everyone in his narrative wake connington the golden company arianne colliding with cersei the tyrells the sand snakes the faith militant and eventually dany and her entourage now if dealing with one major subplot involving five povs coming together gave him so much trouble what could possibly make you think that dealing with those two subplots involving more than half of the existing povs coming together would somehow be easier
asoiaf,not_removed,its been very positive he seems to be having a great time with the cinema and the wild cards stuff it hasnt been positive for me or others who just want more news from westeros but theres plenty of positive shit on that blog
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess the title is appropriate with respect to your political knowledge you are a summer child
asoiaf,not_removed,well thank you admittedly all credit goes to
asoiaf,not_removed,i totally agree with you here and i dont have much to add but i was wondering if you could point me towards articles or summaries about the jon arc rewrites everything i find by quick googles is about show divergences but i want to educate myself
asoiaf,not_removed,the only place i can find it is in the very well researched by uwerthead he doesnt include citations but i assume it comes up in one of martins numerous posts about writing dance on his blog between and i dont have the time to trawl for it but if you do have at it
asoiaf,not_removed,and if youre ever so inclined i knocked out a a few months back that filters out football wildcards conventions etc basically anything that isnt asoiaforiented i use it all the time when im looking for something
asoiaf,not_removed,haha cool thanks i was just looking for a nudge in the right direction so this is perfect i mostly am just looking for my asoiaf fix and this sounds like the first thing in some time that i wasnt already familiar with
asoiaf,not_removed,it was on the not a blog in i think or
asoiaf,not_removed,a green turtle in blue wavy water house words well get to it eventually

asoiaf,not_removed,well my family already has a sigil and words as a long time ago we had some sort of nobility here in germany today all that is left is a nice sigil hanging up in my living room and a copy of the letters from king george that my family received the words on the sigil are in latin and says fides et veritas it translates to faith and truth the sigil is off a shield with what looks like a glove of some armour and has some cool design around it httpsdewikipediaorgwikigrafenvonroden if you google the wappen sigil for my name there seem to some slight differences doesnt have the armour hand has some colour the nice one that we have hung up at my house witch colour and made of stone is my favourite my family comes from minden which is a town with people somewhere between hannover and bielefeld dont think anyone from my family lives there now though this was a long time ago the sigil was passed down in my family my father has it now as he was the oldest son my grandfather had it before him since im the oldest son ill get it next

asoiaf,not_removed,ha its more a way to say its none of our business were not involved also that the lady of our house is a cat
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry watching game of thrones online for free is considered piracy and httpswwwredditcomrasoiafaboutrules prohibits this please read our httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikipiracypolicy for more information
asoiaf,not_removed,interesting cause to the people of westeros i think shes be seen as visenya come again stealing the rightfully heirs throne for her own purpose as dany looks set to take faegon out in the same way its rumored visenya did to put mekor on the throne
asoiaf,not_removed,i find myself almost hoping that grrm will finish the dunk egg books before ados probably a horrible and stupid thing to almost hope for
asoiaf,not_removed,arent her eggs from asshai
asoiaf,not_removed,arent her eggs from asshai thats been theorized but we dont know for sure and persuasively argues that viserions cream and gold colored egg may have been the most cherished possession of elaena targaryen who was very briefly married to a certain lord plumm he of the sixfoot member whose alleged cuckholding by aegon the unworthy may have led to tyrion alleging that brown ben has two drops of targaryen blood and a special connection with viserion heres the whole post which is mouthdroolingly fabulous this topic is also revisited in one of the radio westeros episodes
asoiaf,not_removed,thats what illyrio said i think it was him at least but weve learned not to fully trust what that faction was saying back then wasnt the egg that showed up in de blackred like drogons
asoiaf,not_removed,great article the bit about his cloak is particularly interesting and something i havent seen discussed here before its pretty rare to find something in the text thats interesting and hasnt been beaten to death already
asoiaf,not_removed,wasnt the egg that showed up in de blackred like drogons yes see below and further below for the white one but ive never found anything about the green egg dunk dropped the dwarf and picked up the egg just to feel it for a moment it was heavier than hed expected you could smash a mans head with this and never crack the shell the scales were smooth beneath his fingers and the deep rich red seemed to shimmer as he turned the egg in his hands blood and flame he thought but there were gold flecks in it as well and whorls of midnight black
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah the cloak turning from the color of danys eyes to the color of aegons is pretty intense foreshadowing i mean it could be a violet herring but and lady gywn and radio westeros are really fantastic very text based and responsible in their arguments but they still come up with some amazing mindbending stuff lem lemoncloak for example
asoiaf,not_removed,actually i found two not very exciting references theres this about a green dragon whose eggs would presumably be green dunk had heard the story half a hundred times how ser arlan had been just a little boy when his grandfather had taken him to kings landing and how theyd seen the last dragon there the year before it died shed been a green female small and stunted her wings withered none of her eggs had ever hatched some say king aegon poisoned her the old man would tell and this baelas dragon the slender pale green moondancer would soon be large enough to bear the girl upon her back and though her sister rhaenas egg had hatched a broken thing that died within hours of emerging from the egg syrax had recently produced another clutch one of her eggs had been given to rhaena and it was said that the girl slept with it every night and prayed for a dragon to match her sisters question do we know whether a dragon will lay eggs of the same color heres a list of known dragon eggs httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpdragonegg
asoiaf,not_removed,ill have to check out the lem stuff im just now getting into the radio westeros material now that ive exhausted the quality youtube series and bbfishes essays is the lem theory youre talking about the one where hes possibly lonmouth i think thats the name at least the house associated with kisses and lemons
asoiaf,not_removed,the lem theory youre talking about the one where hes possibly lonmouth thats the one they flesh it out really nicely there are also two eps that have bbfish stannis and the battle of fire
asoiaf,not_removed,ive been using the internet since the middle on a im sure george martin knew about it it wasnt a big secret theres a movie called wargames from the early where ferris bueller hacks the us governments computer and initiates the concept has always been their the internet is just a simple phone system limited only by the hardware when george martin wrote the first book a lot of people already knew a little about the internet
asoiaf,not_removed,no offense op but you are really showing your age its not like people hadnt thought of these things long before their inventions the internet was a pretty well known idea when he was writing the books hive minds and collective networks were not an uncommon concept during that time the idea of a deeply permanently connected world can be seen all over the place in history prior to the invention of the internet or smart phones plenty of science fiction novels clearly depict similar ideas well before they were ever made real if anything the invention of the telephone had a big hand in giving the world an idea of an intimately connected network of thoughts and ideas and whatever else before the internet ever did just because we refer to it as the weirwoodnet i dont think this is how grrm envisioned it if anything he envisioned it more like fangorn forest from lotr where the trees could communicate over vast distances of the forest in short amount of time or how druids greenseers could interact with the forest in magical ways the idea of nature being interconnected goes all the way back to pagans before the days of christ you see this in lotr or a good example of that today would be james camerons avatar it was hardly a new concept at all during grrms time
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm has written a number of other stories about collective hive minds that predate asoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,sci fifantasy authors are some of the people outside of the tech industry most likely to have known about the internet before it was widespread
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm has written several science fiction novels where the plot is almost entirely about this topic and these novels came before asoiaf telepathy and hiveminds appear in a lot of his stories
asoiaf,not_removed,youre making the big assumption that grrm had planned to do all this from the very beginning its entirely possible that the nature of weirwoods has changed due to evolving narrative needs as a convenient way for bran and the reader to acquire hidden background information on the other hand the name is a pretty dead giveaway
asoiaf,not_removed,tell that to james cameron and avatars eywa
asoiaf,not_removed,so youre saying this could be the first work of fiction to be visionary when we started reading it yet completely dated by the time we finish reading it
asoiaf,not_removed,theres a movie called wargames from the early where ferris bueller hacks the us governments computer and initiates is that anything like the movie where ferris bueller helps catwoman and a hobo with a shotgun break a curse that turns them into animals depending on the time of day
asoiaf,not_removed,whether it existed or not isnt the question though as a smart nerd i think grrm likely knew of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiarpanet and httpsenwikipediaorgwikiusenet sometime after that what im remarking on is not really an issue of simple chronology but of application even in the early to the internet was a niche thing it was a nascent communication tool the ways in which it would go on to be used were just beginning to be understood that is why i think grrm was ahead of his time laying the groundwork from book of what would be a blood magicfueled westerosi internet
asoiaf,not_removed,im not really seeing weirdwoodnet has a hive mind per se maybe i should be i see it more as a network to be accessed by usersgreenseers the elite few who can tap into its secrets i also see weirdwoodnet as fundamentally different than fangorn forest that was almost like the ents herding quasisentient and mobile trees nothing describing a network for communication over vasts differences its not like httpsenwikipediaorgwikipandotree
asoiaf,not_removed,trees can and do communicate with each other like this all the time they have their own internet of sorts if one tree is running short of nutrients it sends for help and some get passed around its incredible
asoiaf,not_removed,i never pictured bran as a druid i like it he starts out at though and he doesnt level easily because he cant fight and get dp from monsters • iso power leveling will trade acorn paste young direwolfmindless slave partially burned down castle or i can tell you about your past pm with offers
asoiaf,not_removed,it was hardly a new concept at all during grrms time and grrm wasis a scifi author
asoiaf,not_removed,such as only other works of his i read was armageddon rag and a short story or two
asoiaf,not_removed,as mentioned in other comments no doubt but my contention is the idea was relatively new in the average persons consciousness in the early
asoiaf,not_removed,ill check them out happy cake day
asoiaf,not_removed,this is a good point to keep in mind esp with grrms professed gardening style of writing but i also have to say the concept of widearea bidirectional communication has been around since at least the invention of the telephone in the late and since he lives in the western us i bet grrm knew about yearold httpsenwikipediaorgwikipandotree
asoiaf,not_removed,read the conversation we talk about arpanet and rockets those were merely meant as handy landmarks along the road to the internet as we know it today
asoiaf,not_removed,no thats not what im saying at all dig your username though
asoiaf,not_removed,no thats waterworld the sequel to the matrix starring charlie sheen and sylvester stallone as twins one of the twins got all the good genetics and the otherone got all the left over crap to this day nobody knows which is which
asoiaf,not_removed,im not sure if you understood what i said in my other post the internet is the the exact same thing as a telephone system the telephone has been around since before george martin was born the only thing that makes the internet seem new is the advances in computer technology where as we used to only be able to talk on the phone group calls were a thing back then as well though not very common cb radio has been around for a long time as well im not sure if you know thisbecause it seems like aincient technology but when someone used a cb radio everyone with a radio could recieve the message so all im saying is the concept has been around since before george martin was alive it was only limited by technology
asoiaf,not_removed,im not really seeing weirdwoodnet has a hive mind per se maybe i should be i said hive minds and collective networks and yeah its not exactly like fangorn in that sense since humans cant access it but the trees were able to communicate over vast distances to one another fangorn is quickly mobilized during the last march of the ents in a very short time but the idea of nature being a connected network is not a new concept
asoiaf,not_removed,we learn from varamyr that when one warg absorbs another as he does with orell their consciousness or a part at least comes along for the ride if you think of the tree as a crazy old living organism in which a thousands of greenseers have taken their second lives then it really does start to look like a hive mind is br speaking as himself or as the tree i dont think we know for sure yet
asoiaf,not_removed,thats really surprising i kind of always thought thats what most people pictured in regards to the greenseers and weirwoodnet i mean greenseer sounds like the name of a high level druid leader i mean they can skinchange into wolves and other animals druids are known for changeshape into wolves bears birds etc the notable wargs in the series the starks all have animal companions wolves which are a common druid companion they learned their abilities from the children of the forest which are literal forest peopleforest spirits druids and forestsnature go hand in hand they use their magic through trees the weirwoods they worship the trees and their gods use the trees also things like wind water and nature all have been attributed to the old gods which are common themes and elements associated with druids finally the most powerful member of their order is basically one with a fucking tree grrm follows a lot of fantasies tropes even when he subverts them maesters are wizards people from asshai or red priests are like sorcerersconjurerers sorcerers in fantasy are often attributed to fire greenseers are druids we already have warriors rogues barbarians and archers humans fey creatures elveschildren of the forest dwarves not fantasy types giants dragons potential sea monsters dire wolves they even have necromancers and warlocks there may not be orcs and goblins but the dothraki are a close example you have the ever righteous clerics and paladins seen in the faith and the druids and shamans in the rural north its hard not to take fantasy tropes especially ones from lotr but we see it a lot more than we dont jon snow is basically aragorn his sword is basically anduril the flame of the west valyrian steel is basically elvish steel the first men are very similar to the numenorians the wall to the far north is much like minas tiriths great gate is to the east in lotr you have the citadel and order of wizards in got you have the citadel and order of maesters which sam is becoming and playfully wants to become a wizard samwell tarly and samwise gamgee a main friend character to the protagonist of the series named sam who is trustworthy brave and loyal despite acting cowardly and fearful much of the time even though can come through during real crisis both are noteably chubby and fond of food as well both the continent of westeros and middle earth are based on england and the uk the fall of numenor is very very similar to the doom of valyria sean bean dies early on in both
asoiaf,not_removed,a song for lya sandkings he mentions the hrrud in many of his thousand worlds booksshort stories
asoiaf,not_removed,the best example is probably a song for lya
asoiaf,not_removed,a song for lya is probable the most well know bit its a recurring theme in his worlds series
asoiaf,not_removed,most of them are super weird but they will definitely give you a better understanding of how george writes about telepathic characters and their influence on the story characters or species that seem weak and useless are often the ones with true power and influence they are just misunderstood and unlikely candidates for such strong powers
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i certainly dont dispute the possibility of it and the original drafts may have had some kind of magical role for them but in the books it evolves from he can see anything the heart trees see or have seen to he can see anything anywhere from any time like the tower of joy in the shows we even see him warging back through time and bringing about past events which may or may not also happen in the books my point is thats at least as consistent with someone had to see that for the reader to observe so i added it to the trees power by authorial fiat as it is with he planned all along to make weirwoods like a magical internet
asoiaf,not_removed,are you sure youre not thinking of the movie with the terminator and the penguin as twins theres also a sequel where the terminator gets pregnant i think iirc his waterworld breaks and then he has a baby
asoiaf,not_removed,to your point george orwell published httpsenwikipediaorgwikinineteeneightyfour in and it has the concept of mass surveillance through bidirectional communication in the case of this book the state uses twoway httpsenwikipediaorgwikitelescreen
asoiaf,not_removed,and i think youre missing the point of my post yes the technology has been around for a long time its all about what you do with it the application and im saying the application of the internet and grrms conception of weirwood net are novel but i think youre selling the idea of the internet short by saying its the exact same thing as a telephone system its a lot more than that and i think youd be obtuse to really say the internet as we know it in is the same as it was in and the same as it was in again its about application and understanding and then realizing that application the technology that launched deadly rockets from germany to the uk in world war were strikingly similar to the technology that decades later launched satellites into orbit and sent humanity to the moon but youd be missing the point entirely if you said the apollo rocket is the exact same thing as a rocket application potential grasping it and realizing it thats what im talking about here
asoiaf,not_removed,the internet is the exact same thing as a telephone system this was the moment you jumped the shark
asoiaf,not_removed,wow that is something i had never thought of before thanks for pointing this out all the more reason to make a thread like this i am now marveling at the narrative possibilities and they are even more bizarre and exciting than i had thought
asoiaf,not_removed,even though i used to play dungeons and dragons and ive read tolkien and many other fantast books i never though of anyone as a specified class in asoiaf classes like druid and sorcerer are rarely mentioned if they are its off handed when the dothraki call mirri maz durr a witch she hasnt performed a single spell yet i took it as them just insulting her
asoiaf,not_removed,sean bean dies early on in both props
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks ill check it out
asoiaf,not_removed,no no no youre all getting confused termintaor gets pregenent and gives birth to the penguin on waterworld because hes a penguin penguin doesnt like waterworld so goes to live in his new waterworld called the sewers he the gets board here so takes a vacation meanwhile terminator terminates his employment as exterminator and joins the army as a terminator while skirmishing in some jungle he meets a young man called mowgli but is instantly confronted by a predator so terminator vs predator have a sparring match and they find out terminator is terminator and predator is penguin they embrace make up and go for a mojito at the local beach bar moral of the story is one mans junk is another man treasure
asoiaf,not_removed,i understand what you are saying however you arent understanding what i am saying the internet is a simple thing it is limited by technology if you and i both had a radiotransmissionmicrochips installed in our heads that could read our thoughts and then transmit those thought to each other its the same thing as a telephone system its only limited by the hardware have you ever heard of the borg they were hiveminded beings as well through technology they communicated without speaking to each other they were also around before funny thing though george has been writing about hiveminds long before got i know youre just trying to appreciate our favorite author but a lot of the concepts your trying to attribute to him have been around since before he existed
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm wouldnt need to know the internet asis today in order to conceptualize his weirwoodnet the simple potential of the early internet longdistance communication with rerouting of data would suffice tens of thousands of people were already using the internet in for mostly academic purposes even before the internet itself consider that an entirely connected ecosystem wasnt exactly a novel idea isaac asimov thought of gaia a living planet where every tiny speck of matter had consciousness the more organized the matter the more complex said consciousness was humans were the drivers of evolution but the memories of humankind were stored in the rocks because rocks dont change much over millenia and there are a lot of rocks where to store stuff so much for the weirwood storing memories eh
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah its pretty clear some of the parallels i think the druids wizards are by far the most obviously directly related to the ones seen in lotr also if you take a look at jonaragorn its pretty obvious aragorn prior to becoming king was a famous dunedain ranger and jon wants nothing more than to be a ranger when he arrives at the wall although rangers slowly became more of the legolas archtype in fantasy over the years rather than aragorn you can still see how much inspiration grrm draws from lotr
asoiaf,not_removed,and seven times never kill man and guardians from tuf voyaging as well
asoiaf,not_removed,fun fact the two main characters in a song for lya are named robb and lyanna
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe the narrowness of my op is just too narrow ive read and watched a lot of scifi from wells to asimov to gibson all im saying is grrm put the first nodes of what would become weirwoodnet in a novel published in which he began writing in that he was building this communications network and not an allsentient nature consciousness but rather an actual magical network of trees at that time seems to my mind a pretty unique idea at the time btw i see the weirdwoodnet as fundamentally different from the borg
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know if a my post is just not a good idea b im not explaining it well or c people are totally missing the point the idea of inanimate matter having memory or every atommoleculeparticlewhatever having consciousness is certainly not new to grrm yes its commonality in realworld and fantasy world belief systems i dont in any way think the weirwoodnet is anything like that im seeing it more as a natural or bloodsacrificed based memory or communication network that to me is a unique idea in a fantasy novel and its unique to see grrm building nodes of this network into the first book that came out in
asoiaf,not_removed,telepathic cats
asoiaf,not_removed,its not necessarily a unique idea take frank herberts which heavily relies on ancestral memories and being able to access them through rituals and initiations
asoiaf,not_removed,he was called the winged wolf iirc
asoiaf,not_removed,for the tyrion as one of the three dragon heads theory is true perhaps its a reference to him a wingeddragon lionlannister idk just a guess
asoiaf,not_removed,i also sometime misremember what i read check out asearchoficeandfirecom you can check out if it is true
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks everyone who responded
asoiaf,not_removed,lol we all know the plan is seasons the entire point of the earlier post was we got official confirmation from hbo which it now turns out we didnt this is all rather pointless imho after vinyls renewal and then cancellation it should be obvious that if dd want to change their mind on the number of episodes and seasons and it wont be prohibitively expensive they can do whatever they want and hbo will go along with it its called leverage hbo needs got to execute their streaming platform strategy and they will never force out dd because a dd are producing at a higher level than anyone in the tv space right now and b hbos competitive advantage is the perception that they are the best place to launch a prestige show when showrunners shop their ideas to the different outlets
asoiaf,not_removed,the word really seems key if i had to guess id say the info is correct but wasnt supposed to be public
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope it is seasons it seems like a good number to round up on
asoiaf,not_removed,i have had it with these monkeyfighting confirmations on this monday to friday sub
asoiaf,not_removed,as long as they dont stretch it unnecessarily if the content is there to adapt then by all means carry on if the content isnt there and they expand for the sake of it then quality will drop drastically like it did in
asoiaf,not_removed,i think this article isnt saying game of thrones will run longer just that well have something more in the same universe bloys expressed an interest in a spinoff show which again is something we all have heard about a dozen times it will probably be confirmed a few more times after next season too
asoiaf,not_removed,update in comments to buzzfeed an hbo spokesperson said casey did confirm season but didnt really say for sure thats the end weve reached out to the network and will update when we hear back
asoiaf,not_removed,got will end in season of that there should be no doubt at this point then dd will go off to become successful in another realm and have some minor success after to years of mediocrity they will announce a new series in the realm of asoiaf so by we should be watching that
asoiaf,not_removed,also hbo cant force dd to do more than seasons sure they can fire them but i guarantee you the cast who is very fond of dan and david would not continue without them so its either keep dd and end the story when the story ends or go on forced with different showrunners and cast
asoiaf,not_removed,you are probably right or maybe hbo just wants to leave the question in the open in case just eight seasons doesnt work out
asoiaf,not_removed,as long as they dont stretch it unnecessarily if the content is there to adapt then by all means carry on if the content isnt there and they expand for the sake of it then quality will drop drastically like it did in i for one dont think this is an issue at all there is so much content in the books a lot of which was glazed over for expediencys sake that i dont think they could go the the hobbit route
asoiaf,not_removed,season quality wasnt damaged by expansion it was damaged by compression they tried to shove pages into one season and had to cut like of it then they realized that didnt work so they incorporated a lot of cut content into season
asoiaf,not_removed,buzzfeed now the respected choice for actual journalism s
asoiaf,not_removed,id bet thats for something after the show ends maybe a roberts rebellion story or we can hope a dunk and egg story theyve said before the show will only have seasons
asoiaf,not_removed,dd are about as untouchable as anyone in the business right now plus hbo will want them back for whatever the next project is that they want to do hbo really believes in those showrunner relationships hell they gave lindelof a third season and i think theres like of us who actually watch the show
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i think the leftovers is a prime example of just how far hbo is willing to go to maintain their reputation with showrunners
asoiaf,not_removed,dozens of us dozens
asoiaf,not_removed,oh man is leftovers good ive been thinking about watching it
asoiaf,not_removed,ill warn you up front right now the first season is not a smooth ride the show is almost oppressively bleak and morose through most of its rookie year beautifully made with incredible music throughout but there will be things that anger and annoy you buuuuut season two is honestly one of the best seasons of television i can remember you realize you needed all the character development in season one for year two to work
asoiaf,not_removed,first season was good if kind of depressing second season was great id recommend watching it during the long wait
asoiaf,not_removed,first season was good if kind of depressing second season was great id recommend watching it during the long wait
asoiaf,not_removed,first season was good if kind of depressing second season was great id recommend watching it during the long wait
asoiaf,not_removed,first season was good if kind of depressing second season was great id recommend watching it
asoiaf,not_removed,first season was good if kind of depressing second season was great id recommend watching it
asoiaf,not_removed,to quote grrm in the books he is a legendary figure akin to lann the clever and brandon the builder and no more likely to have survived to the present day than they have so he is a legend in the books but we are learning more and more that the legends are leading to something else the show needed a focal point for the big bad guys since most people identify more with a single focal point for evil than just a conglomeration of evil things thats why in shows like got and twd there are masses of evil things walkerszombiesothers but there is always another focal point like the nights king ramsey bolton or negan or the governor then again there is a possibility that the nights king had an heir or made an heir and the title may be passed down or there may be a leader we havent seen yet in the books that the show has already introduced for us
asoiaf,not_removed,only two living people have seen an other sam and gilly grrm has given us one sustained look at the others during the got prologue the prologue reveals the others have a language technology chain of command coordination and code of conduct this strongly implies leadership that sets goals and issues directives so the night king from the stories may not exist however someone that fulfills that role exists in the story the others are not a mindless mass acting on instinct someone is in charge our show writers do not believe such a shadowy and important figure can exist in the story without showing the character once in a while view him as palpatine in star wars he is not shown in the first movie seen as a brief hologram in the second and seen maybe minutes during the return of the jedi yet that character is the driving force of the three movies
asoiaf,not_removed,the show needs a face of the white walkers far more than books imo the book series works even better with the others as a faceless unknowable force we may learn their origins or motivations from other characters but their aspect of nature theme fits well with a lack of command structure and having a villain to go up against in the final battle may cheapen them as antagonists when said antagonists must be presented front and center to establish them in a visual medium having a focal point like the nights king is a must and since planetos is a place of myth and hearsay his origins and survival are always up in the air
asoiaf,not_removed,im very confident that the night king will not be in the books the show needs a focal point for the antagonists which the books arent going with
asoiaf,not_removed,i have a theory about the night king in the books compared to his presence in the show but given im on my phone and am not entirely sure how to spoiler tag for something more involved than main ill just say that i think the shows nk may have more relevance to the books than we know
asoiaf,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if nights king is a title passed down from other to other
asoiaf,not_removed,he obviously is a character in the books the problem is people are thinking of a different character the great other has been mentioned in the books by melisandre even as rhllors rival god of ice and death the problem is that the show doesnt call them the others but white walkers so having their leader be called the great other wouldnt make any sense thus a new name was needed so they used the night king the nights king with an s is a legendary lord commander of the nights watch in the book lore but the night king without s is the shows name for the great other i honestly still dont understand how people keep equating the nights king with the night king they share a name yes but its pretty clear that the night king the great other only a new name was needed for the show and night king fits in pretty well and its badass as shit
asoiaf,not_removed,lann the clever tyrion clever lannister brandon the builder bran stark
asoiaf,not_removed,he is a legend in the books i believe it is confirmed that the one mentioned in the books will not be the one leading the others but if anyone has anything disproving that statement i welcome the link
asoiaf,not_removed,the show will be a watered down version of the books does not sound like the show will mention the lord commander of the watch i think its silly to assume the night king has nothing in common with the nights king some people lose their minds when others even speculate theres an apostrophe god dammit
asoiaf,not_removed,the show needed a main character for the white walkers i think its very lame but most of the show is anyway
asoiaf,not_removed,something that has always annoyed me about this quote is the groupthink in the fandom that interprets it to be more definitive than grrms words actually support george said that he is a legendary figure ok he also said the nights king is no more likely to have survived to the present day than have ok every take i have read draws at least one of three conclusions from these statements night king in the show and nights king in the books are completely different characters because they have different names im sure they are different just given the normal showbook tension but i dont think the quotation necessarily supports the conclusion that they are different characters its not included in the quote above but george prefaces this statement by saying as for the nights king the form i prefer i think an equally plausible reading is that they are the same character but george prefers calling him the nights king instead of the night king simple as that night king in the show and nights king in the books are different because the nights king is only a legend not an unreasonable conclusion but again not the only plausible one especially given the apparently extended lifespans of some of the geotd figures i think its perfectly plausible that being a legendary figure and surviving to the present are not mutually exclusive night king in the show and nights king in the books are different because the nights king is only a legendary figure who is no more likely to survive than bran and lann again not unreasonable to conclude this means that all figures are gone in the books but george did not go that far the nights king is no more likely to have survived in other words the likelihood of the nk surviving is equal to or lesser than the likelihood of bran andor lann surviving but he does not tell us what that likelihood is and especially with respect to some of the excellent bran stark is bran the builder existing in multiple times theories that likelihood could very well be high none of this is to say that the conclusions above are wrong i just dont think they are as obvious or definitive as some make them out to be one way to think of it if we get twow and the nights king turns out to be the same as the night king in the show and still in existence would you say that george lied i dont think those events would render this quotation a liejust a cagey precisely worded statement that leaves open several possibilities in other words classic george just my thoughts please pardon any formatting im new here
asoiaf,not_removed,interesting take thank you
asoiaf,not_removed,so now that the show has made its villain years old how likely is it that any of those legendary figures survived to the present day
asoiaf,not_removed,grenn has seen an other also he was there when sam killed one
asoiaf,not_removed,or they are hive minded or they have such inhumanly strong group cohesion that they dont need anyone to be in charge because they are able to work together so well
asoiaf,not_removed,hi first of all thanks for remembering to use spoiler tags its always appreciated by the mods however plot leaks are not allowed to be discussed anywhere except in the unless they have been confirmed by production leaks from a reputable source such as watchersonthewallcom for example s jon and dany meeting up has been confirmed kit emilia were filming together but your point about the nights king has not been confirmed but feel free to correct me if i have missed a production update
asoiaf,not_removed,that wouldnt make sense the title started off with a human who wasnt even a leader among others
asoiaf,not_removed,the great other is a figure in melisandres religion and there is no inherent proof that he exists anymore than rhllor exists
asoiaf,not_removed,well put i think it is weird people think he is a shortcut to a villain and cant be a shortcut to something else in the story
asoiaf,not_removed,can we please stop with this idea that the gods are real characters in asoiaf its not malazzan you know george has said countless times that religions in the world of ice and fire are like religions in our world some people believe some dont and thats it there is no great other save in the red priests and rhllor believers minds only magic exists and some religions are built around it of course what im saying is not exactly true because some gods were confirmed to be real in a way the old gods who are just the artefact of past green seers and not exactly gods
asoiaf,not_removed,he doesnt the wall was built to keep others away he was manning the wall so how can he be the leader of white walkers
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think the other figures did they were mostly men who just did great things bran the builder made the wall lann the clever swindled his way into creating a great house basically the other figures we see are bloodraven who has been kept alive as the three eyed raven then there is mel we dont know how old she is and there is the possibility that quaithe is shiera seastar which if she is then she is as old as br roughly so i do see examples of extreme old age but i think the legendary people are just that left to legends not to say that someone in this timeline wont mirror their acts or as some say he is soandso reborn
asoiaf,not_removed,so now that the show has made its villain years old thats not true its not that hes just a legendary figure in the books thats not the only difference they are simple two different people in the books the night king was not a white walker he was simply a person lord commander of the nights watch garrisoned at the nightfort who took a wife whose skin was white and eyes were blue possibly a white walker but its never definitively stated the night king in the show is not the same person as the nights king in the book so theres no reason to assume the nights king is years old because theyre not the same person
asoiaf,not_removed,i have always wondered people call collective consciousness as a hive mind hives and collective insects have queens that form colonies that scatter without them just wondering how you can have a collective with no leadership that said i think i know where you are headed that would be interesting if there was an alternate collective consciousness similar to the old gods even there blood raven serves as the king i have never really understood the whole collective thing with no one to make final decisions
asoiaf,not_removed,ah my mistake i fixed the post back up
asoiaf,not_removed,well its a legend from years ago no reason why the king of the others cant be called the nights king
asoiaf,not_removed,yes there is no proof but the fact the others have a leader in the show indicates the large possibility of them having one in the books too and who else would it be beside the great other or a being that represents him
asoiaf,not_removed,considering that the night king isnt going to speak i think he very much exists for cinematic purposes
asoiaf,not_removed,of course what im saying is not exactly true because some gods were confirmed to be real in a way the old gods who are just the artefact of past green seers and not exactly gods but thats what im saying if i didnt make myself clear the others have a leader and that leader is the great other just the first other created if like the show hes not a god but hes seen as one by the faith of rhllor im not saying the leader of the others is a god im saying hes seen as one by the red priests this being that they see as a devil figure to their god rhllor is the very real and although not godly really powerful leader of the others and its this character who hasnt appeared yet in the books that was dds inspiration for the night king in the show they just used a different name for him because of the reasons i stated above
asoiaf,not_removed,the wall was built to keep others away he was manning the wall this logic doesnt even check out based on what is already written in the book it seems pretty clear he was working with or for the others corpse queen war against the nights watch etc
asoiaf,not_removed,well said
asoiaf,not_removed,there is no night king in the books the books have a legendary nights king i know that seems like an overly nit picky distinction but people seem genuinely confused by this the books never mention a night king and the night king of the show is a completely different character than the legendary nights king of the books
asoiaf,not_removed,i think you are limiting your possibilities here by saying he is definitely not the same
asoiaf,not_removed,i think anything is possible at this point there is no reason to assume anything but there is definitely enough for speculation the fact that the show made him years old doesnt mean he is the night king but it should punt grrms no more likely to survive quote but either way he is not simply a person without going too tinfoil he boned a corpse called her his queen gave her is soul with his seed and was enough of a dick to be the only one whose name cant be mentioned
asoiaf,not_removed,hives and collective incests have queens that form colonies that scatter without them just wondering how you can have a collective with no leadership remember that queen is a bit of a misnomer when referring to insect societies the queen is not issuing commands and determining objectives she is not a ruler in any way she is a breeder the other insects serve her in the sense that they ensure the queens safety and comfort so that she can produce the organisms necessary to keep the society working weve attached mankinds interpretation of hierarchy and social structure implicitly by merely calling that bug the queen but the reality of the hives structure is that she is a breeder and not a ruler edit nice freudian slip here very appropriate for the sub haha hives and collective incests
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm writes about it a lot essentially the way hive minded collectives work is that no one makes the final descision because all thought and experience is shared and all interest is unified the point of it is that it flies in the face of individualism the case with the old gods is a bit different bloodraven isnt really king of the old gods he is the avatar connected to a network of consciousness
asoiaf,not_removed,well i could be wrong but i disagree with the initial premise a lot of things change from book to show particularly where magic is concerned and the existence of the night king seems very much about creating strong cinematic moments the others being given a leader isnt a strong indication they will have one in the books particularly in light of grrms commentary post hardhome to me the subtext of what grrm was saying seemed very clear cut that the night king character in the show would not be appearing in the books i dont think its just about the same character with a different name for example the time since the long night has been decreased substantially on the show meanwhile the three eyed raven has been aged up its not brynden rivers so i dont think there will be an original other that is still alive and leading the others in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,he is no more likely to speak than any other white walker
asoiaf,not_removed,i fail to see how a religion born at the other side of the known world would know of a living being north of the wall in present times i mean sure twoiaf points to the long night being a global event with repercussions everywhere and there are similarities in all the worlds mythos but what the red priests consider responsible for the long night ie the great other is just their version of evil not a real character just as the old gods dont exist the northerners just notice magical stuff from weirwood and dead greenseers and attribute it to gods
asoiaf,not_removed,he was the lord commander of nights watch he fell in love with a corpse queen later besides brandon the breaker defeated him according to legends the only way i see this having any connection to white walkers is that he had a son with the corpse queen and she took her child with her before the joramum and brandon the breaker defeated the nights king who according to nan was also a stark and mayhap brandon ooff too many brandons and i can think of all sorts of comical scenarios when brandon goes to war with brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,that was literally the entire point of my post
asoiaf,not_removed,the fact that the show made him years old doesnt mean he is the night king but it should punt grrms no more likely to survive quote the show has made the events of be long night approximately a thousand years old not years this absolutely does not negate martins quote we have to be willing to accept that the show will include changes
asoiaf,not_removed,but either way he is not simply a person without going too tinfoil he boned a corpse called her his queen gave her is soul with his seed and was enough of a dick to be the only one whose name cant be mentioned the nights king of the books may not even have existed
asoiaf,not_removed,then it could be all programming and instinct no decisions like schools of fish reacting to predators in that case there are no real thoughts just reactions to situations if a new situation develops fall back to this default program programming occurs randomly like genetic mutations with no consideration or positive or negative the conversation sounds like westworld to me
asoiaf,not_removed,yet decisions are made i guess these are some of the differences between one order of life of life and another
asoiaf,not_removed,well if im correct and thats whats going to happen i doubt grrm would spoil it on his blog from many interviews we can see he hates when people guess whats going to happen so i see it as he trying not to ruin the surprise of his appearance in twowados
asoiaf,not_removed,thats exactly my point though the others are homogenous and lack a distinctive culture or rea individuality much like a perfected unsullied martin doesnt seem to have a need to give them a leader in the books because based on what they currently are it doesnt actually make a narrative difference if they do or dont have one even on the show the night king serves no function except to put a face on the threat and to create visually impactful scenes think about how leaders work in the real world they are indicative of a need to reconcile individual interests amongst a group they are descision makers and policy makers if the others had a leader then the implication would be that their leader is in some way responsible for the collective actions of the group that perhaps with a different leader the others would make different choices as a group or behave differently or that if the leader were to die then the others couldwould somehow change direction the implication is huge if the leader of the others is the great other then the implication is that the others have been under the rule of leader for their entire history and this that leader essentially becomes a scapegoat for their entire history whether good or bad
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean if like the show the great other is the first other and has existed for thousands of years how the rhllor religion fits with the others is personally one of the main questions im looking to get an answer to but its clear they are related melisandre and the red priests in general know of azor ahai the long night the coming war for the dawn they relate their devil with ice and the dead wights i fail to see how them knowing of the great other is weird if they already know all that i have a on how they are related but that just may be a lot of tinfoil though its clear there is some connection between these two factions
asoiaf,not_removed,he was defeated but we are never told he is killed or destroyed same goes for the others they havent been seen since son of nights king sounds like a wild scenario thats some valyrian foil i like that i just think its weird that people cling to that grrm comment no more likely to survive when the show is already telling us he is thousands of years old
asoiaf,not_removed,yes but you called him the book character the night king its the nights king
asoiaf,not_removed,i didnt say negate i said punt as much as the show is only an adaptation of the story theyre showing us a character that has been around since the long night whether that is years years or whatever your interpretation of the timeline is the show has absolutely included changes but its crazy to shut down speculation when theres a pretty yuge detail central to the story
asoiaf,not_removed,in that case he is not simply a man either
asoiaf,not_removed,then it could be all programming and instinct no decisions no not really i recently read a comment written by an entomologist who stressed the idea that insects are not mere machines he gave an example of ants in laboratories who learned how to solve a problem and then taught that solution to other ants they are creatures of limited intelligence and birthassigned social structure like the caste system though in times of dire need i think that some insects roles can change not sure on that point they are not organic robots
asoiaf,not_removed,theoretically all decisions are collective
asoiaf,not_removed,much as i admire tolkien and i do admire tolkien — hes been a huge influence on me and his lord of the rings is the mountain that leans over every other fantasy written since and shaped all of modern fantasy — there are things about it the whole concept of the dark lord and good guys battling bad guys good versus evil while brilliantly handled in tolkien in the hands of many tolkien successors it has become kind of a cartoon we dont need any more dark lords we dont need any more here are the good guys theyre in white there are the bad guys theyre in black and also theyre really ugly the bad guys grrm
asoiaf,not_removed,well agree to disagree i guess personally it would piss me off if the simplistic and dualistic vision of the red priests comes to be true its so not georges style even the show simplistic in nature delved a little into that by having melisandre doubting her god and beliefs and completely changing her attitude towards her mission
asoiaf,not_removed,well unless you think lann the clever is running about then hes gone and the nk wasnt a leader of the others he was allied to them
asoiaf,not_removed,ooooooh i put the s by the wrong name that surely invalidates my entire post
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont understand are you saying that the show night king being sold as he is makes it more likely that characters like the book nights king and lan the clever are still alive because i dont think it does at all
asoiaf,not_removed,theory only one of our misunderstandings is how nonmammals such as incests make critical decisions at some point decisions must be made when natures information provides no guidance genetics can hardwire such situations however the reason the entire world is not control by such a collective centralized mind is because it has no intelligence and no memory it is one of the great flaws in the collective mind theory nature has decided not to go in that direction if experience intelligence and knowledge could be collectivized collective memories would lead to almost perfect decision making is such a collective that is not what we see well believe as you please
asoiaf,not_removed,sounds like thats on you for assuming they have to be evil
asoiaf,not_removed,leader allied controlled by whatever he can be a shortcut to a villain but the other details must be compared specifically
asoiaf,not_removed,i didnt say your post was invalid i was just clarifying i know this seems like an overly nit picky distinction but people seem genuinely confused by this i wasnt sure if you were making a typo or were confused but the fact that the s changes the name to refer to a totally separate character has caused a lot of confusion in the fandom even respected theorists go calling the show night king the nights king because that is the name they are sued to using not realizing that they are conflating two separate entities entirely
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont understand are you saying that the show night king being sold as he is makes it more likely that characters like the book nights king and lan the clever are still alive i am saying point blank that the show gave us an ancient character you can interpret more likely however you want
asoiaf,not_removed,they dont have to be evil they also dont have to have a leader and they probably dont
asoiaf,not_removed,the s shouldnt be what matters in this discussion i clearly explained the difference between the show character and the book character so no one should wonder whether or not im confused just because of a misplaced s to anyone familiar with the subject simply referring to the book character or the show character should be enough to make it clear which one is being talked about to anyone not familiar with the distinction the explanation requires much more than telling them one has an s at the end while the other doesnt therefore the s is entirely irrelevant
asoiaf,not_removed,yes the show gave us an ancient character a character who martin has heavily implied isnt even in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,i think we can all stand to just use the correct terms i think youre being overly defensive ive seen people mess up those terms before or use the terms interchangeably and its not accurate so i made a clarification it seems like youre trying to argue that its not incorrect to call the character by the wrong name as long as you know what youre talking about again not trying to be anal just trying to say that people confuse the terms all the time and so its worth publicly correcting if not for you then for other people who might read your post and think that the terms are interchangeable
asoiaf,not_removed,again if youre trying to explain the difference between the two characters to someone youre going to have to go a lot more in depth than just saying one ends in an s and the other doesnt if someone knows the difference between the two than the s is irrelevant if they dont then youre going to need to explain a lot more than the difference in spelling
asoiaf,not_removed,youre presuming that everyone has the same idea of the characters as you do which ive found isnt always the case the nights king is a legendary character and his story is inherently subject to scrutiny since the idea of a female other is highly suspect many in the fandom no longer trust this story at all and there are in fact a lot of people who suspect that the nights king will turn out to be alive and have essentially the exact same role as the night king has in the show as a man who was turned into the first other now i dont share this belief and i think we have the same idea of the two characters but since the events of ancient legend arent confirmed and people have widely different ideas of what will come to be i think the most prudent thing to do is to just use the right terms when youre talking about the darth maul looking guy in the show say night king because he has never been called the nights king on the show when youre talking about the legendary figure from the books say nights king because he has never been called the night king in the books it avoids unnecessary confusion to just use the right terms and then if necessary elaborate further on the differences you believe exist between the two characters rather than pointlessly use the s or lack thereof in the wrong place
asoiaf,not_removed,it always makes me think of helen hunt kelen kunt
asoiaf,not_removed,shed be too honorable
asoiaf,not_removed,if you change the first k to a v you get vyle kunt
asoiaf,not_removed,there is no way jaime doesnt start calling him that at some point in twow
asoiaf,not_removed,doing an affc reread right now and i couldnt agree more
asoiaf,not_removed,i always thought that the egg she had for breakfast that had a dead chick in it was to also signify her recent miscarriage but i dont remember enough about it right now
asoiaf,not_removed,she hasnt been with jamie since the death of joffrey iirc so i dont think she is shes losing her figure a bit unless shes laced up tight in a dress if she is though and it is discovered then it would really throw the kingdom into a tailspin joff is killed in at the first of the year and the last bit we have is about months later i think so if she was pregnant from jamie then she would have been father along now if she were pregnant by a kettleback that would be more recent and could be a possibility shes around so yeah it is possible but i dont think it will happen if it did that would really be a blow to jamie and would really break him down
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think so because she was menstruating while that sex happened human eggs only last hours sperm last up to days but are very weak by the end so possible but very unlikely
asoiaf,not_removed,geniugh bless you
asoiaf,not_removed,if she is pregnant its a little kttleblack
asoiaf,not_removed,is she really i thought shed be more like joffrey was only what and ahe probably had him around or
asoiaf,not_removed,sperm can live inside you for and up to days you could have sex towards the end of your bleeding and then actually conceive or days later with your early ovulation the probabilities of getting pregnant while on your period are low but the possibilities are there
asoiaf,not_removed,lol enough was tired
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei was born in ac and joffrey died in ac by the end of adwd cersei is roughly
asoiaf,not_removed,she was born in and its now so it would put her at or depending on when her birthday falls
asoiaf,not_removed,thats actually really scary this comment also goes to show how bad sexed is throughout the us so many of usincluding me have misinformation
asoiaf,not_removed,i guessed but i always feel obliged to do it anyhow p
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i remember them teaching that periodno baby end of story they didnt mention that part i only found out when a friend of mine in high school many years ago got pregnant during her time of the month mind was blown and then followed with disappointment about how kids are taught
asoiaf,not_removed,the possibility of pregnancy is minute most of the sperm are ejected with the menstrual blood almost immediately if a rhythm cycle is your only preferred method of birth control then the period week is the proverbial sweet spot im not a big fan but then again as a rough skank once said to me if a horse can tromp through mud then a horse can tromp through blood
asoiaf,not_removed,everyone always thinks its sam or tyrion but believe it or not its daenerys is by far my favorite grrm interview right around the mark he starts going into how when he was a kid his family was very poor but before he was born his family had been very wealthy so he knew he came from greatness even though they were near poverty at the time he then relates how this inspired him to write for dany and that it is in fact her that he most resembles at least in his own mind regardless of what you think i highly recommend watching its a great interview
asoiaf,not_removed,lord manderly to the point that when im reading about him i have a picture of george with medieval green clothes in my mind
asoiaf,not_removed,rodrick the reader badass ironborn captain scythes and ships and the old way but would rather just sit in his library with a book
asoiaf,not_removed,sam although they arent similar in age grrm did mention that if he could identify with someone in the series it was sam give the guy some credit he isnt a hideously disfigured dwarf and he may have an extra pound or two on him but he is no lord manderly
asoiaf,not_removed,i think there are traces from many characters in him but mostly he is samwell a gentle and wise man i see some irony in sams depiction irony towards himself grrm i remember an interview in which he told that his family has lost some fortune a building or some kind of a business and everytime he passed that building he thought about it the lost kingdom of his family talk about daenerys and jon only jon doesnt know it im not a native speaker of english
asoiaf,not_removed,the tickler grrm is a master of the art of torture hes so good that ive begun to think that i actually enjoy this wait for twow
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion from acok definitely as he is his favorite character and able to write him well and fast meaning that he relates to the character very well
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime lannister shut up
asoiaf,not_removed,obviously the late lord frey
asoiaf,not_removed,this guy is lord to fat to sit a horse lord wyman manderly
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree its a mix between sam and tryion leaning more on tyrions side
asoiaf,not_removed,i think an aged hot pie would end up looking more like grrm than any of the other characters but im not sure if he would be a good storyteller
asoiaf,not_removed,bran or current day bloodraven grrm is the epitome all powerful shut in
asoiaf,not_removed,varys he knows and sees all master at manipulation
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe his father thought writer is a pussy job and tried to send him to the marines
asoiaf,not_removed,haha i could see this
asoiaf,not_removed,im trying to mostly save time because most ep are an hour its ironic that youre trying to rush through it while everyone else is desperate for any tiny morsel of additional content in any case blackwater is a great episode and was written by grrm himself if youre looking for an episode to skip try s where yara visits the dreadfort or any of the episodes that focus on dorne since all of its plotlines wind up getting aborted
asoiaf,not_removed,no
asoiaf,not_removed,no its one of the greates episodes in the series and grrm personally wrote the scripts also come with me and take this city
asoiaf,not_removed,this is one of the better episodes in the whole darn thing if you want to skip anything skip everything after season and you will be a lot happier
asoiaf,not_removed,wtf no
asoiaf,not_removed,uh if youre going to watch the show and watch every episode youre definitely a casual so why would you care about the story anyway why even watch the show the black water episode is one of the best episodes in the show and the battle of black water was better in the show than the book imo except for some major changes but it visually was awesome
asoiaf,not_removed,ugh why didnt they just call her asha such a nice name for a nice character in the novel
asoiaf,not_removed,oh thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,removed for uncovered spoilers beyond the scope as set by op happy to approve the comment if you want to edit in spoiler tags instructions in the sidebar if you need them
asoiaf,not_removed,nah season is bad ass season has some really excellent elements from the books but also so completely dumb stuff also i think overall season is better than season
asoiaf,not_removed,really everything after that because the show become unwatchable after that
asoiaf,not_removed,removed for uncovered spoilers beyond the scope as set by op happy to approve the comment if you want to edit in spoiler tags instructions in the sidebar if you need them

asoiaf,not_removed,hi talking about grrms health in that way is not appropriate topic of discussion for rasoiaf removed
asoiaf,not_removed,the iron throne is made up of regular swords not valyrian steel
asoiaf,not_removed,the swords in the iron throne are not valyrian steel
asoiaf,not_removed,the iron throne is made up of valyerian swords right nope regular old iron
asoiaf,not_removed,well its called the iron throne for a reason friend though i really liked your idea that would have been quite ironic for them to have to melt down the iron throne to help in the fight against the others
asoiaf,not_removed,i think they would have called it the valyrian steel throne if it had been made with valyrian steel swords
asoiaf,not_removed,what everybody else said but it seems that the uniqueness of valyrian steel is derived from the spells and possible blood sacrifice required as well as dragonfire in its initial forging well there are dragons in the world again there are shadow binders and red priestesses theres tobho mott and theres a giant chair made out of hundreds of swords its possible it could be dismantled and repurposed all the tools to do so are now available and the need to do so is once again upon westeros i also think that the dusty forgotten black plate targaryen armors in the basement of the red keep will also be repurposed in the same way as the iron throne in the image of the armor euron has now as described in the new aeron sample chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,thank you all for replying i looked up as many references to the throne that i could find and none specify what type of swords used but they almost certainly were not valyerian steel but it would have been maybe will be still an interesting twist if they had to dismantle it for the materials especially if they find a way to turn them into valyerian steel if dragons breath is the key then that would be interesting after all drogon is coming
asoiaf,not_removed,im going to agree with this hypothesis maybe the dragons burn the thrown room like dannys vision and the swords become molten valyrian steel edit maybe a king is sitting on the throne when a dragon burns it the iron fuses with dragon fire and kings blood both magical things in asoif making
asoiaf,not_removed,so there are only two players in this game blood raven who controls everyone and his protege who is everywhere
asoiaf,not_removed,i watched all of this guys videos very thoughtprovoking and nicely researched bring on twow later the discussion here is getting very tinfoily but the videos themselves are much less so consisting more of quotes from the text and interesting little details and less of leaping to wild theoretical conclusions
asoiaf,not_removed,yes yes yes yes yes finally someone else sees this and yes bloodraven did set up jon to die so that he could ressurrectcontrol him like he does stoneheart
asoiaf,not_removed,ight so someone else is finally thinking along the same lines as me about jons story good yes the whole thing is all set up by bloodraven bloodraven has made a deal with the children to use their powers to put targaryens back on the throne in exchange for getting rid of the wildlings bloodravenchildren summon the illusion of scary others not real to scare wildlings bloodraven sends mance to unite the wildlings remember that mances best friend is qhorin bloodraven sends the direwolf mother to the starks so he can manipulate them this includes using mance to hire the catspaw mance says in asos he went to winterfell with a bag of silver catspaw had silver who is stopped by bloodraven controlling summer jon goes to the wall and bloodraven does the zombie trick you just said to get everyone to come north bloodraven tells qhorin to bring jon to mance this is why jon is chosen for the ranging remember its ghost who helps jon kill qhorin qhorin knew he would die all along at this point ygritte has been planted there by mance who knows jon is coming to seduce jon to create sympathy for the wildlings in his thoughts bloodraven then sends the others illusions and some zombies to the fist to drive the nights watch back the children want every human gone from north of the wall then he sends an other illusion after sam controls the ravens to warn him and like you said had already given him the glass dagger which he lets sam use to kill the other illusion to reveal the power of the dragonglass mance at this point is able to convince jon that the wildlings should be let through so he then sends jon back to the nights watch bloodraven then gets jon appointed lc with the raven snow trick stannis was a twist probably but anyway the wildlings are let through and have jons support mance then glamours and goes south where he then forges the letter from ramsay which is specifically worded to get jon to break his vows and thus be killed by the watch this is done so that br can now ressurrectpossess jon so that when jon eventually becomes king he can be under the influence of br and maybe even the childrens hivemind directly boom
asoiaf,not_removed,when you say protege who do you mean cold hands ch is just bloodravens creature if you do mean cold hands im not sure what you been by everywhere since he is places where jon is beyond the wall and if jon can get to these places in these time spaces why cant cold hands
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks really appreciate your comment i like to think i stay pretty close to the books i also try and mention when im purely speculating
asoiaf,not_removed,bloodraven did set up jon to die so that he could ressurrectcontrol him like he does stoneheart lol what
asoiaf,not_removed,and was a part time job
asoiaf,not_removed,this seems unlikely
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah no
asoiaf,not_removed,brandon stark
asoiaf,not_removed,this is literally a serious entirely about conspiracies
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty sure i just solved the whole series so how is it unlikely
asoiaf,not_removed,oh why is bran everywhere
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly and if lsh is bloodraven why has she spent her entire time while undead killing freys isnt that something that proves shes acting on her own free will
asoiaf,not_removed,wed better take it seriesly then
asoiaf,not_removed,because you just make assumptions based on pretty much nothing at all then proceed to use them as basis for further assumptions and expect people to go with it
asoiaf,not_removed,its shit writing is why its unlikely you make the main conflict of the series cotf vs wildlings when we have seen zero conflict between them if anything they are bros as the wildlings revere the same gods as the children they never really violated the pact at the gods eye that was the andals south of the wall your plot also reduces the great other harbinger of death and apocalypse to a mummers farce
asoiaf,not_removed,bran is claimed to be a brandon the builder b nights king lord commander c lord of the light d the one who whispered to aerys burn them all e he was the one who torched summerhall f he was the brandon stark who had a wildling father g some even argue he was brandon stark ned starks older brother but then he couldnt mess with his own mother so he got uncle brandon stark killed so you see he is everywhere
asoiaf,not_removed,they are beyond the wall encroaching upon the habitat of the children who have already retreated so far from their past control of all westeros if the humans are not contained south the children will be driven completely extinct in my true accurate understanding of the series one major conflict is cotf vs wildlings and the other is bloodraven vs the lords of westeros and br and cotf are teaming up to win both just think about it the entire northern plot has revolved around the wildlings so far that would all be pointless if it wasnt really about them the point of the series is that people are easily manipulated hes saying that grand evils and myths are lies just like in real life it is so obviously how this all must end
asoiaf,not_removed,ahh ive only ever heard a i think the trouble is with stuff introduced in the show like time travel it leads to speculation because it feels like anything is possible hopefully in the books powersabilities are more boxed in and finite i do worry though
asoiaf,not_removed,she can kind of speak not easily and very few words
asoiaf,not_removed,theyve been living together peacefully for years mate
asoiaf,not_removed,they were biding their time they didnt have the power to succeed until bloodraven came to them how could any species possibly consider losing all of their land peace
asoiaf,not_removed,rasoiafcirclejerk is a better medium for this
asoiaf,not_removed,im expecting hot pie to bake a dope ass pie and give it to the others and save everyone
asoiaf,not_removed,a pie stuffed with habenaro and ghost peppers enough heat to burn the white walker hordes
asoiaf,not_removed,you know i was thinking of a bake off but sure i like yours too
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think lsh would serve any purpose at this point in the show theyre in the endgame now wrapping things up theyd have to kill cersei then somehow have her revived and theres no real focus on eurons magical interests so far in the show and then have her do stuff and then probably die again it just seems to me there is neither the need nor the time for that
asoiaf,not_removed,lady stoneheart hype is dead it is known
asoiaf,not_removed,valid point
asoiaf,not_removed,ha fair
asoiaf,not_removed,hi as our httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikispoilertagsystem states threads posted in must include production info in the original post or a request for production information id recommend you repost with spoilers main or extended
asoiaf,not_removed,that would be shitty to be honest with you all of this hype waiting for the conclusion of the books for literally years probably years by the time season hits only to have it overshadowed by the show revealing the overall ending i would really be upset and am definitely not watching season before i read ados i probably wont watch season either if twow isnt out yet ill live in a cave for a few years if i have to just so im not spoiled by the show
asoiaf,not_removed,so you are never watching season
asoiaf,not_removed,everyones got their thing i personally dont mind spoilers as they only tease a brief glimpse of the end even if they spell out what happens exactly the journey to the endas to how and why something is happening is more rewarding imho
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe victarion is going to get one for sure but dont have a clue which one no idea what will happen to the one unless vic goes full on them which would be awesome im coming round to the idea that the dance of dragons isnt going to have literal dragons on both sides but its more a confirmation that dany and aegon will fight one another
asoiaf,not_removed,what if euron takes drogon and dany has to use her skills she learned with drogo on euron to get drogon back she feigns an interest in him and allows him to think hell be her king and she will turn on him and take over his forces just like the slavers and the unsullied she has a habit of infiltrating warrior societies and appropriating their assets
asoiaf,not_removed,so true but come on the warlocks from qarth using blood magic before battles should pay off unfortunately
asoiaf,not_removed,must be an iron born thing
asoiaf,not_removed,in twow preview chapter of eurons brother pov he has a vision that eurons blows his dragon horn while sitting on the throne and that dragons and krakens bowed down to him
asoiaf,not_removed,theres a that viserion the gold white one will wind up with brown ben plumm so id bet on rhaegal being the one who comes when vics thralls blow the horn however im leaning towards the dragon being bonded instead to the owner of the horn euron with poor victarion discovering an unexpectedly fiery interpretation of the glory that moqorro sees in his future the black priest bowed his head there is no need the lord of light has shown me your worth lord captain every night in my fires i glimpse the glory that awaits you
asoiaf,not_removed,funky theory but afaik no dragon has ever switched riders while their original rider was alive i think that is an important point they stick to their masterfriendwhatever you call them and that is their rider for the remainder of the riders life
asoiaf,not_removed,no the supernatural themes with him make it seem too out of place
asoiaf,not_removed,it might not come true because like prereek theon euron has an ego
asoiaf,not_removed,i can see it now the horn fails and the dragon tries to roast vic then he wrestles the beast and thoroughly dominates it then rides it straight to euron for some bitch better have my money
asoiaf,not_removed,except for the horn right isnt that the point of a magic horn to control dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,youre right thats a bonkers theory
asoiaf,not_removed,i do think that benjen knew about jon i am not sure but i think in the books its said that benjen and lyanna were very close he might have known that she had a thing for reagar she wasnt kidnapped it was a love story you cant convince me otherwise and connect the dots
asoiaf,not_removed,he was making a joke about jon not yet understanding that he was giving up all that bad poosey nothing more
asoiaf,not_removed,im also on a rewatch and when jon and ned part ways the camera cuts to benjen for a moment made me wonder if he knows about jon heres what i mean
asoiaf,not_removed,as much as i want to agree with you i dont believe the starks were planning a targaryen revolution ned wanted protect jon because that was lyannas dying wish that would entail keeping his heritage quiet forever even if he told jon eventually if lyanna asked ned to ensure her son claimed his birthright when the time came that would be a different scenario entirely where the op would be more likely this scenario is still possible but with the way ned conducted himself with respect to jon in the books and show i doubt this would be neds end goal
asoiaf,not_removed,i doubt dd even knew about jon being a targaryen at the start im not sure whether grrm revealed the big plotlines until he had to
asoiaf,not_removed,i think this is mentioned on this sub almost weekly
asoiaf,not_removed,good catch time to binge watch the show from the beginning again
asoiaf,not_removed,born starks often joined the nights watch as they do not likely have a claim for winterfell once ned has an heir benjen knew he would most likely never be lord of winterfell although most of westeros laughs at the nw starks consider it a great honor to join and are often given important jobs like first ranger so they feel like they are actually doing something important with their lives
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i dont think ned ever explicitly told him but benjen is a brother to ned and to lyanna he knew them both very well he would know about her passion for rhaegar and that ned would never father a bastard when you know each of them that well and match up timelines its an easy game of connect the dots for benjen
asoiaf,not_removed,we also dont know why benjen took the black it could be related to lyanna and rhaegar
asoiaf,not_removed,this
asoiaf,not_removed,nice catch going back and rewatching has made me appreciate how much thought dd put into those crucial early season eps
asoiaf,not_removed,good point i dont think the line had anything to do with starting a revolution this was before all hell broke loose im sure noone was thinking revolution especially the starks just more of a youre not a bastard jon your kids actually matter type of line
asoiaf,not_removed,when grrm met with dd for the first time he agreed to make the show if dd could answer one question who are jons real parents so yeah they knew from the start
asoiaf,not_removed,im pretty sure that in the og rlj post like years ago this was the thing that tipped the person off
asoiaf,not_removed,i actually searched and saw a thread from years ago discussing ben and jons convo but not really highlighting the family part didnt know it gets posted weekly sorry bro
asoiaf,not_removed,do the books man sheesh with the show only people the actual story is soooo much better what better time than between seasons to dive into the story grrm created edit wow down votes for promoting how awesome the book series is shame shame shame ding ding
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks for that
asoiaf,not_removed,definitely not weekly but i have seen it every now and then dont know why people need to point this out every time something gets repeated not everyone knows every single post thats ever been made on this sub and its nice to see people find things on their own
asoiaf,not_removed,dude im so pissed at you right now s
asoiaf,not_removed,i get what you mean but at this point they are becoming different stories so it makes sense to read the books again to prepare for twow and binge all the seasons to get ready for season
asoiaf,not_removed,agree the stark family was very weak when benjen took the black it wasnt questioned too much because the starks have a history of sending younger sons to the wall but the timing was pretty crazy if you think about it benjen must have been ruling winterfell during roberts rebellion and the moment ned the last living member of his immediate family returns he gives up his name and leaves because his family doesnt need another stark around i dont think so
asoiaf,not_removed,randyll sided with his liege lordhe sided with the person who had the strongest army and who he thought stood a good chance winning
asoiaf,not_removed,randyll sneers at reading and his sons loves very much believing that a man needs to be violent stannis is a history nerd as shown when he s tells samwell tarly to keep reading demonstrating that he values their skills outwardly similar inwardly dissimilar
asoiaf,not_removed,why would they be bros they may well respect each others capabilities but i dont know why they would be friends i say that stannis is a danger to you lord randyll tarly declared leave him unblooded and he will only grow stronger while your own power is diminished by battle the lannisters will not be beaten in a day by the time you are done with them lord stannis may be as strong as you or stronger stannis does not seem to have many friends certainly not men of a similar rank to him we dont know as much about tarly but he seems part of the reach inner circle getting along with the likes of tyrell redwyne and rowan he also seems to have been genuinely fond of renly if that is so why is the knight of flowers not among you and where is mathis rowan randyll tarly lady oakheart why are they not here in your company they who loved renly best where is brienne of tarth i ask you
asoiaf,not_removed,the tyrells sided with renly so house tarly had to follow their liege lords
asoiaf,not_removed,like stannis in roberts rebellion he obeyed his liege lord
asoiaf,not_removed,randyll follows his liege lord like any person with a brain should never understood the morons that side with their king over their liege lordyou do realize your king is not gonna save you when your liege lord comes to kill you right
asoiaf,not_removed,because randyll tarly is one of the best commanders and thinkers left in westeros renly had the men and the support of the people its along the same lines as twyin sacking kl they chose who they thought was the winning side
asoiaf,not_removed,because randyll follows mace and he is listed by penrose as one of the people that loved renly most also stannis is a dick that nobody besides davos really likes
asoiaf,not_removed,dont think either of them have any bros lord tarly sided with his leige lord also the tyrells and renly had a massive army it would be pretty dumb for the tarlys to side with stannis when you consider their location
asoiaf,not_removed,he declared for renly because his liege lord did so tarly is nothing if not loyal hed probably be one of the few people that could potentially be friendly to stannis though theyve got a lot in common
asoiaf,not_removed,slight diversion about whether to follow your liege lord or king when the two are at odds if you follow your king over your liege lord the latter is likely to disown you if victorious if you follow your liege lord over your king youre only upholding the feudal contract and the king is unlikely to punish you if victorious after all sending the message do not follow your liege lord is pretty daft if you are a liege lord
asoiaf,not_removed,because randyll never realized who the one true king of westeros was also because of all the reasons everyone else have already mentioned number one being that renly was his liege lord
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis does not seem to have many friends certainly not men of a similar rank to him the way stannis treats his wife is so awkward thats its funny i agree stannis doesnt seem like someone who has a lot of friends even when talking about eddard stark he took special care to mention that he respected ned but that they had no love for each other if there was one person who shares the same values and is compatible with stannis it would be ned yet stannis doesnt view him as a friend barristan also has values similar to stannis but theyre not friends either if barristan liked stannis that much he would have at least considered pledging his sword to him but nope so stannis truly has no friends but i really like him though its so funny how stubborn and pedantic he is even correcting his maester when he said i dont know that we ought to call robert my beloved brother either he loved me no more than he had to nor i him a harmless courtesy your grace pylos said a lie take it out about randyll tarly im so eager to read more about him hes nearly as honest as stannis and even more blunt rude even lol
asoiaf,not_removed,that quote shed a light on randyll tarly that makes him so more complex imo as i would have thought he respected renly i would not have that that he was one who loved renly the best
asoiaf,not_removed,mace tyrell was his liege lord
asoiaf,not_removed,if there was one person who shares the same values and is compatible with stannis it would be ned yet stannis doesnt view him as a friend this is such a huge factor in stannis strained relationship with robert imo that bobby b loved ned not his rather similar brother whereas ned still loved brandon who was rather similar to robert
asoiaf,not_removed,if there was one person who shares the same values and is compatible with stannis it would be ned not really ned genuinely cares about honor and both his family and friends while being a moral person while stannis honestly doesnt care about any of those all that much similarly again selmy is man of honor while stannis isnt ned and selmy generally being serious people doesnt make them anymore like stannis then it does make them like tywin
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah sorry thats what i meant to say and that since the tyrells were in bed with renly that it is only natural randyll would support renly
asoiaf,not_removed,jon has targaryen theme playing for him in as well
asoiaf,not_removed,wait am i supposed to pick a queen of love and beauty now im sorry ubryndenbfish and all other folks i love even more but ive gotta go with usomethinglikealawyer because i was impressed with him picking aegon the conqueror as worst parent because he kicked said grrmfish out of the contest but most importantly because with ubookshelfstud nbsp ps you folks redditors
asoiaf,not_removed,i just have to say these essays were really terrific they all went to show that theres a ton you can discuss about any aspect of the series much as i may still get emotional about not having twow two or three times a day the tournament and all the participants showed that we still have plenty to talk about
asoiaf,not_removed,no dickbutt would not recommend

asoiaf,not_removed,since you get to bask in the warm afterglow of being right i enjoyed the essays but its the pretend gambling that really kept my interest i hope it is understood that i dont actually think i did anything oddly enough though i did do my homework and chose the person i thought would win you know your stuff and have a very accessible style of writing you deserved it now get out to the ceremony at the jean cocteau and pick up your trophy

asoiaf,not_removed,that was confirmed long ago

asoiaf,not_removed,always go as a panda always
asoiaf,not_removed,source httpwwwmakinggameofthronescomproductiondiarygotconnectionsnedpromisetowerofjoyinfographic
asoiaf,not_removed,they released it just after the finale
asoiaf,not_removed,just start at the beginning twow might come earlier it almost certainly wont
asoiaf,not_removed,a friend of mine started with a feast for crows and didnt have much of an issue but i would definitely recommend starting with book one game of thrones will very much feel like a retread as season one was incredibly faithful but theres much more depth to be found in the novels with the books second person perspective i was a huge fan of the show only until three months ago when i finally picked up and ive had a fantastic time catching up there are many secondary characters that arent vital to the plot and dont appear in the show but just being familiar with them by the time the books really part from the show will make it a much more enjoyable read
asoiaf,not_removed,i always recommend starting from book but you can probably skip safely to the start of book if you really want to book plot is pretty similar to the show but its such a fastpaced actiony read that its worth your time anyway books and are the most different from the show and pretty much better in almost every way imho still i would say its a good idea to read and you get a lot more insight into the characters from the getgo and theres some fairly important scenes in books and that didnt make it into the show
asoiaf,not_removed,you should start with the first book enjoy your journey
asoiaf,not_removed,start from the beginning its worth it i bet you will read the first two books quicker than youll read the third asos is packed with so much stuff that you will find yourself wanting to slow down and pause between chapter to better understand and appreciate the story also there is enough material from the first too books that was left out that makes it worth reading them anyway
asoiaf,not_removed,if youre gonna read read from agot if youre too lazy to just dont you can also buy audiobooks if you dont mind someone else giving voices to characters
asoiaf,not_removed,it took me a looooooong time to get through the first book after having watched the show because it followed so closely that being said if you skip it you will miss a lot of the thoughts people have and almost all of the rlj clues i would say start at agot if you can but skip to the second book if it is too unbearable thats where things start to shift and a lot of stuff gets changedleft out
asoiaf,not_removed,i saw the show blue ray lores and some spoilers from the wiki before start the books series a game of thrones was a little heavy because i knew most of the things there are a few chapter that definitive worth it so i would recommend read all the books but answering your question probably the epilogue of asos
asoiaf,not_removed,read it from the beginning its worth it if you really feel the need to skip a book i would skip agot because its so similar to the first season you can probably pick up a storm of swords with little issue i suggest reading it all
asoiaf,not_removed,the final novel wont be out for years and years so why would you hold off on reading it just because winds isnt out yet just read the damn books or plan on waiting years at the least for the series to be finished
asoiaf,not_removed,its crucial to read them all and come back and tell us your reactions when you do there are just too many massive changes that will make your brain explode if you try to read the later books with the assumption that they follow on seasons through little things about arya gendry jaime et al will drive you nuts if you read books while relying on for the backstories season and game of thrones are close enough but agot as per ssm has the most foreshadowing of any book and its foreshadowing a lot of stuff that never happens in the show so the best approach is read them all in order read them all in feastdance order read the or twow preview chapters the prequels and the world book read them all in pov order readlisten to all the great analysts radio westeros wars of ice and fire meereenese knot history of westeros etc etc etc etc rinse and repeat
asoiaf,not_removed,i started with book recently i recommend it i dont have as much time to read so i got the audiobooks
asoiaf,not_removed,start book one
asoiaf,not_removed,start with a game of thrones and read through the entire saga
asoiaf,not_removed,first why is this marked no spoilers when the op has watch the whole show up to this point the crucial thing to realize is that a huge element of the books is mystery mystery as in agatha christie sherlock holmes the usual suspects etc im not saying that this is the most important element of the books but martin is very meticulously and consciously using foreshadowing red herrings and deception to build and pay off his mysteries the show love it or hate it is not so big on mysteries there are no s poisoned locusts pink letters or mancewinterfell mystery and many of the interhouse conspiracies are also left out so if you try to jump into the books in midstream youll start getting intrigued by the mysteries but youll be missing all the clues and buildups and wind up pulling your hair out things you remember from the show will conflict with reveals that occur in the books this is why so many hardcore book readers get so exasperated when s some supposedly minor character gets killed off before getting into the meat of the mysteries that character is embroiled in the rampant anger over the deaths of minor characters stems from this
asoiaf,not_removed,start from the beginning dont skipthe character development alone is worth it
asoiaf,not_removed,just start from the beginning i envy your journey wish i could reexperiece my first read through again
asoiaf,not_removed,thats a helluva runon sentence there partner
asoiaf,not_removed,cmon stop being so lazy asoiaf is one of the greatest fantasy works of all time you should definitely read the entire work from the beginning especially if you have this the more got the better thought like you said that said the experience of reading such a work is completely different from watching it the books are supposed to be read from the beginning so that the story is introduced as it should and the reader can get involved in the plot gradually and be positively surprised when it is supposed to start reading book one right now
asoiaf,not_removed,start at book one yes its very similar yes youll constantly feel like ugh ive already seen this but no you are not prepared for the books and only by watching the series its a great adaptation and i could not have done it better than it was at the time but you must read the books as they are and no do not read books and in boiled leather order also
asoiaf,not_removed,im guessing twow will come after season pt but before knock on wood season pt
asoiaf,not_removed,even if they are a slow reader i think we can guarantee that they will still beat george
asoiaf,not_removed,third person limited perspective
asoiaf,not_removed,id say book is fairly different from season that one should start there at the very least
asoiaf,not_removed,and him butchering their names on occasion
asoiaf,not_removed,puhtire
asoiaf,not_removed,it has a bittersweet taste to it when you think of how their lives will unfold and eventually end
asoiaf,not_removed,this is not a no spoilers topic for when to use no spoilers i am removing this post if you repost with a different tag youll be good to go thanks

asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,i seriously have given this some thought i wasnt kidding my house foundation would have been about or ac a year or two before the dance of dragons and would have been due to a manderly sergeantatarms saving a favorite nephew of the lord manderly at the time from a troupe of bandits hiding out in the nearby hart wood id want to tie the words to that somehow sentinel pine obviously figures prominently in my mind but i cant think of anything pithy enough
asoiaf,not_removed,this would of been the last surviving member of the house who would want revenge for his family being burn alive with wildfire
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks for the feedback i tried putting myself in that world though making something unique in westeros is hard with as much detail as grrm has put into it i didnt even know about the farwynds and i think the words would work well for them too the first men bit is because the house would want to retain pride for being part of the stark line and try to marry into it as much as possible being several generations southron though they might not know different traits of that genealogy and try to breed as large as possible and im also happy someone liked the axe ideathought it would be too much of a ripoff on the iron throne or maybe too hokey for a house weapon i personally liked the idea but im usually an oddball
asoiaf,not_removed,edgeblade nothin edgier than that
asoiaf,not_removed,if he was raised to lord for saving the nephew then he must have saved him in some heroic way right maybe think out how he tricked or trapped the bandits and something will come to you and if its a good story you should write it here because im sick and very bored
asoiaf,not_removed,you would be like the manderlys then went from the reach to white harbor yet still retained a distinct southron flavor with their knighthood fervent faith in the seven and robust appetite for the reachs abundant bounty d i think its possible for a northern house emigrating south to keep their founders values and characteristics even south you could intermarry with blackwood and bracken to keep the blood of the first men flowing theres also the royce of the vale fierce warriors with first men blood house royce seems to have a surplus of valiant cadet sons like robar and waymar and the mountain clans of the vale although i doubt a noble house would lower themselves to that d i think keeping faith in the old gods would be key in maintaining your northern heritage but since there is a weirwood in your sigil that wont be a problem one thing that is crucial to northern culture is the austerity that comes from living in the harsh winter people there tend to be save for a rainy day and not indulge in luxuries a frugally spartan lifestyle but that would go well with your martial tradition and im also happy someone liked the axe ideathought it would be too much of a ripoff on the iron throne or maybe too hokey for a house weapon i personally liked the idea but im usually an oddball i like the idea because not every house can have a valyrian weapon its the exception rather than the norm even house lannister no longer has a valyrian weapon and they cant find one for sale the only way for a steel weapon to be handed down from generation to generation is to be reforged being reforged from the steel of the conquered adds a nice flavor to it it brings pride to the descendants edit just one little thing though you said your axe is doubledheaded i heard a single headed axe is more practical in battle doubleheaded is great for ceremonial purposes but hey if someone can find examples of doubleheaded axes being used in battle ill happily stand corrected i love axes in general
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe but the cleganes are landed knights just because a lannister kennel master killed a wild animal and house baelish controls some dreary piece of land no one wants or cares about for unknown reasons my house is somewhere on that level because i dont want them to be special snowflakes but still cant think of anything to tie in with the circumstance of their founding
asoiaf,not_removed,it is not simple the current equivalents do not line up there was a hierarchy of lords but there was no real hierarchy of ranks besides what the top person in charge wanted naturally you have the top lord for the region even then many had subordinates that functioned as generals from time to time the vast majority of officer class was landed knights in the british system those were the called barons barons varied widely in command authority and how much land they controlled you can climb up the ranks to viscount earl etc however the barons are functionally the officer class their individual power was a function of access to the king or powerful official immediately after below the baronlanded knight was the knight banneret normally that was a born noble trained in war but had no land they could fight under their own banner last of the official officer class was the knight he could not fight under his own banner those are the clear class of fighting men now comes the confusing partmen at arms they looked like and fought like knights but they could be knights nobles or commoners in all cases they worked directly for a baron or noble if a man at arms was good and found a good patron he could move up to knight or knight banneret or rarely baron however their station in the chain of command was up to the commander the oddest class of fighting man was the yeoman these were freemen that cultivated their own land many of the archers came from this class they were below knights on the social ladder but were certainly not fodder infantry they and experience infantry filled the category of sergeants and ncos so by enlarge command structures went like this generals were someone higher than a baron but could be an experienced baron barons occupied spots below that up to captain knights or men at arms serve in the roles of captains and lieutenants yeomenexperienced infantry serve as ncos infantry bronn would be a man at arms shitmouth would be a sergeant etc
asoiaf,not_removed,its even more confusing where every noble rank in westeros is called a lord i wont say im the greatest at real world nobility rankings youve definitely got a better understanding of that then i do but youve got your different rankings of kings and your dukes and your counts and your earls and your barons etc where in westeros it seems like literally all of those are called lords huge amount of land under your control lord paramount except almost always referred to as lord what are the men with larger holdings under them called lords the men with small holdings under those smaller lords also lords dont have any land at all but used tohonorary title yep you might just be a lord

asoiaf,not_removed,speaking of mazes and blindness on the day she had woken blind the waif took her by the hand and led her through the vaults and tunnels of the rock on which the house of black and white was built up the steep stone steps into the temple proper count the steps as you climb she had said let your fingers brush the wall there are markings there invisible to the eye plain to the touch twice she could not even find her own room in the cellar and had to sleep on the floor at the base of the steps all the nooks and alcoves made the temple treacherous even after the blind girl had learned to use her ears the way her footsteps bounced off the ceiling and echoed round the legs of the thirty tall stone gods made the walls themselves seem to move and the pool of still black water did strange things to sound as well she let their footsteps be her guide but when they made their descent she counted she knew the counts of all the steps by heart under the temple was a maze of vaults and tunnels where even men with two good eyes were often lost but the blind girl had learned every inch of it and she had her stick to help her find her way should her memory falter bran is with bloodraven in a cave system with tunnels and passages ways the caves were timeless vast silent they were home to more than three score living singers and the bones of thousands dead and extended far below the hollow hill men should not go wandering in this place leaf warned them the river you hear is swift and black and flows down and down to a sunless sea and there are passages that go even deeper bottomless pits and sudden shafts forgotten ways that lead to the very center of the earth even my people have not explored them all and we have lived here for a thousand thousand of your manyears perhaps there are passages that lead all the way to the woodwalkers in essos jon is at castle black all of castle black was connected underground by a maze of tunnels that the brothers called the wormways the iron bank is basically a bunch of underground vaults and tunnels similar to the hobw the kindly man is one of the keyholders eighteen steps brought them to the vaults where five arched passageways spread out like the fingers of a mans hand down here the steps grew narrower and steeper but the girl had run up and down them a thousand times and they held no terrors for her twentytwo more steps and they were at the subcellar the tunnels here were cramped and crooked black wormholes twisting through the heart of the great rock one passage was closed off by a heavy iron door the priest hung the lantern from a hook slipped a hand inside his robe and produced an ornate key gooseprickles rose along her arms the sanctum they were going lower still down to the third level to the secret chambers where only the priests were permitted the key clicked three times very softly as the kindly man turned it in a lock the door swung open on oiled iron hinges making not a sound — the ugly little girl a dance with dragons what is the most valuable thing to the faceless men who and where can they store these faces that also use underground vaults and a special key the hall of faces is a vault within the iron bank the kindly man and the iron bank are intertwined more closely than people think the ib is involved in the dramas of westeros then so are the fm to what end sorry this train of thought on mazes kinda went left field
asoiaf,not_removed,the prophetic nature of asoiaf dreams
asoiaf,not_removed,ive long been thinking on this as well since braavos was founded by former slaves the ib and fm are cut from the same cloth the faceless men they are servants of the many faced god the god of death for a price they will give the gift of death the iron bank they have vaults they lend money they support the powerful houses they will have their due i believe the faceless men are the collections agents of the iron bank and that the two are actually the same organization and act as a sort of shadow government of the entire realm
asoiaf,not_removed,they have very strange similar themes of descending into darkness where you know there is something horrendous you go looking for your family the further down you go also the flaming swords jon dreams this too i think this is not actually a flaming sword its valyrian steel jaime and briennes flaming swords are the two halves of ice jons is longclaw
asoiaf,not_removed,youre definitely right there is also a line in aryas chapter where she wants a flaming sword when your dragons were small they were a wonder grown they are death and devastation a flaming sword above the world said about danys dragons in the mercy chapter she wants to see a dragon the fact that her bad dream lead her down into the darkness of the red keep and she bonds with the dead dragon bones they were like old friends the fact that she had to go down serpentine stairs to get there jon also goes down spiral stairs she sat inside the skull mind of a dragon as a stark skinchanger 😮 and them watching her pass out of enemy hands
asoiaf,not_removed,any reference to max payne makes me happy love that game so much as far as comparing max to the hound i think youre absolutely right theyre both tragic characters in that they would probably be pretty decent people in the right circumstances another similarity might be that they know they arent good or honorable people but take it upon themselves to protect the people who are
asoiaf,not_removed,as you say at the end of your post i think its just a standard antihero trope books tv movies games whatever your favorite media theres no shortage of damaged cynical alcoholic antiheroes who still have some good buried underneath all of that
asoiaf,not_removed,sadly i read the synopsis before i played i dont know if the story is worth playing through now that that i know what happens as well as the gameplaygraphics being pretty outdated it may still be really fun for all i know also idk if they have a remastered version out for pc ive heard great things about it though
asoiaf,not_removed,in another world they could have been lifeloving people i think they both know that making them all the more tragic both are really interesting characters glad you have the same ideas as me
asoiaf,not_removed,i know that you are for sure right there are tons of antiheros with similar qualities to both sandor and max although i do think they are unique in their own ways they probably do follow a similar arc as many others like them i just meant to point out a similarity in the two characters that i like and have had in my headspace at the same time others probably know of these characters but havent thought of them in the same breath thats all the discussion i hope to add
asoiaf,not_removed,still fun they play almost exactly like but with way more available weapons a better story and no need for a cover system i dont think there is any remastered version available
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know what to play it on then
asoiaf,not_removed,you should definitely play them and on the pc too was fun but and are much better
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe melisandre says at some point that she heard of such things before if it is true that she is years old then she would be the one to have heard it i guess it is also said about the starks of winterfell that the swords on their graves are meant to keep them in their tombs suggesting some notion of people waking up from the dead then you have the ironborn what is dead may never die they practice it with cpr now but who knows how that originally started
asoiaf,not_removed,if we go for the books we dont know if jon is unjon we also dont know the status of benjen besides that i dont recall any such story
asoiaf,not_removed,my favorite part of the de novellas is getting to see multiple targaryens when their dynasty was at the height of its power
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah one thing i really like about the dunk egg stories is that they are short and sweet you can easily read them in one sitting but they are of the same quality as the longer form books
asoiaf,not_removed,dunk the lunk thick as a castle wall
asoiaf,not_removed,im pretty sure im in the minority here but i think the sworn sword is the best de ill not spoil it but i love how it touches on themes of duty vs honor and the fine line between traitors vs heroes both seem favorites topics for grrm
asoiaf,not_removed,it really is like the hobbit in his franchise it is a simple fun and engaging story that doesnt involve horrible things constantly happening to innocent people
asoiaf,not_removed,well like the reallife royal dynasties they are based on the targs are quite a mixed bunch you get good ones jaehaerys i daeron ii baelor breakspear aegon v bad ones maegor daemon weak ones aenys aerys i lustful jerks aegon ii aegon iv bad insane ones aerion aerys ii less harmful insane ones baelor rhaegel and like in many inbreeding families immoral females visenya rhaenyra and in dunk and egg you see a mixed group of targs at a point where house targaryen looked secure the king having seven maleline grandsons one at the citadel but it makes sense with so many potential branches
asoiaf,not_removed,read the sworn sword and the mystery knight otherwise ill clout you round the ear
asoiaf,not_removed,theyre sooo good reading it was melancholy in a way though because we know what happens to them eventually
asoiaf,not_removed,couldnt agree more dunk is like another asoiaf pov just from an earlier time and i love the glimpses into the lives of the tourney knights
asoiaf,not_removed,baelor targaryen in the hedge knightis my favourite targaryen in the whole series reasonable likeable and kind so cool way better than dany and he doesnt even have dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,i just read the entire book a few days ago and really enjoyed it it gives some great insight in the targaryen rule and also the blackfyre rebellion
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think ive ever read a dunk and egg novella and bot finished it in one sitting shits like crack to me
asoiaf,not_removed,one day hbo will make a movie or short series of this and it will be epic i really hope its the next thing they do after the show wraps up its such a great story full of compelling characters and the action in the tourney is incredible
asoiaf,not_removed,the books are great id also recommend the graphic novels its nice having the artwork to go along with a nice story
asoiaf,not_removed,i got the book for christmas and i absolutely love the story of dunkegg reading a bit before sleep turned into hours i just want more of them
asoiaf,not_removed,dunk and egg novellas are a gem i read them earlier on in the year too
asoiaf,not_removed,i really wasnt that interested but decided to give it a try when a knight of the seven kingdoms came out man i might enjoy de more than the main story
asoiaf,not_removed,finished the de novellas myself just a couple weeks ago and i loved it so so much everyone is really worried about when we actually get the twow and ados books and the end of the series and rightfully so but im honestly even more heart broken that we probably wont get more de adventures before then such great books
asoiaf,not_removed,there is an excellent audiobook version of the hedge knight as well available as part of the legends fantasy anthology one of the very few fantasy novels i could listen to without cringing edit i found while trying to remember who the narrator was potentially of use to someone
asoiaf,not_removed,shout out to the harry lloyd audiobook
asoiaf,not_removed,its a wonderful story id honestly recommend that people interested in starting asoiaf should read the dunk and egg stories first so they get a bit of the background of what leads up to a game of thrones the de stories show the end of the silver age of targ kings and the slow lead up to the end of their dynasty
asoiaf,not_removed,the de are nice quick reads you definitely get a different perspective on a lot of characters that are occasionally mentioned in the main series you also get to see some of the older characters a lot younger if youre paying attention
asoiaf,not_removed,just read the graphic novels im in the same boat what an excellent read
asoiaf,not_removed,i used to listen to the audio version of these books while i took my saint bernard on walks around a local park there was a period of time when the geese that lived there scared him but eventually hed go out of his way so theyd have to fly away from him just for fun he wasnt the brightest but he was big and eventually brave he was my fuzzy dunk he died suddenly at two years old back in september i love those books but i cant listen to them anymore thank you for reminding me of them those are memories of him i hadnt thought about in awhile
asoiaf,not_removed,i love dunk and egg its so great rereading asoiaf and seeing dunks name pop up it just makes me smile every time
asoiaf,not_removed,i love the dunk and egg stories
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah it is great one of my favorite novellas
asoiaf,not_removed,i loved these stories because they are so personal in asoiaf every story detail has been crafted to fit into world events and move along a grand tale these however are just two lovable rascals living their little for now lives i might actually be more looking forward to the next in this series than twow
asoiaf,not_removed,i got a knight of the seven kingdoms akotsk for christmas and am reading it through too its pretty awesome so far having just finished the hedge knight
asoiaf,not_removed,i just really enjoyed learning about the creation of the green apple fossoways
asoiaf,not_removed,some targaryens tried to fix the system but through chance folly or madness their vision was ultimately crushed
asoiaf,not_removed,oak and iron guard me well or else im dead and doomed to hell
asoiaf,not_removed,i was gonna make a whole separate thread about this but ill ask here first i almost done the mystery knight and i have to say i really love all three of these stories and i realized that a big part of what i love is that they are basically alternate history since magic is not heavily involved i also realized how much i really e joyed the griffin reborn chapter in adwd does anyone know of some good historyhistorical fiction books that are about knights and tourneys and taking castles im realizing more and more that this type of stuff makes up some of my favourite moments in the series jaime in the river lands deserves mention for this as well thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,and tanselle tootall such a good sad story
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly and also the other lords they were waaaaay less bitchy and more chivalrous and strongjust having the baratheon tyrelle tully lannister all in the same place fighting in tourney instead of staying behind walls and using cheap backstabing tactics
asoiaf,not_removed,targaryens when their dynasty was at the height of its power u sure
asoiaf,not_removed,l they are of the same quality as the longer form books i couldnt agree more some people mistake the somewhat lighter toneperspective and dunks naive and simplistic viewpoint as a reflection on the writing i dont think anything could be farther from the truth that grrm can play in the same sandbox while using completely different toys shows just how much of a handle he has on his world same place totally different feelwhile still feeling the same its just wonderful was that too much i feel like that was too much ill tone down the fawning sorry one more thing i enjoy the way dunk gets to see and interact with the high lords while being so far below their station that he looks at them almost as though they are a different species or something he doesnt want to talk to them look at them get too close to themeven when he belongs there like when he watches the tilts from the sro area with the small folk instead of in the stands with the other knights as well as the highborn hes more comfortable there but as t also feels like he would rather not try to talk to an relate to the highborn and those used to being around the highborn i sure would enjoy a full de book or three can we get grrm a couple clones
asoiaf,not_removed,i really enjoyed them as well much more than expected cant wait for the shewolves of winterfell i found that even though both settings asoiaf and d and e are medieval you could tell d and e was a younger kingdom
asoiaf,not_removed,stop quoting from the book or ill clout you over the ear
asoiaf,not_removed,and long as my arm har nbsp waitwrong character
asoiaf,not_removed,was my favorite of the three too maybe because it seemed like a interesting episode rather than a big moment for de
asoiaf,not_removed,its tough to pick but that was my conclusion last time i read through them its sad and sweet at the same time and really plays with that issue of duty
asoiaf,not_removed,also gives our hero more powerballs when he actually kicked aerion to the face instead of overthink it like most characters do in asoiaf its basically the perfect book to read between asoiafs books
asoiaf,not_removed,i think thats why i enjoyed the hobbit much more than lotr i find tolkiens style to be drawn out and boring in general but the hobbit really focused more on character rather than page long descriptions of rocks and trees and rocks and trees
asoiaf,not_removed,doesnt involve horrible things i think there are plenty of horrible things just look at the very beginning of tss two decayed guys hanging in one cage and it looks like one had tried to eat the other i think the difference comes in the innocent perspectives of out series title characters they arent hard and jaded they see the bad as bad the good as good and there is little in between they are learning as they go there is ugliness and violence and all of the same things from the story proper its the perspective that has changed and the stories feel different because of itand i love them edit i know i left out happening to innocent people but the comments after this one i responded to took a turn that way
asoiaf,not_removed,a lot of horrible things happen in de its an after war story and misery is everywhere its nothing like the hobbit
asoiaf,not_removed,duuuudejust how i am having some serious difficulty remembering the targs in de and you seem to even know the aegons and which one is good and bad respect
asoiaf,not_removed,how can you compare daemon to maegor
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt maekar like his greatgreatgrandson i like the way you can see patterns in history aerion is like a protoviserys and joffrey
asoiaf,not_removed,that happens to everyone eventuallyjust in different ways if it makes you feel any better they would have been dead by the time asoiaf starts anyway
asoiaf,not_removed,after egg of course
asoiaf,not_removed,we belong in the same great house brother
asoiaf,not_removed,one day hbo will make a movie or short series of this and it will be epic ftfy however grrms books are all about povs and internal dialogues any representation that neglects those is a very bad one
asoiaf,not_removed,holy shit til
asoiaf,not_removed,its also neat that each title can also be applied to another key character in each story
asoiaf,not_removed,so true
asoiaf,not_removed,roy dotrice i found one on youtube yes shame shame shame on me and it was very good dont know his name though
asoiaf,not_removed,he does a great job
asoiaf,not_removed,makewestorosgreatagain
asoiaf,not_removed,we reading the same books all three involve incredibly bitchy backhanded tactics with very very little chivalry except from dunk and fireballs kid
asoiaf,not_removed,its set a few years after the dance of the dragons blackfyre rebellion so likely not edit brain fart
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed the de stories are great and you mentioned the supposed naivety and simplicity of the stories have a lot to do with dunk being the pov character theyre still pretty bloody from an objective point of view
asoiaf,not_removed,one thing i really love about dunk is that unlike a lot of dumb characters in books dunk actually acts dumb he makes some impressively bad decisions and is oblivious to some really obvious stuff i think its why hes probably my favorite character in all the books
asoiaf,not_removed,or ill clout you over the ear you should probably beat that out of him
asoiaf,not_removed,i think youve really hit the nail on the head here when reading it for the first time i was frankly disappointed but the story has grown on me and as you said it feels like a serial episode makes you wonder what kind of adventures they had in dorne
asoiaf,not_removed,sad and sweet at the same time and really plays with that issue of duty i think you summed it up pretty well i might add that it builds on the previous story and sets up the tone of the next story without even having the same feel there is very little introduction so you get right down to business with the dynamic duo while at the same time learning a lot about how the lesser lords can interact we also get a personal perspective on the blackfyres and the motivations of their followers
asoiaf,not_removed,i find tolkiens style to be drawn out and boring in general thank you im not brave enough to say it first those books are nt even that long time either i know theyre groundbreaking and from whence all the fantasy came butyeesh
asoiaf,not_removed,do you seriously think the tone of asoiaf is the same as the dunk and egg series
asoiaf,not_removed,you know nothing jonslow
asoiaf,not_removed,you should pick up the world of ice and fire book basically a history of the known world its got all that in itand so much more
asoiaf,not_removed,well grrm writes very distinctive characters
asoiaf,not_removed,they were both targs but while maegor was an outright sadist daemon was dangerous in a different way cunning desiring to gain power through any means and both quite prepared to engage in kinslaying
asoiaf,not_removed,by height
asoiaf,not_removed,well both seemed to care about the people and not just their power dany seems to try to be the same but unfortunately she lords herself over people and wants their loveeven though by the end of asos shes taking money from people selling themselves into slavery and shes becoming more vengefulmad queen perhaps but still too early to tell egg in hedge knightmystery knight is still learning though so i put baelor above him in the line of awesomeness spoilers from world of ice and firefun facts eggaegon the unlikely was largely disliked by the lords of westeros because of his reforms that he put into place to aid the smallfolksince he learned so much as duncans squire about how people were mistreated by great lords in the process taking away some freedoms of the lords he faced rebellions thanks to his children all refusing arranged marriagesduncan the small married jenny of oldstoneswho brough the ghost of high heart to court pissing off the laughing storm for not marrying his daughteri believe aegon married one of his daughters to his son insteadjaeherys married his sister insulting the tullys and daeron remained unmarried and didnt marry olenna redwynelater the queen of thornspossibility that he was gayor at least asexual when tywin became hand he removed all of eggs reforms giving the power back to the lords because aegon dealt with so many rebellions and uprisings by the lords he wanted to bring the dragons back so he could keep controlin the process starting the tragedy at summerhall
asoiaf,not_removed,house dunk our walls are thick
asoiaf,not_removed,duncan the tall has a shield you could get your flair at any time
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the show does a pretty good job honestly but since de stories all have a central character theyd be even easier to adapt id love to see them do a britishstyle long episode season for each de book which seems like what theyre moving towards with the final seasons already
asoiaf,not_removed,it was the one on i believe it was frank muller
asoiaf,not_removed,buildanewwall
asoiaf,not_removed,anything that baelor breakspear does or says should be the template that all royalty and great lords use to decide how to conduct themselves
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know just the thought that the lord of house lannister and the lord of house baratheon meet in the field for a joust and thats it but again i am still at the beginning of the trial by seven
asoiaf,not_removed,not dance of the dragons it is set after blackfyre rebellion
asoiaf,not_removed,dunk actually acts dumb the thing is i can sooo relate i dont know how many times i thought i was just going about my business only to find out that i was the only idiot that didnt know what the hell was going on the only thing to say at that point is oh duh or dunk the lunk thick as a castle wall maybe i just love those stories because i relate to dunk so much crap
asoiaf,not_removed,but she was not too tall for me
asoiaf,not_removed,i read all of game of thrones and de and they were both page turners i started reading the books after season of the show still found the parts that the show touched interesting i couldnt get into lotr or the hobbit at all they were super slow i got through half of the fellowship of the ring and it was so drawn out it was way too slow for me
asoiaf,not_removed,did i make that claim
asoiaf,not_removed,wheres the cut off point in that book
asoiaf,not_removed,its full of spoilers for de though afaik i havent read it yet precisely for that reason hoping that we will get more de stories eventually
asoiaf,not_removed,daemon can be a bit of a contentious character for the fandom but i still consider him a monster for such deeds as blood and cheese
asoiaf,not_removed,yes egg started really well and ended his ruling career badly it was sad but very realistic at the same time
asoiaf,not_removed,house dank ftfy
asoiaf,not_removed,duncan the tall has a shield you could get your flair at any time whoa déjà vu
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly hours seems like enough time for each story would be dragging it out too long
asoiaf,not_removed,and make the wildlings pay for it
asoiaf,not_removed,aerys wanted to do that actually in his youth he made a bunch of wild promises he never fulfilled then he went mad and began burning people to death
asoiaf,not_removed,amen
asoiaf,not_removed,and baelor breakspear has been quite decent in the story so far no
asoiaf,not_removed,urgh absolutely yes edited to fix my brain fart s
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i definitely relate to it
asoiaf,not_removed,ok fine nbsp i am going to clout you in the ear so hard your head will turn around backwards and youll spend the rest of your life looking at where youve been nbsp
asoiaf,not_removed,i couldnt get into lotr or the hobbit at all i read the hobbit when i was about and lotr at about the hobbit was okay at the time and lotr was a slog when i tried to read them more recentlyi just couldnt i was so uninterested that i just had to move on and not waste my time it felt like i was doing it as an assignment instead of for enjoyment screw that i know i should be ashamed but i dont care there i said it i dont like them may lightening strike me down
asoiaf,not_removed,im not a regular of this sub and i dont know what spoilers extended means as far as spoiler warnings so i will do my best to not spoil anything to my recollection there are very little current events within the book roberts rebellion and a few years into his reign is about as current as that gets i dont recall anything else in the back there are family trees which are updated to affc so i may not remember any sprinkled details of current events in there but its possible there are
asoiaf,not_removed,not wildlings white walkers d
asoiaf,not_removed,huzzah
asoiaf,not_removed,technically both have already happened one is just a lot more recent
asoiaf,not_removed,glaring at you silently mouthing clout and ear
asoiaf,not_removed,nice
asoiaf,not_removed,oh so it also comes with the current family trees and events
asoiaf,not_removed,how about they both pay for it also happy new year
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i was referring to the blackfyre rebellion though thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,been a while since i last picked it up but i think the book covers from the first men through roberts attack on the iron islands theres a long section on all the targaryens to sit the iron throne from aegon the conqueror to mad king aerys it details valyria and the free cities as well and gives a summary of yi ti asshai is written about but its too conjectureheavy to be reliable
asoiaf,not_removed,so theres no deaths but some of the marriages make it pretty apparent to what happened to the persons previous spouse
asoiaf,not_removed,happy new year
asoiaf,not_removed,i really need to pick this book up
asoiaf,not_removed,a happier new year then the kingslayers get foul in birth and foul in deed did have
asoiaf,not_removed,i had the same reaction when i saw a vid of grrm talking about the bookstill didnt get it though
asoiaf,not_removed,jahaerys the old conciliator
asoiaf,not_removed,mine is aegon v most of aegons troubles resulted from his efforts to improve the lives of the smallfolk whom he had interacted with while squiring for duncan although the smallfolk loved aegon for his reforms and granting of rights and protections high lords felt their powers over peasantry was diminished and curtailed by these new reforms lacking the dragons controlled by early targaryen kings aegon reluctantly compromised with the recalcitrant lords on several issues he did all he can aegon v became convinced that only with dragons could he force the lords of the seven kingdoms to accept his decrees that granted freedoms rights and protections to the smallfolk this eventually led to the tragedy of summerhall in ac in which aegon perished while trying to hatch dragon eggs lords of westeros about aegon v a bloodyhanded tyrant intent on depriving us of our godsgiven rights and liberties
asoiaf,not_removed,aegon v
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think any of the characters are actually the second come of the legendary heroes mentioned but those stories are supposed to give us clues to what their stories will be there are some pretty close parallels though jon snow tptwp promise me ned dany azor ahai closely associated with fire and all that bran last hero story really closely parallels the last hero story drogon the stallion that mounts the world lightbringer im not sure about there are several swords that are a lot like lightbringer or even directly called lightbringer but i think this is misdirection itll be interesting to to see all the connections once the series is complete im sure even if the books arent finished the show will make a lot of the connections clear
asoiaf,not_removed,aa jon snow mel has already been told afaic i think the salt is in fact snow northmenstarklyanna yet whomever had the original vision had either not seen snow or was more familiar with salt and therefore jumped to a conclusion smoke is valyriatargfirerhaegar rhaegar likely originally assumed he needed to knock up a salty dornish woman in ellia yet after a revelation or perhaps diving into more ancient text realizes he is after snow not salt and chases a northern bird if aa tptwp then it appears he is born of the line of aerys ii and rhaella song of ice and fire born of snow and smoke the other not possibly arya there is a bit of a play on words with nissa nissa and assassin nissassa nissa nissa as for lightbringer i have no clue could be anything
asoiaf,not_removed,azor ahai is dany nissa nissa was drogo the sword is danys dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,azor ahai was a human that was aided by the gods aa means gods favored helper lightbringer is venus do the research on lucifer and venus its amazing nissa nissa is hebrew for sacrifice its all an old story wrapped in star mythology that does have some basis in real fact but that has all been lost just what part of it is real and what part is the mythology must wait till the end of the series
asoiaf,not_removed,aa jon duh nissa nissa dany once they fall in love and he breaks longclaw in a battle with the others lightbrigner reforged longclaw tempered by stabbing dany through her heart of fire
asoiaf,not_removed,this is a part of the fairly comprehensive harrenhal conspiracy theory
asoiaf,not_removed,ethan glover was brandons squire and a stark bannerman so he was obligated to follow his orders the others in brandons party chose to go with him and as you say were members of more powerful houses not sworn to the starks so they had autonomy so it might have been a rare act of mercy from aerys or the highborn prisoners were killed first and ethan was left to rot in a dungeon and forgotten about once aerys mania subsided ethan could have been freed after the city was taken
asoiaf,not_removed,same reason that keyser soze let one guy live when he shot everyone in the usual suspects to spread fear
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess aerys liked the lethal weapon movies where danny glover plays murtagh and thought it was his relative
asoiaf,not_removed,he wanted someone alive to tell the tale of what happened
asoiaf,not_removed,well technically speaking if you really wanted to get into it then aerys also spared brandon stark too the pyromancers roasted lord rickard slowly banking and fanning that fire carefully to get a nice even heat his cloak caught first and then his surcoat and soon he wore nothing but metal and ashes next he would start to cook aerys promised unless his son could free him brandon tried but the more he struggled the tighter the cord constricted around his throat in the end he strangled himself brandon never would have died if he hadnt tried to save rickard he was in a device that didnt do anything so long as he didnt move it was his own struggling trying to reach the sword placed at his feet that killed him had he never gone for the sword hed never have choked so ive always kinda imagined that ethan mightve been put in a similar situation and simply didnt choke himself or finish whatever torture device aerys had put him in cause brandon and rickard are the only two people out of the over men that were executed that we hear about and their trial actually was surviveable they or at least brandon werent going to die that day no reason to think that everybody else was put in impossible situations where they had no hope of survival when we know one group at least did so its not exactly like there needs to be some great big conspiracy for why ethan survived brandon couldve too i mean there could also be a specific reason why ethan alone survived but it could also be as simple as he didnt strangle himself like brandon did
asoiaf,not_removed,you have to leave someone alive to tell the story
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah theres a very sound theory for this in there well worth the read
asoiaf,not_removed,i truly doubt aerys would have the presence of kind to spare the squire of a traitor
asoiaf,not_removed,this was along the lines of what i was thinking that he was spared since he was a possibly young squire but i also agree with the other comment that is seems out of character for aerys to specifically spare one person from the party and not just order them all executed
asoiaf,not_removed,gosh i love this reference
asoiaf,not_removed,and maybe aerys realized that he was too old for this shit
asoiaf,not_removed,this ill link the last part since it has the links to the other parts basically northriverlands were planning a rebellion and glover clued the mad king in on it
asoiaf,not_removed,aerys was persuaded by barristan to spare dontos couldve been a similar situation
asoiaf,not_removed,ethan glover was a snitch
asoiaf,not_removed,i have to agree ethan was the rat
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree in accordance with the harrenhal conspiracy ethan persuaded mad aerys to spare ethan because ethan was the rat tm
asoiaf,not_removed,the fact he had to be argued out of killing a baby reinforces the point that hed not spare a squire especially because he only spared dontos because aerys still owed barristan a favor
asoiaf,not_removed,the king owes no favors to a man doing his job
asoiaf,not_removed,the text made very clear he granted barristan a boon favor for his exemplary service which most people wouldnt be capable of so yes in fact the king does grant favors when the duty involved is well outside of what anyone could be expected to be capable of
asoiaf,not_removed,be that as it may my father sat where i sit now when lord eddard came to sisterton our maester urged us to send starks head to aerys to prove our loyalty it would have meant a rich reward the mad king was openhanded with them as pleased him by then we knew that jon arryn had taken gulltown though robert was the first man to gain the wall and slew marq grafton with his own hand this baratheon is fearless i said he fights the way a king should fight our maester chuckled at me and told us that prince rhaegar was certain to defeat this rebel that was when stark said in this world only winter is certain we may lose our heads its true but what if we prevail my father sent him on his way with his head still on his shoulders if you lose he told lord eddard you were never here
asoiaf,not_removed,i didnt catch that or simply dont remember interesting
asoiaf,not_removed,you can find more videos about asoiaf lore in this post
asoiaf,not_removed,first he was a low ranking member of the nw who wasnt expected to be elected lord commander eventually he was he is the son of ned stark he was being groomed for leadership the moment he arrived osric stark was ten when he was chosen but he served for sixty years thats four my lord youre not even close to being the youngest ever chosen youre fifth youngest so far the younger four all being sons brothers or bastards of the king in the north jon is not even the youngest stark bastard who became lord commander
asoiaf,not_removed,your comparing jon snow to a iconoclastic murdering psychopath who orchestrated the deaths of thousands of his countryman and fomented civil war in other countries i dont think that is an apt description of jon
asoiaf,not_removed,yay one more reason for me to hate him
asoiaf,not_removed,wasnt expected at the time being there a lot of other noble candidates of course he was groomed since he first set foot in castle black but not expected at the time when he actually got elected
asoiaf,not_removed,though i do not agree with your depiction of che guevara which notes little knowledge or understanding of latin america in the and i clearly stated that their similarities are few being physically similar and revolutionaries
asoiaf,not_removed,peddle pro communist propaganda elsewhere this is a fantasy book sub i dont want books to make me think i dont believe that grrm shares your approach to his works after all asoiaf is loosely based on actual historical events and lends itself to multiple readings with respect to different political systems questions of state natural rights war revolution feminism etc
asoiaf,not_removed,i value historical figures that left the world a little better than they found it ghandi mlk thomas jefferson those types of conflicted and complicated people that placed an almost unreachable ideal above their own aggrandizement and put their own necks in the noose in order to free and protect others like jon snow jon upended the status quo and sacrificed his honor for the greater good of the realm not to gain political power but to save thousands of people from starvation and slavery jon is complicated conflicted and pragmatic but he is not an ideological man and he is following ned starks path of choosing the right thing even at grave danger to himself and his order and he paid a price for that essentially sacrificing himself for a greater good jon more closely reflects a jesus type savior an arthurian hero che had dark hair that is about where the similarities end between the two i and most people didnt come to this sub to be lectured about the very good things that ernesto guevara did for the world nor to have a political reeducation of the positive points of the enslavement of the cuban people i am pretty sure that a jon snow type character would not be on board with political assassinations appropriation of private property by the state nor the institution of a slave state either you fundamentally misunderstand the character that grrm is creating or you have an agenda i chose to not assume you were confused and instead looked at the mundane comparisons you made in your post the same deconstructions made ad nauseum on this sub and saw the attempt to associate a fantasy book character with a tin pot dictators catch dog a man that caused the suffering of thousands and murdered people in cold blood and came to the conclusion you were peddling an agenda grrms political leanings have nothing to do with glorifying a murdering psychopath nor do mine
asoiaf,not_removed,then again we do not agree on che guevaras legacy which i do not believe is the place to discuss it i would only point out that jon did kill a lot of people for instance janos slynt for insubordination again it seems you do not want to understand that my comparison between the two does not go much further than their physical resembles if that is so hard for you to accept dont read this post and leave me alone
asoiaf,not_removed,youre likening all the people guevara killed personally and who died at his express orders to jon killing slynt for complete insubordination and in the show his wouldbe mutineersmurderers beyond that jon kills qhorin halfhand on the halfhands orders and a number of wildlings who are assaulting the wall you have absolutely nothing to base a comparison between the two of them on plenty of us here are sensible leftists just like grrm but no one is going to sit here and let you compare a clearly messianic figure in a series that devotes so much of itself to detailing the ugliness of war to a murderer like ernesto guevara
asoiaf,not_removed,my comparison between the two killing people is only to make a point on how people who are in command sometimes have to make choices they are not completely comfortable with and again im not saying they are the same is that so difficult to understand
asoiaf,not_removed,viserion is white for jon the white wolf rhaegal is green with some gold if im not mistaken for bran a greenseer and tyrion a lannister
asoiaf,not_removed,most of the descriptions of viserion ive found say he has cream scales with streaks of gold and that his horns wing bones and spinal crest are all gold so with all the gold id think tyrion would be a likely choice for him then jon can have rhaegal the living memory of his father
asoiaf,not_removed,i like the idea of jon having rhaegal because hes named after jons dad and also his coloring seems to fit jon better his green scales reminds me of the children of the forest and the bronze scales are reminiscent of the first men which house stark descends from rhaegal also has black claws and teeth which remind me of jons time with the nights watch
asoiaf,not_removed,im not sure we could just divide them between targaryens like that because we dont know whatll happen to those people or to those dragons someall of those dragons might die dany andor jon might day especially in a case where dany dies and drogon doesnt for all you know jon will be the next rider for drogon or maybe jon will never ride a dragon because he has other things to do or all the dragons are taken by others or jonaryabran will warg all the dragons too many options
asoiaf,not_removed,but isnt dragon riding a targaryenonly activity
asoiaf,not_removed,this in season one tyrion made bran a saddle so he could ride a horse bran will be the metaphorical saddle that allows tyrion to ride a dragon through his warging abilities
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion might be a targaryen dragonriding might be restricted to the blood of old valyria but we have no clue about dragonwarging
asoiaf,not_removed,possibly but i dont buy ajt i wont deny that the evidence is there if you want to believe but its just not my cup of tea not positive you must be a targaryen or valyrian to dragonride and youre right warning is something completely different thats why i think tyrion and bran will work together with the third dragon also even if aegon is not legit he can still ride the dragon because many believe he is a blackfyre technically still of targaryen blood
asoiaf,not_removed,we know dragonriding requires the blood of valyria because only the dragonseed were able to ride dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,it literally takes not even minutes to write a blog post it means nothing imo
asoiaf,not_removed,so what this doesnt mean shit sometimes he doesnt post anything in two weeks him posting on his blog has nothing to do with his writing progress honestly there was a time when i checked his blog almost on a daily basis but now i dont know the fires almost gone id love to get my hands on twow obviously but the fact that there are no news at all in almost august even though after his new years eve post is just absolutely crushing
asoiaf,not_removed,one post about ants remember that most folks miss
asoiaf,not_removed,this account is going into hibernation until spring arrivederci
asoiaf,not_removed,one day hes gonna post hahahaha bitches i aint got shit aint got shit motherbitches aint got shit before aint got shit now aint got shit tomorrow aint never gonna have shit but shit hahaha bitches yall motherbitches stay up imma get up outta here and i will say i told you so
asoiaf,not_removed,ants are amazing
asoiaf,not_removed,how many people that complain about how long it takes for him to write are writers themselves how long do you think it takes to write one page how long do you think it takes to write pages its not an easy task especially the stuff hes writing have patience and enjoy the life you lead outside of a fictional world created by grrm
asoiaf,not_removed,anyone else tired about anything about the goddamn hugos
asoiaf,not_removed,he does everything he can to avoid writing the books the guy has had writers block for a long time now sad but true fingers crossed hbo do him justice in completing his story as i am convinced that he never will i think he gets more enjoyment out of doing his other work these days
asoiaf,not_removed,it always annoys me when someone only points out the negative what about the two weeks a month ago when he hadnt posted anything at all why didnt you mention that at the time between june and july he hasnt posted a single blog entry thats gotta be positive nah
asoiaf,not_removed,id be more surprised if he was writing the books
asoiaf,not_removed,george r r martin is not your bitch
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe grrm had been quiet on blog for a while before previous books release was announced
asoiaf,not_removed,twow has actually been finished four years grrm is just a master of suspense
asoiaf,not_removed,on a relative note
asoiaf,not_removed,its probably fine maybe he was on a tea break or something like let me reward myself with one blog post for every major plot point i resolve i honestly prefer that he takes the time he needs so that the product we get would do the series and our expectations justice
asoiaf,not_removed,and this bothers you because hes not spending every second writing the next novel heres a tiny bit of advice from an old person stop wasting your time worrying about things you cant control stop wasting time wrestling with the path people who will never care what you think are taking focus on what you can change otherwise think about something else
asoiaf,not_removed,ha
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm no announcement to make still revising that theon chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,ive lost nearly all interest in the story at this point i pop my head in here every now and then just to see if grrm finally made some sort of progress report but alas i wish i could have a career where i could sit in an office for six years and produce no work output but continue picking up a paycheck mmmbring on the downvotes of grrms loyal followers who cant face that they will likely never see twow let alone ados
asoiaf,not_removed,this is grrm were talking about it probably took him a week to write each one
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly there was a time when i checked his blog almost on a daily basis but now i dont know the fires almost gone id love to get my hands on twow obviously but the fact that there are no news at all in almost august even though after his new years eve post is just absolutely crushing my fucking christ that was almost a year ago yeah ive just stopped caring about the series at this point honestly how does he spend so much time making so little progress
asoiaf,not_removed,he wont even finish the next two books he will just let the show finish the story for him hes to old to finish them at this rate dd will just butcher the remainder of the story like they have done with the show
asoiaf,not_removed,if he doesnt finish by years end i looking forward to the new years post it will probably be better than the book is existing in fact better than nonexistence
asoiaf,not_removed,i cant believe its been months since the new years post stakeout it seems like yesterday whats funny is that there were people at that time who were convinced that hed be done in a month or two
asoiaf,not_removed,im a writer sometimes it takes me months to write one short story or years for novels one page tho cmon once a writer has the creative juices flowing it is as unstoppable as a river stephen king said that starting was the hardest part i wholeheartedly agree grrm is beyond the starting point obviously years for a fantasy novel is a long time by anyones standards and as for the comment of enjoy your own life i feel you are unjustly labeling us fans as losers i have a wonderful life yet i look forward to this novel as i do with a new movie its not my life but its a fun and important aspect of it
asoiaf,not_removed,i aint a mechanic but id still whine if i took my car to the garage in and the bloke had made zero progress by
asoiaf,not_removed,how long do you think it takes to write one page considering he flat out admits to not working most of the time i dont think its relevant if he worked straight for even days a week id accept that excuse
asoiaf,not_removed,i know where youre coming from but i feel like for most people its more that he believes he can finish it in a couple months or by next year but when the time comes the book is still not done and everyone is disappointed
asoiaf,not_removed,im pretty sure every normal person was tired of hearing about it long ago george seems to see it as some sort of pivotal victory in his life
asoiaf,not_removed,i remember the time i used to think j k rowling wrote too slow so young and naive
asoiaf,not_removed,i absolutely despise comments like these were all upset that hes taking so long to write the books but that doesnt mean we should start lying and pretending that we know what his situation is really like what evidence do you have that he has writers block what evidence do you have that hes lost interest suggesting he gets more enjoyment out of other work is just ludicrous a completely unsubstantiated claim im fine with people being pessimistic but just dont make up stuff and proclaim it as truth
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think he has writers block i think hes a perfectionist and is busy with other stuff the process of writer is also something he doesnt enjoy according to him
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe he has writers block thats very possible given his writing speed past asos but i see no indication that he has given up on twow and ados the progress is just much slower than he hoped my impression is that he has trouble getting all these different plotlines back together for example he wrote three versions of drogons return to meereen before choosing the one he ended up publishing i guess now hes trying to put the storylines back together he encounters such situations more frequently leading to such greatly reduced pace writing a blog post takes how long minutes dont try to read anything into it
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think he has writers block i think he is at the point where he has too many cooks in too many places and cant find a way to bring them all into one large resturant in two mergers i dont think young griff should have been introduced as a personal note
asoiaf,not_removed,its not writers block its because he has made a big deal about how his series is different from lotr how it isnt good vs evil but as the series gets into its act it becomes very obvious its a humans vs evil ice demons story that must be depressing for him
asoiaf,not_removed,i think we can safely say grrm spends more time writing asoiaf than pretty much anyone here on rasoiaf spends doing anything you dont know him you dont know how hard he works you have no way of knowing so stop forming judgements
asoiaf,not_removed,this sub is garbage whenever it comes to this topic hes doing everything he can to avoid writing what how the hell would you know that
asoiaf,not_removed,wow really have him nailed down eh you have no idea no clue at all how about you doing something in your life as hard as he has and then we can you a dragging ass can you imagine waiting since the first book that is patience i want to read the wild card series so i may check that out this once i finish the first books in expanse series
asoiaf,not_removed,he doesnt have writers block as far as i can tell neither of us are privy to twow so we have no idea how it is progressing he has always said he can only write one word at a time page by page he has never claimed to be fast with his process i mean i even remember hearing him state that he can only write in his home at his desk considering all the touring he had do to for got it is a wonder if he was getting anything completed during that time in the end we will get it when it is done this nonsense about people complaining every time he makes a post and disregarding the long periods he does not and complaining that he doesnt spend every waking moment typing twow at his desk is pathetic imo if the guy didnt have a life and was just chained to his desk typing like so many people seem to want do you honestly think we would get a decent book of any kind
asoiaf,not_removed,to be honest i looked at this as a positive rather than a negative him spending more time interacting means hes probably more lax which could mean hes getting closer to the finish line
asoiaf,not_removed,because when he doesnt post anything these same people go crazy because if he was making progress he would obviously post about it a lot if vocal grrm fans are crazy
asoiaf,not_removed,this is positive when the nfl season starts and he goes back to bitching about being a fan of two of the shittier franchises that is when the real negativity wins
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps not but i can still critique his poor work ethic
asoiaf,not_removed,i hate this type of comment nobody is saying grrm owes them anything that doesnt mean we as fans cant be unhappy with the time he takes to write his books
asoiaf,not_removed,that doesnt mean he isnt a bitch
asoiaf,not_removed,he likes the show he had nothing but praise for it when it was nominated for several emmys god i wish this rumor would die
asoiaf,not_removed,this is insane in the last seasons grrm himself confirmed the hodor backstory and stannis burning his daughter as accurate
asoiaf,not_removed,his writers block will persist until the show is about to wrap up whatever absurd endgame they write for themselves based on his rough outline and then hell release his last few novels at a good pace and well get the real story evil i like it i hope you are right i dont have faith though
asoiaf,not_removed,well if you write a successful book or patent a clever invention then you can best of luck
asoiaf,not_removed,i get youre disappointed about the lack of twow but youre over exaggerating his unproductivity by saying he is being paid for doing nothing if you really believe that you dont know what youre talking about
asoiaf,not_removed,he does produce outputs wild cards no one cares about that though including me generates paychecks a knight of the seven kingdoms generates paychecks a world of ice and fire generates paychecks lands of ice and fire generates paychecks wit and wisdom of tyrion lannister generates paychecks various treatments scripts and consulting for hbo generates paychecks
asoiaf,not_removed,i bet he double checks each post to make sure that game of thrones and other titles are properly capitalized to keep that fresh geocities website feeling
asoiaf,not_removed,one week to write the post another week after the web browser ate it
asoiaf,not_removed,the answer is that he is semiretired and barely works on the book at this point this is from his new year post i worked on the book a couple of days ago revising a theon chapter and adding some new material and i will writing on it again tomorrow this is him saying hes making process hes proud that he worked on the book a couple of days ago and plans to work on it again tomorrow why doesnt he just plan to write every day most productive writers eg stephen king haruki murakami in this article have a daily schedule they sit down at their desk at exactly the same time every day and work for a certain period maybe its only four hours maybe its six but they have a work ethic obviously grrm does not he stresses about not making any progress and does not in fact actually make progress obviously im not saying he needs to be chained to his desk until he finishes his novel but if hes still pretending to be a professional writer he should at least meet his readers halfway and show up to work every day
asoiaf,not_removed,i hate to read comments like this because i feel like this will be me in a year i hope that in a year i am writing some smart ass post about how i told all of you that he would finish twow and that it would be the best book but im starting to doubt my convictions
asoiaf,not_removed,we can say that grrm is lazy or his will to write the books is dwindlingdead but age has little to do with it stephen king is older than him and has released books in the time since adwd came out including a whole trilogy
asoiaf,not_removed,hbos doing pretty freaking well no it doesnt make a lot of sense sometimes but its beautifully produced makes more sense than an unfinished series so we shouldnt complain about the show plus most of the actors have been stellar as well
asoiaf,not_removed,this account is going into hibernation until spring arrivederci
asoiaf,not_removed,the sample chapters exist and represent winds at the moment if we were to compare
asoiaf,not_removed,this account is going into hibernation until spring arrivederci
asoiaf,not_removed,i think dance came out years ago not
asoiaf,not_removed,sometimes a page can be written in minutes but other times a single sentence can take over an hour sometimes things flow well and you can work uninterrupted for hours and sometimes all it takes is a small distraction to derail and take you completely out of that space writing takes time it can be a struggle and im sure grrm more than any fan wishes he could get these books out faster to pull random ideas out of the air for the sole purpose of putting down grrm and spreading dissatisfaction is a poor way of spending your time im not calling anybody a loser but to go online saying all the things i see repeated on here about why he hasnt finished the books and why he never will is just negativity for the sake of negativity and theres no reason for that because it only breeds outrage and misery
asoiaf,not_removed,thats a pretty shit analogy tbh tho youd expect a car to be fixed in a day maybe a few days maybe a week youre not expecting a book in that same amount of time are you because theres no approximate amount of time a book will take to finish and also he has almost certainly made progress so your analogy is flawed again itd be more like the car being half done years later if you had to stick with the car analogy
asoiaf,not_removed,i get that and its not wrong to be disappointed but seeing threads like this pop up every other day screams of unhealthy obsession all of us including grrm have fallen into this trap laid by the internet and social media where we demand immediate gratification and we become enraged when we dont get the thing we want when we want it we demand updates so every now and then grrm will give us something based on what he thinks and how he feels about his progress and we take that to be the word of god then he doesnt deliver god has betrayed us so we curse him and spew hate about him because we had unreal expectations based on his own unreal expectations my point is that we all need to take a step back relax live our lives let the man work and itll come when it comes i love asoiaf too but there is an infinite number of things you could be doing with your time while you wait for the next book rather than getting mad on an internet forum which will just make the wait more interminable you make yourself miserable by doing this
asoiaf,not_removed,would you say you were a
asoiaf,not_removed,me too i was also looking foward to the cursed child so young and naive
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed pessimism is well earned at this point but assuming his circumstances without evidence accomplishes nothing i dont think hell finish the series perfectly fine statement hes getting old and hes taking half a decade to write each book its an understandable viewpoint he has writers block understandable again but only a possibility its not objective fact like hes taking a long time but its possible how likely it is is up for debate hes lost interest in the series next to no evidence perfectly possible again but taking a long time doesnt mean hes not trying he took a long time for feast and dance and they both released in the end saying hes lost interest in what hes called his magnum opus without anything to back it up is depressing for the sake of it i realise im preaching to the choir here since i completely agree with everything you said but i thought id just elaborate a bit on your points
asoiaf,not_removed,just google meereenese knot
asoiaf,not_removed,id also imagine how time consuming it must be to have to check everything newly written lines up with everything thats already been written down to the most minor of characters
asoiaf,not_removed,i doubt he still has writers block at this point theres no way he hasnt figured out how to bring all the plot lines together by now in fact and excuse me if i sound like an idiot i get the impression from his blog that hes been more carefree lately like a giant load has been lifted off of his shoulders i think hes almost done with the book now and will announce it within a month or so wait and see
asoiaf,not_removed,three version of drogons return to meereen i would love to see all three those versions are not wasted time or inefficiency they are hints of the various routes grrm considered for the series what grrm selects for publication is only one route then we call the published material canon that doesnt mean the other versions were wrong many just werent selected by grrm for this publication an old saying the secret of good writing is rewriting
asoiaf,not_removed,dude come on that doesnt even make sense dont be ridiculous
asoiaf,not_removed,have you read some of the recent euron theories regarding the forsaken twow chapter they give me a lot of hope for the future of the series even if it is shaping up to be a good vs evil situation it doesnt seem like things will be conventional
asoiaf,not_removed,see you just used the same poor logic to defend him as you did to excoriate the rest of us if it looks like a duck quacks like a duck floats like a duck let me save you the suspense its a fucking duck
asoiaf,not_removed,i think we can safely say grrm spends more time writing asoiaf than pretty much anyone here on rasoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,its been years since adwd pretty sure we all do our jobs a lot more than grrm does his
asoiaf,not_removed,you dont know him you dont know how hard he works you have no way of knowing so stop forming judgements actually we do hes stated before that he cannot write while traveling he flat out refuses to work from anywhere but his home computer which must have a particular dos word editor on it so we know how much time he spends going to cons visiting his publisher vacationing etc he blogs about it you know so we can set an upper maximum on the numbers of days that he by his words could actually be writing he also says that he has to be distraction free for several days before he can get into the productive writing zone so if hes working on something for his theatre or watching football or blogging or discussing the hugos hes probably not in that zone if you actually pay attention to the conditions hes outlined are necessary for him to write productively you can pretty much see that he probably only writes about half the year
asoiaf,not_removed,by having eyes and a brain
asoiaf,not_removed,um no since the first book wasnt a matter of patience he wrote the first three and arguably the best in a matter of years where i came in before asos i felt relatively fortunate and very content with the publish dates and noticeably increased pacing thats back when the series was legitimately exciting if you mean since asos id guess his greatest efforts regarding asoiaf would be dragging his ass to the emmys stage last year when dds adaptation swept the awards and he had to go up to the stage that sort of cardio must have been good for his overall health though so im not knocking it yes i write this tongueincheek thread is so salty dang
asoiaf,not_removed,stranger is neighing at his door
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah its all a question of interpretation i guess which is why i wouldnt guesstimate twows progress based on the frequency of grrms blog entries
asoiaf,not_removed,i hate this type of comment its basically saying grrm owes us something we as fans cant be unhappy with how he chooses to spend his time and how he writes his wonderful books hes not building a house for us from a blueprint on a deadline or painting a portrait on commission hes not an artisan hes an artist hes staring at a blank fucking page okay archaic computer screen every day
asoiaf,not_removed,ive said it before and i will say it again grrm is not our bitch but that doesnt mean he isnt a bitch
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,yes thats true i dont see how those rough plot points being accurate precludes the interpretation i offered above though it does constrain its scope
asoiaf,not_removed,haha i like it too but it is a long shot would be grrms greatest plot twist ever if he did it
asoiaf,not_removed,do you have some hidden knowledge of a major work grrm produced in the last six years
asoiaf,not_removed,this is actually a publishing world thing i used to work for an agent and every publisher editor agent and writer uses caps to talk about books i cracked up when i saw a work friend use it to talk about gilgamesh
asoiaf,not_removed,he could have a lax writing schedule if he hadnt expanded his universe after storm of swords into dorne and the iron islands but he chose to keep expanding the books to the point where he can no longer finish the story he has no one to blame but himself
asoiaf,not_removed,proud i feel youre completely taking that quote out of context that blog post was a depressing admission of failure to his fans i think that was him being unusually open and letting us know that he was writing twow at the moment
asoiaf,not_removed,in my experience since first reading the series it comes and goes sometimes i dont care at all sometimes i care deeply and am cynical sometimes i care deeply and am optimistic
asoiaf,not_removed,thats poetic we can finally have our castle in the sky with a summer that lasts a years
asoiaf,not_removed,damnit
asoiaf,not_removed,thats incredible
asoiaf,not_removed,a sweet one at that
asoiaf,not_removed,thats not grrms twitter account
asoiaf,not_removed,dumb question how would it be the anniversary of the battle of hogwarts when the last book came out in
asoiaf,not_removed,that wasnt the same thing as writers block writers block is not knowing what happens next the meereenese knot was about how things happened and the timing involved with it
asoiaf,not_removed,thats the editors job he doesnt do that for every character thats why some inconsistencies were corrected in the newer editions hell he doesnt even do that for every main character
asoiaf,not_removed,if he doesnt im coming for you
asoiaf,not_removed,i think hes almost done with the book now and will announce it within a month or so wait and see nope not falling for this one i did that so many times with adwd so fool me once shame on grrm fool me twice im a fing retard
asoiaf,not_removed,how does it not make sense that has been the conflict in the background of the whole series they raise armies of the fucking dead and they hate everything with warm blood its clearly headed for a grand conflict and we dont know anything about their culture or whqtever so they cant be anything other than an evil foreign entity
asoiaf,not_removed,it makes perfect sense he constantly speaks negatively about lotr being to simple but his story is turning out the same way
asoiaf,not_removed,youre fixating on the wrong part of my comment and missing the point
asoiaf,not_removed,i meant to say that without knowing the circumstances of his life we have no right to pass off idiotic and uninformed statements about him as fact and assuming he works harder on asoiaf than pretty much everyone else here is reasonable just look at the gargantuan amount of work hes produced and its quality do you think he does it in his free time or something
asoiaf,not_removed,i read that he wrote million words for adwd but only ended up using about thousand maybe hes just a perfectionist hes said so himself but you cant deny he works hard
asoiaf,not_removed,he doesnt have a job grrm doesnt work for you or me or anyone and if he never writes another word for asoiaf and spends the rest of his life on a beach sipping daiquiris and ogling babes thats completely his right
asoiaf,not_removed,he does owe us something weve invested hours upon hours and helped spread his story by word of mouth we pay for his stories and when we start a story its expect for it to be finished
asoiaf,not_removed,we as fans cant be unhappy with how he chooses to spend his time and how he writes his wonderful books actually we can if not being able to finish the asoiaf series makes people unhappy then everybody is perfectly within their right to be upset at grrm obviously attacking or insulting him is a different matter but just expressing your frustration is perfectly fine and reasonable
asoiaf,not_removed,he does owe us something but it is not compulsory that he delivers
asoiaf,not_removed,and that does not mean i think he is a bitch i actually dont feel anything negative towards him but i understand why people would be upset and it seems reasonably justified to some extent
asoiaf,not_removed,you just dislike the show you are free to do so but dont be ridiculous
asoiaf,not_removed,a world of ice and fire four episodes of got rogue prince princess and the queen not to mention whatever deasoiaf stuff we have not been informed of
asoiaf,not_removed,hey gilgamesh is a timeless classic
asoiaf,not_removed,im sorry but you must not have sat through that day bullshit process on new years and into the next day if you think george was in any way posting a depressing admission of failure he was not he was trolling like he always does its what he does with links to all the threads all those sad posts about believing in george or something equally pathetic note the last post is called the long night because they were still wading through georges shitposts of earlier that day where he had listed his moods as happy and pleased or whatever refreshing his troll blog hoping for an announcement it was in that sad thread long night where people finally read his latenight jan shitpost no twow cucks — the only one he labeled feelingsdepressed with a crying lj alien heres georges fuckery read those and tell me george wasnt trolling or that he was in any way depressed spoiler he wasnt ill give george points for trolling his way to infamy but depressed nope
asoiaf,not_removed,please do not insult other posters on rasoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,this account is going into hibernation until spring arrivederci
asoiaf,not_removed,thats not grrms real twitter account
asoiaf,not_removed,because the books were set in the past
asoiaf,not_removed,id still argue its a form of writers block
asoiaf,not_removed,no he will i know he will he wouldnt let me down not now not ever
asoiaf,not_removed,repost of earlier comment im pretty confident twow will be announced before the end of summer grrm must be putting the finishing touches to it right about now i mean he thought he could possibly get it done in months all the way back in september so how far away could it really be
asoiaf,not_removed,and we dont know anything about their culture or whqtever so they cant be anything other than an evil foreign entity grrm continuously repeats that his books arent about good vs evil and we dont actually know anything about the white walkers or their culture so its only correct to assume that martin is a liar and a hypocrite that the white walkers are an evil foreign entity and that the story will eventually boil down to human vs evil ice demon
asoiaf,not_removed,he constantly speaks negatively about lotr you are in cloud cuckoo land lotr is his favourite novel of all time he rarely goes minues in an interview without praising tolkien
asoiaf,not_removed,why would he speak out about it so often if he planned to do the exact same thing with the others genius there is obviously more to these ice demons than meets the eye
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,lets just compare him to a standard to person granted right from the start this might be flawed since he is a thinker worker vs someone who is a hands worker since he can have a great idea on the shitter and that might count as work but as inelegant as this may be let us just go from there he began writing this series in lets split the year as his start point this is years as of last month he has been working on this series assuming a job which is basically the bare minimum that is hours of work time in that span there is a general assumption of hours for a year of work for anyone who doesnt know where i got that number it wasnt out of my ass this means in this time he has published in the asoiaf series words an hour revisions rewrites entire books scrapped sure ok but even double is words per hour of work that means in an entire fucking year he writes words roughly half a book his current pace is something roughly on the order of words every years so words a year words an hour so not only is going slowly hes slowing down a fucking shitload at the same time i dont even want to go breakdown how much someone like sanderson writes since id probably just end up more annoyed than i already am about how people cut grrm so much fucking slack look im fine in the sense of not my bitch in how long it might take what i find very stupid is defending this horrendous pace by saying the dude works harder than anyone else most in this sub since adwd came out i simultaneously got a degree worked part time streamed on twitch as sort of a fun hobby that i made some money at like hours pear year there alone and i fucking guarantee there would be a ton of people who work way way harder than i dodid i see them every single day and i marvel at their work ethic because i know i couldnt do it grrms ethic sucks and he likely wants to be retired and or not have people care about what he does all the time boo fucking hoo what a terrible problem to have at this point it has become so ridiculous it will taint forever this series for me the book may end up being insert your personal favorite book in terms of quality and love and i will still remember how silly this all was i think they do a great job on the tv series but it is at times a pale shadow of the creative detail from the books which only came to pass because who knows what coconut george fucks all day instead of typing even one fucking page in a word doc literally go type one page in word its words that is his literal pace as a professional writer anyways like i said that is the reality we live in and i have made peace with that i just find defending it stupid as all hell
asoiaf,not_removed,i read that he wrote million words for adwd that seems like a lot but then theres this hardcore comment weirds are amazing there was a guy at the tel who had written almost million words more than any journo
asoiaf,not_removed,hes said so himself but you cant deny he works hard yes yes i can if an actor an accountant or your doctor kept shirking his workload you would totally call him out on it just because you think creativity is magical doesnt make it so we could easily be at book by now getting rid for book and possibly we will never know because we arent seeing them
asoiaf,not_removed,we have no idea how hard he works all we know is its been years since his last book in this series and its becoming more and more clear that he isnt going to finish them he has stopped going to conventions so thats nice
asoiaf,not_removed,but hed be a dick and hes constantly talking about finishing it and working on it
asoiaf,not_removed,correct it isnt illegal for him to not finish the series but there is an unsaid agreement between writer and reader that the story will be finished at some point when the writer neglects to finish his story the readers are in their right to call him an asshole how many people would have started this series if they knew ahead of time that the writer wasnt going to finish it
asoiaf,not_removed,youre completely right but asoiaf has defined this generation and is now the benchmark for all medieval fantasy imagine if lotr was never finished asoiaf is on that level of greatness if not greater it would be a true shame if we never got to see the ending to characters which some like me literally grew up reading
asoiaf,not_removed,damn straight that is his right as i said i hope that hbo do him justice and finish his story well and it will always be his story he is an amazing writer but cmon it is very obvious to all of us that he has either fallen at least somewhat out of love with the story or he is having an incredibly hard time in writing it he seems to actually enjoy working on wild cards i really think that asoiaf might have become just a burden to him at this stage and if it has well then of course its his story and he is free to just let it go and allow hbo to complete it for him
asoiaf,not_removed,except that asoiaf is also written in person save for internal monologue person i went to watch father behead some guy person bran went to watch his father behead some guy
asoiaf,not_removed,uhhh grrm definitely doesnt write in first person its still third person limited
asoiaf,not_removed,art runs on passion thats kindof the point an artist doesnt owe you work they dont feel passionate about because youve previously bought and supported other work
asoiaf,not_removed,he really doesnt ive been with the series for what seven years now and im still aware its his series to finish or not finish
asoiaf,not_removed,so you chose to invest those hours because you liked the books he wrote that you paidwhat a book for and now he somehow owes you something other than what he gave you for that you paid edit a word
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i tried to frame that reply the same as the way a reply had been written earlier probably not explaining that well but it looks off to me too a day on heres the comment i was inspired by i hate this type of comment nobody is saying grrm owes them anything that doesnt mean we as fans cant be unhappy with the time he takes to write his books but ultimately yeah i agree people can whine and bitch about how long he takes with this difficult openended process all they want its obviously not constructive but also it doesnt do any tangible damage either nothing we can do can change the fact that he still has to sit down in front of a blank screen and produce incredibly dense layered worlds out of thin air youre point stands though everyone gets to decide what they want to do with their own time some people spend it creating incredibly dense layered worlds out of thin air others spend it whining of course youre right though its his time just as its our time the choice of how to spend it is ours edit formatting
asoiaf,not_removed,he probably owes his government taxes he might owe a bank money on a house or a car or something doubt that though did you loan him money if so maybe he does owe you something but he certainly owes me nothing
asoiaf,not_removed,that isnt true i like many things about the show though there was more to like about it as an adaptation of the books in the early seasons now i mostly appreciate the spectacle and aesthetics im certainly not being ridiculous i shared an idea with you all that i enjoy entertaining no need to get your titties in a twist about it p
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe the kids are saying rekt these days yeah rekt
asoiaf,not_removed,of course it just made me think of the author dealing with publishing drama and red tape in ur meanwhile some ancient version of preston jacobs is bugging him about whether utnapishtun is enkidus dad or not
asoiaf,not_removed,pls stop yelling
asoiaf,not_removed,the worst part is that he forced everyone to read all of his other meandering crap news and opinions before posting it that mans dog is like the proverbial kid whose mom tied a pork chop around his neck so dogs would play with him
asoiaf,not_removed,he doesnt write his blog for people like you he never has its not asoiaf news its his personal update blog about everything he does and is interested in i honestly dont get why people like yourself cant get this through your heads stop reading his blog i dont read it because im interested in asoiaf not grrms other interests particularly and its clear that asoiaf is the thing he leasts posts about there hes always said that the announcement would be clear there would be no fuckery why do you people keep getting your hopes up everytime how was it not clear that the last year announcement would end with its not done yet only yourselves to blame for your obsessive frustrations and sure grrm for taking so long writing but you guys just make it worse for yourselves nothing about those seem trolly either aye he saves winds for last but to fuck with his fans hes not a teenager man why save it for last who knows maybe cause its the most depressing post of the lot get all the more positive stuff out of the way fuck i dont know hes not writing that blog for fans like you even though he probably knows you read them christ this pityparty its a fucking book hes a slow writer do something else with your life man if grrms shitty lack of progress pisses you off so much why give any of this the time of day do something else with your life find stories and writers that are worth your time because i dont think grrm seems to be
asoiaf,not_removed,can we use disappointment to force him to finish the series
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i assumed that but it just sounded odd to me to celebrate a day that was set in fiction i can understand celebrating the day the book came out that contained the event thats why i was confused since it just sounded so weird to me
asoiaf,not_removed,i think it was more of an issue that daenerys was moving too fast and he had to stall her for a book where he hadnt planned anything
asoiaf,not_removed,never
asoiaf,not_removed,well based on the statement that he though he could end it in months but it has been almost a year i would say indefinitely away for the basis of my statement i would also like to add the last line at the end of affc where he said that hopefully we will get adwd next year so he thought a year would be enough but it was so yeah no exact way to determine if anything he says about the hopeful release date holds any water
asoiaf,not_removed,your assuming the months estimate was based on reality and not wishful thinking since he wanted to beat season envision this scenario its the middle of george knows if he doesnt get the book out before the next season they are going to surpass the published material he really doesnt want this to happen however hes only about half way to maybe of the way done suddenly he has an epiphany he can just really buckle down and work on the book really hard for the next few months and finish its a genius plan sure to work after all he needs to beat season and still has a bunch of months left to do so the deadline is set email sent to publisher i think i can have the book done in a few months if that happens we can publish before season right then time passes and its the end of unfortunately his writing pace didnt pick up he wrote a few more chapters sure but not enough to get close to finishing he still has of the book to go that is totally plausible imo and explains him thinking he was months away a year ago and us still not having any news
asoiaf,not_removed,he used to say dance was some months away the entire time there is a post about his comments somewhere
asoiaf,not_removed,is there any other possible outcome its a fucking army of the undead murdering the living how is there a grey area
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly in the books the others give off very alien vibes theres a lot more going on with them than it appears they arent just generic evil mooks
asoiaf,not_removed,even if that part of my comment was uncalledfor that doesnt give you the right to attack him constantly and needlessly
asoiaf,not_removed,fuck yeah bro
asoiaf,not_removed,hear hear
asoiaf,not_removed,but to be fair being an artist isnt like say working at a fastfood restaurant there isnt a linear relation between the amount of hours spent working and the amount of work done one day you can struggle to write page and another day you can rapidly fill pages with plenty of energy to spare and while some artists can regularly produce large amounts of work in short periods of time grrm isnt that type of writer if he were asoiaf as we know it would be completely different less rich for sure and it may not have the large following it has today i think youre disconnected from how rich and complex asoiaf is if he decides to change one scene for example itll have a domino effect and hed have to rewrite pages imagine writing something like that making it all come together and connect in his position i know i would have given up in despair long long ago
asoiaf,not_removed,the lord of the rings is only words more than asos alone the asoiaf books are enormous the books in total are like million words so far by the time it ends is should have well over million words harry potter only has about million
asoiaf,not_removed,uh you really think asoiaf has defined this generation in any way or or that asoiaf is a benchmark for all medieval fantasy you simply cant be serious ill give you hbos got as a benchmark for medieval fantasy production but thats only because hbos rome is neither medieval nor fantasy i dont watch much tv really but im fairly confident that the musical scores and costumes and shocking moments if they make sense or not in got will indeed be some sort of benchmark i play that music all the time genius stuff
asoiaf,not_removed,if lotr were unfinished no one would notice with the possible exception of a few academics you could say that asoiaf is a victim of grrms success in todays connected world
asoiaf,not_removed,just curious have you read any of the wild cards stories are they any good i dont use goodreads or even amazon reviews anymore since super fans brigade with ratingsreviews such sites have become about as useless as imdb reviews these days
asoiaf,not_removed,ive come to believe its first person one pov made to look person limited multiple povs that part would be a little brilliant if he wrote a first person pov about a writer writing person povs ill have to see if its been done before without the horrible all just a dream trope being employed
asoiaf,not_removed,youre right hes made millions of dollars on the premise of telling his fanbase this story but that shouldnt compel him to finish the story or anything people buy these books on the assumption that there will be an end
asoiaf,not_removed,it was truly the troll of the decade imo —and hell do it again im sure another lost post maybe hell give us a number though i had to change some things but im at a solid manuscript pages imagine the fury i just laugh at it now but i did enjoy the threads that day things got a bit testy if i recall but then everyone sort of came together which was pretty cool
asoiaf,not_removed,dude lmao i assure you i am not pissed nor having a pityparty nor am i even a dude —though i do watch cfb quite incessantly and find his understanding of football quite atrocious so i dont read his blog as a rule as it might really piss me off i want to send him cfb because he mixes up cfb and nfl rules that bad maybe hes trolling about his football enjoyment as well just because im fairly sure eh sure hes trolling doesnt mean i hate him or anyting though and i had actual fun on the new years reddit thread due to the community here though i was under no illusion that he would announce twow my goto date which im now abandoning fully has been for years —though im now changing that to a never we have quite a fun community here and i fully intend to enjoy the same new years threads of george trolling goodness at least until the show ends and the storys over i suppose lol i want you to know that many of us can appreciate a good troll especially when the characters are now in hbos hands and hopefully brought to some sort of ending that goes way further than georges i have a dream ending get it dream of spring it was all a dream trope lovely isnt it lmao 😂 but i am become quite protective of my brahs up in here and hate to see them squirm that is true i like keeping shit lighthearted hell i dont want the troll of the century to actually affect anyone negatively i love my rasoiaf peeps how on earth could i possibly think such a brilliant troll could be someone to despise hes quite hilarious when seen that way once you see it all his ssms are even more glorious sure i was a little pissed when it first hit me the literary equivalent of lost tv especially after that dog book adwd which took eleven years from asos btw which already had me giving up on the series in the but but then i saw the utter brilliance of trolling the world in this way people will be pissed at first but a good troll is nothing to be laughed at imagine the enormity of the task trying not to laugh you see it in yt interviews when asked serious questions about stupid storylines hes made mockery of nearly every single critic who breathes air and that is glorious
asoiaf,not_removed,this account is going into hibernation until spring arrivederci
asoiaf,not_removed,you are so rightif he can mistake one year of writing for sjx you cant trust his estimates anymore
asoiaf,not_removed,but hes had to do less rewriting for this book hasnt he his current rate is like one book per years so twow is due soon and he spent a lot of time during the wait between books and advising on the show which is one reason it took so long and lets not forget the meereenese knot
asoiaf,not_removed,i wonder if he is as keen finishing before season
asoiaf,not_removed,i really believe its different this time that itll come out soon
asoiaf,not_removed,how about we wait until grrm releases his book before we make claims as if theyre fact
asoiaf,not_removed,it doesnt help that the search function is traaaaash
asoiaf,not_removed,yes it does because this is the internet and freedom of speech is a thing
asoiaf,not_removed,as a fan of wheel of time since i was and ive read that series in totality more than i like to count i dont know i think i understand just how complex it is i picked up asoiaf in based on robert jordans recommendation d even if i dont truly understand because then i could write and profit off of it i can at least compare between those who do robert jordan brandon sanderson the malazhar fallen guy i forget his name i dont know the list goes on complex worlds written at a pace that is so much faster that even if grrm is more complex and better his pace still sucks ass
asoiaf,not_removed,but lotr and hp actually made sense they were completed they are considered greats at least in a fun romp sense and comparatively to other great literature asoiaf simply isnt its neither finished nor sensical as it stands now step back and look at it at all the various storylines that might be best completed by a sept blow rendering most loose ends null and void im just not sure we should compare actual proven authors novelsseries to grrms asoiaf yet and really word count is a stupid measure of a novels value and imo can actually detract from a storys value
asoiaf,not_removed,no i havent read any of them but i just get the sense from his blogging that he has a blast with them
asoiaf,not_removed,first person view with one viewpoint has its own difficulties though grrm relies heavily on meanwhile back on the farm style of storytelling for asoiaf its pretty standard in movies to build up several storyline and viewpoints at once switching when you hit the peak of a scene the biggest advantage is that you can keep the audiences attention and switch over when one storyline slows down with only one viewpoint however youre forced to keep following one character and so you have to find other ways of keeping the readers attention multiple viewpoints also is an easy way of expanding the scope and the setting but it takes more creativity to do the same with one character
asoiaf,not_removed,id rather there be no end than read halfdigested and forcedout drivel written by a whipped brokenwilled man p
asoiaf,not_removed,why do you think hes trolling i mean literally taking his fans for a ride for his own personal amusement from my point of view it sounds more like a coping mechanism for shitty delays than having any basis in reality like similar theories as hes given up writing altogether or even weirder hes writing twow and ados at the same time unless youre not really being serious and im being far too literal and dense right now if you are im honestly not trying to slag you off or anything but i dont really understand those points of view sorry about the tone before your first post read as very angry and irritated and i usually try to be more friendly even if i do disagree with other fans
asoiaf,not_removed,also true
asoiaf,not_removed,his current rate is nonexistent or at least inconsistent to be taken as a foundation for any realistic calculation here are the distances between books to years and a half to a year and a half and this was his largest book until adwd larger than books and to years to years im certain that he can write faster even in his old age but right now i wont get any hopes up until i get an official announcement will it come until the end of year highly possibly but that means nothing until we have the announcement
asoiaf,not_removed,sure you can think this and nice that you can remain optimistic but i just see no evidence for this and even if comes out soon it has to come out eventually anyway sooner or later someone is right with a prediction
asoiaf,not_removed,youll be waiting another years then
asoiaf,not_removed,how about we wait until grrm releases his book before we make claims as if theyre fact none of us have that much time
asoiaf,not_removed,just because you can doesnt mean you should
asoiaf,not_removed,im comparing the quantity not the quality because people claim grrm doesnt produce much work and the show is not the books and until the books are done i dont think its fair to criticize the overabundance of storylines because he might resolve it satisfactorily
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah definitely its something he is really excited about last i read no denying it i understand he edits more than writes wc last i heard some early ones are out of print wonder if theyre the ones he contributed to
asoiaf,not_removed,oh no i dont get angry and irritated over entertainment anymore i did once never again im about to walk away from oitnb at ep its good to walk away when youre not enjoying something any longer and im still here i think its possible george is having fun trolling might sound harsh but its really not trolling to be evil but something readers could look back on and laugh at one day in a positive way and talk to grandkids about or something like how at bubicon when people called for aerons chapter and george laughed and called them sick motherfuckers we know he doesnt think were sick mfers and the work is from his brain so he doesnt think hes a sick mfer either any more than any other human i dont mind a good troll especially if it turns out to be clever shoot i appreciate a good trolling if done well and imo clearly his is done in fun i still dont think hes depressed though accepting maybe but still with a smile on his face honestly and i havent been saying this at all i think its likely george has most of twow written and has had explaining many of his comments last year and this year but that uh this will sound so pretentious and i really dont know its true but i have some older interviews that i think sheds light on things where he said he started this thing in the early and it hadnt been done fresh story break out of tolkien mode and id wager twow would have been shocking and burnpile worthy even back then but not rage quit worthy as it might be now since in the last years one or two postmodern series have tried an idea that did not go over well though cult followers still say otherwise he is known to hate it which ive known for years he raged against one of them actually and i mean raged i now believe the solution to most of his puzzles are right in our faces but of the same ilk as the odious series which failed so now its a really unpopular method of storytelling yeah i speak as though i know and i dont but ive been working on putting together his interviews and believe i picked up on a tell that makes things make sense and ive tried dripping hints of the possible story and indeed they were met with personal attacks my bad i shouldve kept my trap shut it would indeed not be popular and i think thats his hangup twow should end on this shocking twist that explains why we havent had answers and stuff it would almost have to i think so i imagine hes reworking the outline to hammer it out so people wont ragequit the series ultimately through no fault of his own mind you but because others jumped on similar methods of story telling and fucked them all to hell and now avoid them like the plague if im right it explains de why we dont have much of it yet and a lot of things and is indeed fairly disappointing until you remember that theres a whole other book after twow which would change most of what we thought we knew about asoiaf and be more in line with some original goals he stated but hadnt yet lived up to antiwar fixing the seasons etc his trick would be to get twow published and past people without having them want to murder him lol but ados would be the right way to handle this method of storytelling and things would be made right again and make sense without grrm being seen as a sicko or perv or anything i mean hes all but said it several times over the decades and hes even notoriously expressed worry in an interview that his work this was prehbo premiere i think would be seen that negatively hell id thought he was talking about adwd lol so ultimately i think twow is done but being reworked so it will still keep its flavor but not change the game so much that people go a bookburnin he wants it to be wellreceived but it also has to be controversial and a worthy penultimate it should leave us confused and angry but he has to back it up some because of the unpopularity of the idea again no fault of his own others have tried and failed miserably at this method of storytelling or twist i guess the positive the show has to do it first now already has sort of and really grrm has warned fans that hes not big into wars or not to look at timelines and distances we just werent listening i fear so no im not into slamming grrm except jokingly i think he might pull this puppy out yet but i think itll get worse before it gets better heh dream of spring and if you think about it like how sure he seemed last year that hed need months to publish before yeah twow is ready but hes probably opted to rework it to be less odious though i cant imagine how so he can give us a meaningful ados that could tie everything together and get his baby out without bad things happening so i try to keep things lighthearted disclaimer im guessing totally but youd completely ignore me if i mentioned the fail series and how it has any relation to asoiaf it may not regardless i seriously like a lighthearted relaxed sub and i think grrm will ultimately publish ill keep this note so i can point others to it if they ask fuck it took forever to write lol
asoiaf,not_removed,so be it better than making egregious claims
asoiaf,not_removed,that wasnt the point though the point was whether people have the right they clearly do
asoiaf,not_removed,are you talking about lost and how the flash sideways alternate universe turned out to be a sort of purgatory i say that cause you mentioned lost in an earlier post if so ill add that i liked that twist i was an obsessed lost fanatic and sort of became a bit irritated that the show was spending so much time on this alternate universe and worried the finale would end with some dumb crossover with jack and jackx or whatever so i was glad hey were ultimately about giving closure to the story arcs of our main characters so you think this will tie into asoiaf somehow if not sorry for yappinga bout lost i could talk your ear off about that show so perhaps its best to keep that lid firmly closed lol
asoiaf,not_removed,i misspoke i obviously wasnt trying to say that people dont have the right to do so i thought that was clear
asoiaf,not_removed,clearly not pun intended
asoiaf,not_removed,if benjen relayed him the news he probably would have sent as many men possible to the wall and treat with mance rayder to see the extremity of this threat for himself
asoiaf,not_removed,at first he would be in denial as he was when benjen mentioned weird activity by the wildlings and some of nws own rangers after being convinced he would have most likely tried to take care of it himself with help from his bannermen
asoiaf,not_removed,im not even sure it would have to be benjen if the old bear sent word to him that theyd definitively seenfought others and wights i think he had enough respect for mormont that hed believe him and do what he could to help of course ned being alive basically means theres not a war raging across the kingdoms so it would be much easier for him to send his forces north to help defend the wall
asoiaf,not_removed,hed likely just send most of the armies of the north to the wall thousand men defending the wall would probably still lose in a fight with the others but ned would likely believe that would be all that is needed
asoiaf,not_removed,well one thing is obvious if ned and robert stayed alive and ned kept on being the hand jon would send a raven straight to his father the hand wholl believe him and force the entire realm to prepare for the long night but of course this situation relies on many ifs
asoiaf,not_removed,if he was in winterfell yes the north would have a much more coordinated effort against the others but if he survived in kl there wouldnt be much he could do
asoiaf,not_removed,neds hubris honor would make him want to speak with mance first oneonone then the wildlings would kill him likely behead him the man was meant to die no matter what
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel as if ned would have granted the wildlings land in the north if they agreed to man the other empty castles on the wall it kills two three eyed crows with one stone yes it would be difficult to sustain as winter is coming but it would probably be possible
asoiaf,not_removed,weird activity would probably just mean that mance is moving faster than expected you dont really think that the monsters from thousands of years ago that you arent even sure really exist are coming back now
asoiaf,not_removed,ned was very headstrong he would likely try to do it himself this would probably lead to his demise should he use only his bannermen ned wouldnt stand much of a chance against the arm of the dead furthermore no one would be able to hurt the others as ice was more of a ceremonial weapon he didnt actively use it in battle it was much too large
asoiaf,not_removed,lets say that the hand allister thorne showed tyrion was shown to ned what would happen in that case i would imagine ned would empty the castle dungeons to send to the watch thats pretty definitive proof especially if sent with a letter from mormont
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think mance would kill him if they could reach a peaceful solution mance only wants to help his people reach safety ned is the key to this assuming mance would kill him immediately is asinine
asoiaf,not_removed,theyd destroy any chance of making an alliance with the northern lords and all their men by killing the guy who might have been willing to actually make an alliance with them and honor doesnt demand that speak to mance face to face
asoiaf,not_removed,ned fought with ice during the greyjoy rebellion so he could have used it
asoiaf,not_removed,no it wasnt swords that were basically what ice is described as being are a bit of an anachronism for the setting theyre slightly too late for a lot of the rest of the tech but theyre totally legit as battlefield weapons the swiss and german mercenaries who are associated with them used to give an extra allowance to the pay of any man who could use one because they were really effective in skilled hands theyre called zweihanders or doppelhanders grrms quite weird about sword stuff in general actually its one of the things he really screws up
asoiaf,not_removed,in theory if the war of kings doesnt happen which it obviously wouldnt happen if hes dealing with the threat all armies involved would be much stronger in the boltons and wildlingsstark loyalists both have armies in the range of the north raised for the war of kings and its my impression they had some reserves behind that so in theory he might have been able to call on a bigger more professional army than what jon is going to have it depends on how bad the mance v the north war gets though i guess
asoiaf,not_removed,didnt the hand rot before he was able to show it it depends on who the king is and who else has power in kl but even if the hand didnt rot im sure there would be other more pressing matters to deal with but yeah he would have treated the watch better than anyone else but its not like he would be able to send an army or something
asoiaf,not_removed,i was half joking i am no george rr martin
asoiaf,not_removed,read my response to mat
asoiaf,not_removed,werent zweihanders used only because of specific battle settings though as far as i know their main appeal was that they worked well against spears
asoiaf,not_removed,the north at full strength is closer to
asoiaf,not_removed,the hand rotted because the lannisters kept putting him off and putting him off they knew ser alliser had come down and had something for them they just kept pushing him to the back of the line because they dont give two shits for the prison colony on the wall ned probably wouldnt have done that if he was acting as hand and was told a man of the nights watch is here my lord he says he must see you hed make time
asoiaf,not_removed,wow you actually spelled my real name correctly ive been using matt in my usernames since but my nickname is mat i commend you sir
asoiaf,not_removed,they were extremely good against spears and other long pole weapons but that wasnt their sole use they could also be used to boost pike or spear formations and could make up a sizeable percentage of troops if you had spear or pikemen which most armies did because its a lot easier to teach someone with limited military experience to use a spear quickly than it is to teach them the sword you would have a core of specialised zweihanders to stick in the formation with them and help them hold one particularly well known group of century mercenaries had a total strength of between men with zweihanders highly skilled and functionally unable to have any other weapon except a dagger with them while they were carrying the big fuck off swords made up about percent of that total with about of them to work with pikemen thats a lot of men to keep if you can only use them when the battlefield is exactly right it was specialised yes strictly an infantry weapon so ned would not be fighting on horseback with it hed have to ride and then dismount and requiring quite a different technique to make use of its length when compared to the more usual longsword actually twohanded a lot of the time not one handed as grrm has it or the arming swordbut it wasnt so specialised that it was useless
asoiaf,not_removed,im trying to work out what youre asking here but im really not sure do we read povs in first person i dont understand theyre written in third person how could you read them any other way do you just ignore everything other than the dialogue and the thoughts and skip over the rest that seems like an awkward way of navigating your way through a page even the vocabulary of a character will be expressed in the actions and descriptions of events happening for that pov what what does that mean
asoiaf,not_removed,you do know what pov means right
asoiaf,not_removed,what
asoiaf,not_removed,when i read asoiaf my mind tend to envision everything happening on page as if it happened on liveaction tv main difference being that i can hear the povs thoughts so if it says tyrion really didnt like that in the book my mind will translate it to a mental image of tyrion thinking well i really dont like that ¯ツ¯
asoiaf,not_removed,here i stand but youre sitting
asoiaf,not_removed,i see daenerys as the sacrifice demanded by the night king to have a queen by his side jorah will take the black and stand on the wall yellingkhaleeeesiiiiiiiii lol
asoiaf,not_removed,jorahfanboy heh there is one person deserves to climb those stairs and set his royal butt on the it and his name is stannis the mannis of house baratheon reborn stannisazore ahai will be reborn amidst salt and smoke he will wake a stone dragon fight the others and the others will bend their knees to his grace and swear him fealty the king that was promised king stannis marches with his new soldierskings men others wights to face his enemies and he will destroy all those false kings queens and gods and he will conquer all of westeros and the rest of the world because its his duty one realm one god one king the one true king is in the throne room with all his loyal lords and all the noble people from essos to swear fealty to king stannis the king of all planetos and protector of the realm king stannis takes his crown and set on the iron throne grinding his teeth then he smiles and says one realm one god one king credits roll
asoiaf,not_removed,assuming you meant to post this on rgameofthrones
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry greyscale was acting up
asoiaf,not_removed,hi im going to remove this because we dont permit fanfic here in rasoiaf thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,in the books doesnt manderly mention to davos he doesnt trust his own maester because he was born a lannister it doesnt seem all too far fetched for in a world where the house is everything many maesters to in fact use their positions in order to advance the goals of the family that they were born into id actually be rather curious to know what families the other maesters named in the series belong to as it could provide a whole new dimension to a lot of the plotting that goes on
asoiaf,not_removed,any evidence to support this
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt it obvious his name is tybald which starts with the same prefix as tywin and tyrion thats pretty solid
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe if you change the letters around tybald is bytlad byt lad bit lad what lad was bit in the show joffrey was bite tybald is joffrey confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,and book tywin was bald its right there in black and white man
asoiaf,not_removed,tymond lannister tybolt lannister tytos lannister tywin lannister tyrion lannister it not as tinfoily as it sounds
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrek tygett tywell tyland tya tymond etc did you mean tynfoil
asoiaf,not_removed,tysha tycho nestoris tyene sand
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrells
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess its legit for tysha since shes from the westerlands too
asoiaf,not_removed,she was a crofters daughter and became a lannister for five minutes when she married tyrion she obviously was not a secret lannister
asoiaf,not_removed,thats not what i meant what im saying is that names starting with ty may be typical from the westerlands thus the greatest house of the former kingdom surely use such names while its not forbidden for lowborns to name their children like that
asoiaf,not_removed,well i mean she was a secret lannister tywin really probably didnt want word of his son no matter how impishly handsome he was marrying a baseborn something going around
asoiaf,not_removed,how long they take to write
asoiaf,not_removed,books were each well defined narratives with interconnected storylines and clearly defined themes the books themselves and also the various character arcs each have distinct beginnings middles and ends books and however are a series of vignettes they feel more like anthology collections with most of the characters existing completely independently from one another this was a huge departure in narrative structure and style to me it feels like a different author and the final chapters for many of the main characters were cliffhangers thats pretty frustrating when youre waiting over years for the next chapter i think deadline described the series like this in the four years from to martin published three complete books in the years since he has published one unfinished book spread across two volumes
asoiaf,not_removed,i dislike the meereen storyline it is not the writing i just feel it is a big distraction from the main story and there will be no satisfaction when it ends we know dany will burn some slavers pack up leave and not return so that storyline will end abruptly with her departure and we will not see how meereen turns out
asoiaf,not_removed,the ironborn chapters brienne in affc
asoiaf,not_removed,most of briennes chapters in feast the gratuitous world building made me seriously start to question if grrm was losing the plot i also found myself skim reading meereen chapters fairly early on in adwd at this point i think the only thing that could save meereen for me is dany deliberately burning it to the groundwhich i really dont see happening
asoiaf,not_removed,i aggree that tyrion gets pretty predictable and annyoing with the progression of the series he always is getting treated badly but because he is so smart or some random luckdany in the pits his owner dying suddenly he gets out of the situation always with some witty rhetorical comebacks i dont feel scared for him i dont cheer him on anymore grrm told that he was his favourite character and you notice this more and more it is just always bad situation super cool solution because he has the smarts
asoiaf,not_removed,the plot armor id rather george just didnt put the characters in those positions rather than come up with plot contrivances to get them out of trouble
asoiaf,not_removed,other than how long we have to wait between book publications probably lady stoneheart im not a fan of the character or the storyline shes probably going to end up being very important to the plot but i just dont like her
asoiaf,not_removed,sansa i honestly wish joffrey was back just to put her head on a spike and put the rest of us out of our misery
asoiaf,not_removed,briennes povs in affc
asoiaf,not_removed,his ongoing descriptions of food hell twow would be done if he wasnt talking about the feast and wine oh and how it dripped down themselves hes like racheal ray and hannibal lechtor combined
asoiaf,not_removed,lady stoneheart we already have beric to show that resurrection is possible so she is redundant i know lots of people have different theories on important stuff she might do in the future but in my mind that just makes it worse because it takes away from some of the brilliance of the red wedding think about it the pov character for the red wedding one of the best most shocking events in literary fantasy is not only not fully dead but goes on to do something important after that that would lessen the brilliance of the red wedding to me and if she doesnt do anything of significant importance to the plot then there was literally zero point in her not just staying dead because we already had beric i think george kinda just overthought this and wanted to put in something else to shock or horrify us but lsh doesnt make any sense to me and i wish he had left her out
asoiaf,not_removed,this is the only real answer imo
asoiaf,not_removed,i wish we only had dany povs in got then in the next books we only hear stuff like her dragons conquered x city burned y person etc
asoiaf,not_removed,i just feel it is a big distraction from the main story and there will be no satisfaction when it ends i agree with this right here its felt for way too long like grrm is just vamping when it comes to danys storyline at this point he didnt have any actual plot for her between getting dragons and coming back to westeros so now hes just chucking out whatever works
asoiaf,not_removed,its hard to say yet how important the meereen story is to the overall main storyline so far i think a lot of the lessons dany learns and development she undergoes will be crucial to her as she comes to westeros im sure you could make the argument that it could be shorter but i feel in its current form it shows us a lot of her faults and shortcomings as a leader we will see a more confidant dany with biggermore ezperienced dragons because of her time there meereen is my least favorite storyline but i think it will payoff well and be worth it in the big picture
asoiaf,not_removed,yes im one of those dreaded lsh haters also
asoiaf,not_removed,he has exactly the same style for describing food and sex
asoiaf,not_removed,if you think the books are without flaws then i have to disagree they are far from perfect nothing is perfect but they are great
asoiaf,not_removed,the question was not about flaws the books have plenty the question was what do you hate most the thing i hate most is how long martin takes to write them where did i say the books are perfect
asoiaf,not_removed,nowhere i made an assumption my mistake
asoiaf,not_removed,no worries
asoiaf,not_removed,i forget exactly when this happened chronologically but i believe it was just before euron takes over the ironborn i think it was just intended as foreshadowing of what was to come i dont think saan ever personally raided with euron as they seem to have pretty contrasting personalities but im certain hes heard of him as theyre both powerful pirates
asoiaf,not_removed,since the crowseye is reaving along the mander could you see saan teaming up with euron i could see saan teaming up with pretty much anyone if the moneys right
asoiaf,not_removed,this is why i love grrm always the one with the foreshadowing
asoiaf,not_removed,is it possible that saan a well known pirate knows or even raided along side another well known pirate euron greyjoy i think it makes more sense that saan would work with aurane waters
asoiaf,not_removed,wow that first sentence could use some commas sure euron has to be pretty infamous so it would make sense that there would be stories about him and there arent many port cities so they very well could have crossed paths i doubt it means they have a secret alliance or something like that if saan has a secret alliance with anyone its with illyrio because saans grandfather was one of the ninepenny kings
asoiaf,not_removed,he must have heard of euron they are a notorious pirate feared across the world so yeh foreshadowing
asoiaf,not_removed,wow and yours could use periods sure euron has to be pretty infamous it would make sense that there would be stories about him however there arent many port cities they very well could have crossed paths i doubt it means they have a secret alliance or something like that if saan has a secret alliance with anyone its with illyrio this is due to saans grandfather whom was one of the ninepenny kings
asoiaf,not_removed,bran he started it and he shouldwill finish it
asoiaf,not_removed,bran or sam
asoiaf,not_removed,assuming ados has an epilogue it will likely be a small character who probably hasnt even been introduced yet i wouldnt mind george doing a bit of a timeskip forward for the epilogue to see how westeros looks like in the aftermath of the storys resolution even if it would be cliched
asoiaf,not_removed,sam it will be an epilogue of him serving as a maester preserving history of the more conteoversial skeptical and magical events he has encountered as tradition sam has to die in this chapter but it will be in his bed and he will be as old as aemon
asoiaf,not_removed,an omniscient perspective from bran the greenseer he started this story hell end it
asoiaf,not_removed,i think it will be bran or sansa my personal desire is that we have an epilogue chapter from old nan telling kids the story of ice and fire
asoiaf,not_removed,patchface i know i know oh oh oh
asoiaf,not_removed,half of my gut says bran the other says that bran is going to perform the ultimate sacrifice and die somehow and if thats the case then itll be jon or dany with the last chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,but arent davos sons all dead i like to think it will be tyrion alone on his vineyard or something i can see the last scene of the show being him relaxing with some wine and finally finishing his joke about the ass and the honeysuckle
asoiaf,not_removed,it should be one of the characters from agot my guess is bran as he seeks isolation from all the death and destruction
asoiaf,not_removed,in main chapters bran i want an epilouge in the future showing how the world adapts after the second long night is over maybe the pov could be a grandchild of a character who is themselves very young in the main story i think a grandchild of the starks if they survive and telling what the world is like whilst themselves dying of old age
asoiaf,not_removed,no one
asoiaf,not_removed,epilogue to be rhaegars final days from his little chat with jaime to his death at the trident i think its a nice way to go back to the start
asoiaf,not_removed,following the theory that the song of ice and fire will be tyrions great song im figuring it will be him if the gods are good finishing his manuscript and settling down to bed with a belly full of wine and a whore around his cock
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion dying at the age of eighty with a bellyful of wine and a girls mouth around his cock
asoiaf,not_removed,bran
asoiaf,not_removed,the last chapter will be bran the epilogue will be someone else probably somewhere in the haunted forest and it will reveal that the others arent quite as defeated as our heroes think
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry finally rowing all the way back to kings landing finding it burned to the ground and everyone dead and just saying what the fuck
asoiaf,not_removed,dany had the last agot chapter bran the last acok chapter sansa the last asos chapter sam the last affc chapter and dany the last adwd chapter again of the original cast only jon arya and tyrion havent ended a book so im going with one of those three
asoiaf,not_removed,i like the idea of it being rhaegar like that somehow the ending was known from the beginning
asoiaf,not_removed,strong belwas
asoiaf,not_removed,im personally think bran however i have a slight suspicion that it may be the chapter of a young child of one of the characters to show if all ends reasonably well that this chapter of westerosi history is over but the new one is just beginning im not sure whose the child would be but it would be a satisfactory way to end the books imo
asoiaf,not_removed,davos well im back he said
asoiaf,not_removed,hopefully rickon or i want the epilogue to be his if youre not counting that as the final chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,i think it will be bran stark his pov chapter started off the series hell finish it reflecting on everything that has happened
asoiaf,not_removed,moonboy for all i know
asoiaf,not_removed,arya
asoiaf,not_removed,the doom of westeros ala valyria please
asoiaf,not_removed,arya or bran i just get the feeling that these two would be the most plausible
asoiaf,not_removed,itll be an epilogue with a bard as the pov singing the song of ice and fire
asoiaf,not_removed,always felt that it would be bran with the final chapter even more so if the title for final book a dream of spring is staying thought of it like this winter would begin to end once the dragon riders sacrifice to defeat the others ending those povs preventing those from being the last ones bran at winterfell seeing the reconstruction and remembering what it was at the start of book maybe throw some more dreams of the past or other locations through weirwoodnet to show how povs elsewhere ended from someone elses perspective or something end it all with that night he had a dream of spring
asoiaf,not_removed,it has to be bran it started with bran and it will end with bran
asoiaf,not_removed,nights king first appearance of his pov and of course last dies edit but somehow grrm gets everyone to feel sorry for his death
asoiaf,not_removed,the last chapter will be bran waking up from his coma and realising that the whole story was just a dream
asoiaf,not_removed,hbo
asoiaf,not_removed,davos hasnt really been through all kinds of stuff he fought in the battle of the blackwater and thats about it he was a prisoner at white harbor and dragonstone i guess and to be fair who knows what will happen on skagos
asoiaf,not_removed,it is possible for the warg to live a type of second life a much simpler life inside the mind of an animal he controls in the second life the skinchangers memory slowly fades until nothing of the man is left and only the beast remains maybe it will be jon inside ghost however i dislike the way some people treat the story as if jon is the main character ending the series with jon would affirm that idea leaving me with a brand of bittersweetness that i dont think grrm intended on one hand jon could sacrifice himself and live on in ghost and that would be poetic because his name is ghost it would be bittersweet because hes dead but still around maybe hell roam the north and people will tell stories about the white wolf who protects the land maybe thats too much of a fairy tale ending but grrm is a fantasy lover and a closet romantic so i wouldnt put it past him he gives us fairy tale endings all the time but he makes them cool and interesting by shrouding them in mystery and giving them a brutal twist examples gravedigger stoneheart first dornish war on the other hand if anyone seems set up for a tragedy followed by a second life its arya arya could be the lone wolf who when she dies will survive as nymeria and finally have a family again it would be her last identity change in a long sad tale of identity struggle mostly ive always wondered if grrm could pull off a warged chapter and i think a wolfs description of the aftermath of a battle for the dawn would be a cool way to vaguely show us how everything ended without making explicit the specifics of who won or who survived what if bran jon and arya all end up in their wolves the last chapter could be a multipov from the perspective of a pack i think thats too tragic even for grrm
asoiaf,not_removed,sam
asoiaf,not_removed,im of the opinion that bran is going to be pretty critical going towards the end of the story and i suspect it could very well end on him
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion reading to his grandchildren about the adventures he was a part of decades earlier
asoiaf,not_removed,bran
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion i cant put to words exactly why i think that i just do so far hes been in kl winterfell the wall with jon across the narrow sea and is most likely on his way to dany hes a common thread if dany and jon and the lannisters are the main players hes like the narrator and grrm has said hes his favourite
asoiaf,not_removed,bran
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty sure davos has run out of children maybe im misremembering and he only lost his sons though
asoiaf,not_removed,probably an epilogue with a random new character establishing the lay of the land and ending in a minor cliffhanger
asoiaf,not_removed,i assume the final chapter will be an epilogue so i think it will be a bard from hundreds of years later
asoiaf,not_removed,george
asoiaf,not_removed,id like sam to be the last chapter but i believe hell burn when euron brings the apocalypse to oldtown i believe bran will be the last chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,the answer really depends on if there will be an epilogue chapter if so then i think the final pov might be from someone who had previously never gotten a chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,maester samwell tarly documenting or lecturing about the events of asoiaf otherwise tyrion would be fantastic
asoiaf,not_removed,the final chapter will be an epilogue probably focusing around sam the final pov chapter will probably be bran or maybe tyrion
asoiaf,not_removed,hodor all in hodorish
asoiaf,not_removed,bran will have the last nonepilogue chapter and the epilogue will take place years and years later and be a retelling of the song of ice and fire
asoiaf,not_removed,i think bran but it will be years in the future long after bran resumes his role as the new
asoiaf,not_removed,bran didnt the george say he would bookend the series
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe it will end with a mummers troupe playing to a lordking in the far of future finishing off the tale instead of a pov character after all this is a song of ice and fire
asoiaf,not_removed,my money is on sam
asoiaf,not_removed,bran or some samwell the amazing writing a book on history of this time
asoiaf,not_removed,i honestly hope its tyrion i can see him reflecting on everything just thinking of how he could explain how a high born dwarf who spent most of his life in the bottom of a wine cask or between the legs of a brothel whore is a kinslayer and accused kingslayer was able to rise up to be the hand of the most power ruler in the world without becoming a bite sized snack for one of her dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,bran so he can have a greenseer epilogue
asoiaf,not_removed,nymeria
asoiaf,not_removed,kevan lannister since twow is never coming out
asoiaf,not_removed,moonboy
asoiaf,not_removed,the final chapter is probably sansa traveling to the isle of faces to find something super important about the history of the world most likely something about the children and the others and then we get an epilogue of arya dying and warging into nymeria to live a second live and then we get a superepilogue with archmaester sam reflecting on everything at the citadel
asoiaf,not_removed,samwell hopefully
asoiaf,not_removed,the night king
asoiaf,not_removed,my gut says arya shell die and be with her pack
asoiaf,not_removed,the final chapter of the series quite the optimist arent you
asoiaf,not_removed,the nights king sitting on the iron throne smoking a cohiba duh
asoiaf,not_removed,hotpie
asoiaf,not_removed,sam
asoiaf,not_removed,jon on beach drinking a mojito smiling at warm sunset
asoiaf,not_removed,ned with him and all the dead characters looking down on planetos and smiling yes its stupid and cheesey yes its practically a plagiarism of les miserables where the horrible and cruel world we live in actually has an afterlife worth having yes it goes against what is stated in the show and books by those who have seen the afterlife or lack thereof beric and jon but seven damn it george dont we deserve that sweet little moment of wish fulfillment
asoiaf,not_removed,nymeria with arya dead she joins with nymeria finally becoming whole and at peace with her pack at her back observing spring returning
asoiaf,not_removed,pate
asoiaf,not_removed,it would be cool but unlikely if the chapters of the central characters bran arya jon tyrion daenerys sansa ended in reverse order to how they were introduced excluding will ned and cat the agot povs were introduced in this order bran daenerys jon arya tyrion sansa so it should end in this order sansa she probably dies long before the ending tyrion arya jon daenerys bran
asoiaf,not_removed,its gotta be bran looking down from his lofty position upon a new world of destruction and death everyone else will be dead and bran will be above it all
asoiaf,not_removed,please
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe this based on how the mistborn trilogy ended to those who have read it consider the type of character heshe was and what they brought to the table after all the events i find bran similar to that type of character and would make a great last chapter and president
asoiaf,not_removed,yep definitely gonna be bran
asoiaf,not_removed,well how about will in haeven
asoiaf,not_removed,yes bran — or whoever is taking care of him now then whenever it ends
asoiaf,not_removed,his name is summer
asoiaf,not_removed,not sam i think we can all agree that grrm has known the answer since the beginning right well he didnt even intend to make sam a pov character when he wrote agot you see he originally intended to write the whole series with the original povs found in agot but when he started what became acok he realized he needed to see what stannis was doing and added davos after that he added a pov whenever the story called for it i guess but i doubt he would end the series with a pov he didnt even plan from the beginning by the way i found all this info in an ssm from or ill try to find it later edit i also doubt sam will write a song of ice and fire for the same reason instead i think itll be tyrion in his first appearance in jon hes heavily associated with songs and there are a few other such instances like in the season finale when tywin asks him if he wants to write a song for the dead starks and tyrion actually seems to consider it
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the ideal person for that would be aemon steelsong having become a bard like his father he enters the crossroads inn and meets a handful of characters that were forgotten along the road and at the end he plays the song of ice and fire
asoiaf,not_removed,its told a hundred or more years later by baby sam now the oldest person in the realm
asoiaf,not_removed,at least i will be able to handle that
asoiaf,not_removed,it has to be sam as grrm is closely mirroring himself in sam he writing about jon the legendthe song of ice and fire makes sense to end with him telling the tale to maybe a young grand grand child of jon
asoiaf,not_removed,if its an epilogue he has to diethats just how epilogues and prologues work
asoiaf,not_removed,it cant be sam i explained why above
asoiaf,not_removed,the legged ravenbran
asoiaf,not_removed,didnt old nan die at the dreadfort
asoiaf,not_removed,sansa dont think shell make it to the end
asoiaf,not_removed,and thus the series ends my lord ends my lord ends my lord
asoiaf,not_removed,four of his sons died on the blackwater devan is stannis squire the other two are with their mother on cape wrath
asoiaf,not_removed,combine this with the epilogue pov dying at the end tyrion gets the wish he made in game of thrones to die at in bed with a belly full of wine and a maidens mouth around his cock
asoiaf,not_removed,i want an epilouge in the future showing how the world adapts after the second long night is over bran might be best for that though now an old man one with the weirwood in the winterfell godswood watching over westeros through the nowregrown weirwoods imparting the history of the seven kingdoms to jons greatgreatgreatgreatgreat grandson in much the same way the threeeyed raven taught him a couple centuries before
asoiaf,not_removed,i think it will be bran but i dont think the long night will be over i think it will overtake everyone and everything and bran will simply be to bear witness to it
asoiaf,not_removed,a maidens cock around his mouth ftfy
asoiaf,not_removed,so we back to square one nice idea though
asoiaf,not_removed,but hes with the brotherhood in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,ouch too real man
asoiaf,not_removed,he watched a shadow demon come out of a womans vagina so hes got that going for him which is nice
asoiaf,not_removed,think op is letting tv series influence his post a bit
asoiaf,not_removed,he lost three sons at blackwater though didnt he thats a good bit of loss
asoiaf,not_removed,i like your arya into nymeria theory it would be just pleasant enough for arya to be happy and carefree which she hasnt been able to do since joffrey sansa showed up to her and mycah practicing on the trident
asoiaf,not_removed,he only has son but the younger ones are still alive as they where too young to go to war devan is hanging with mel and is a squire to stannis stannis and steffon seaworth are with their mother at cape wrath
asoiaf,not_removed,for all i know
asoiaf,not_removed,what makes you think they will all live in the end hrrrm i cant see sansa making it all the way through considering grrm said the main characters are jon bran arya tyrion and dany they are safe i think not sansa
asoiaf,not_removed,i really think dany and tyrion will both be dead before this
asoiaf,not_removed,just sansa dies im sorry but tyrion looks like more of a goner than sansa
asoiaf,not_removed,and he has to keep time and watch over shit for as long as long is until someone else comes along that can take his place bit of a bittersweet ending
asoiaf,not_removed,things change
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think george has necessarily decided who is going to end it just how
asoiaf,not_removed,i kinda want samwell and tyrion to write a book about everything ser piggy and the imp has a nice ring to it
asoiaf,not_removed,i love it
asoiaf,not_removed,its windhaven all over again
asoiaf,not_removed,i wont
asoiaf,not_removed,it has to be sam as grrm is closely mirroring himself in sam so sam will tell them that theres more to the tale but hell get around to telling it later
asoiaf,not_removed,samwell tarly is based on samwise gamgee samwell will write about jons adventures the same way samwise wrote about frodos
asoiaf,not_removed,your thoughts arent facts
asoiaf,not_removed,two scoops of ravens in every bowl or ravenbran
asoiaf,not_removed,branraven
asoiaf,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
asoiaf,not_removed,cool idea
asoiaf,not_removed,no i think grrm said the prisoners in the dreadfort were still alive
asoiaf,not_removed,the appendix says she is at the dreadfort someone thinks she is dead but nothing confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,why
asoiaf,not_removed,im worried for davos because his only son died in the show if his ending conisisted of going home to his family why would d d kill his whole family in the show precluding such an ending
asoiaf,not_removed,i wonder if aryas part in the end has been cut down a bit since george scrapped the love triangle idea other than killing important people i cant really see her part in the grand conclusion unless she assassinates the night king or something
asoiaf,not_removed,i think grrm changed his mind after and decided to give sansa a bigger role equal to that of the others shes probably doomed anyway though
asoiaf,not_removed,if anything being one of the main characters in the final book makes you way more likely to die id say the odds of arya getting a straight happy ending are about zero at this point bittersweet is the best were getting considering her character arc and foreshadowing straight tragic being possible as well dany too the books have made it clear shes an agent of chaos a conqueror fire and blood who at her best will save westeros but shes not a builder or maintainer postlong night unlike jon who seems being set for that role
asoiaf,not_removed,in that grrm wrote that those five central characters make it through to the end he could have of course changed his mind since then though
asoiaf,not_removed,uh oh that doesnt bode well for her betraying jon next season dammit sansa
asoiaf,not_removed,so just because theyre dead they cannot be point of view anymore no surprise that faced with such bigotry the others react with violence
asoiaf,not_removed,im not even convinced dany will make it to the end
asoiaf,not_removed,i think sansa does live its not like the stories where the maiden dies of a broken heart because blah blah blah she has to live the rest of her life remembering she caused a lot of people to die not just her father and probably her mom and brother but thousands and thousands of people died because she acted like a little girl and ran to cersei to tell her neds plans
asoiaf,not_removed,she hid the murder of lysa from all of the veil was an accomplice in framing the singer if shes becoming a major player i doubt shell tell anyone but i could see jon giving her a trial if he found out
asoiaf,not_removed,relevant line from agot here and now ser jorah agreed you ought to see it when it blooms all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon like a sea of blood come the dry season and the world turns the color of old bronze and this is only hranna child there are a hundred kinds of grass out there grasses as yellow as lemon and as dark as indigo blue grasses and orange grasses and grasses like rainbows down in the shadow lands beyond asshai they say there are oceans of ghost grass taller than a man on horseback with stalks as pale as milkglass it murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the damned the dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world and then all life will end that thought gave dany the shivers i dont want to talk about that now she said its so beautiful here i dont want to think about everything dying as you will khaleesi ser jorah said respectfully
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know she just strikes me as a doomed character as for tyrion i think hes either going to lose his tongue and write asoiaf or become the lord commander of the nights watch
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope youre joking tyrion has the most chapters in the entire series
asoiaf,not_removed,nice username
asoiaf,not_removed,dont go down this road man its a dead end
asoiaf,not_removed,you think grrm is that predictable
asoiaf,not_removed,but it is a fact he didnt intend for sam to be a pov from the beginning but hes always known the ending so yeah
asoiaf,not_removed,someone thinks she is dead but nothing confirmed pretty sure that someone is theon
asoiaf,not_removed,they killed every tyrell except olenna in the show but there are supposed to be more in highgarden dd dont care more about grrms planned fate of offscreen family members than the budget
asoiaf,not_removed,dd know the broad strokes of the ending but not every detail grrm may not even know but i dont hold out much hope for davos family the human heart in conflict with itself i predict davos is going to have to choose between saving them and serving stannis
asoiaf,not_removed,it dont work that way
asoiaf,not_removed,its difficult to see what she could do really at the same time she still has more pov chapters than dany so i dont doubt that she is crucial in some way its worth noting that when grrm was asked about if his major character arcs had changed over time the three he mentioned as being always the same in his head were jon arya and tyrion so i doubt her role has been significantly reduced at all im on mobile so i cant find the exact ssm right now
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm has said that for certain characters specifically arya tyrion and jon he always knew what their arc would be so i doubt so arya is the biggest female pov character and the only pov character to have chapters in every book so i doubt her role has been cut down
asoiaf,not_removed,no man can kill me im not a lady
asoiaf,not_removed,im pretty sure thats where shes going she needs to kill someone big or her whole training to be an assassin storyline is a colossal waste of time and space whos bigger than the night king i think she might be jons nissa nissa by the way i think nissa nissa is lightbringer note that you can make the word assassin from nissa nissa i think jon might kill her to make her undead or something and this will allow her to attack the night king by surprise and finish him off ending the war there is a lot of emphasis on her being able to fight in the dark and because shes also a warg shell be able to offset the night kings wargness then jon will have to become the new night king i made a post about this today tyrion wont know about this and this happens
asoiaf,not_removed,what was the love triangle idea
asoiaf,not_removed,id say killing important people could be huge in the grand scheme of things if she returns from bravoos able to infiltrate and eliminate the way she does lord frey in the show she potentially can help jonsansa danytyrion or whoever consolidate power without annihilating the human armies that could be vital to repelling the undead
asoiaf,not_removed,i think if arya survives her role will be minor in the end game and more about being a leader of the new way of westeros if the feudal systems are abandoned she was never interested in marrying a prince or any of the traditional things expected of a girlwoman but will have strong opinions on the way things should be and a powerful skillset and name to influence things
asoiaf,not_removed,true but you have to admit those notes are extremely interesting he said he was making shit up and he very well could have been but nonetheless it got me excited haha i want winds of winter now oh my
asoiaf,not_removed,so dany dies so she can save the world from the white walkers and jon is left to rule the kingdoms back to prosperity in a new age
asoiaf,not_removed,id say the odds of arya getting a straight happy ending at this point are about zero ftfy
asoiaf,not_removed,we can certainly hope not
asoiaf,not_removed,she will but she will become mad like her dad
asoiaf,not_removed,her mom and brother that was all rob really he betrayed his oath which during war is stupid so he got what was coming to him
asoiaf,not_removed,i rather think sansas knowledge of lfs murder of lysa and his involvement in a lot of other things will be the end of lf not sansa she has so much dirt on him and he lets her so close to himself that its a chekovs gun begging to be fired
asoiaf,not_removed,as you will khaleesi is another way of saying have it your way khaleesi
asoiaf,not_removed,that seems a little forced imo
asoiaf,not_removed,how does most chapterswill live if anything we have spent the most time with him and his story can wrap up quicker seriously this just baffles me
asoiaf,not_removed,yes rlj
asoiaf,not_removed,unless sam is tragically murdered i dont see how else it would go
asoiaf,not_removed,what how do you know grrm knows the exact final line of the entire series im sure he knows the ending in general but hes still got to write it it could definitely end with sam
asoiaf,not_removed,but they arent mutually exclusive
asoiaf,not_removed,you said yourself that hes added povs as needed as the series has progressed what he may have intended years ago has already spun into something completely different my guess is that he probably still doesnt know how hes going to go about ending the series but he knows how the story will end i dont think you can be certain about anything at this point and i think a sam ending chapter would be as or more likely that just anyone else
asoiaf,not_removed,he didnt intend for sam to be a pov and yet he is so even if he didnt or doesnt as of right now intend for sam to be the last pov he certainly could be i dont think it will be sam but your logic for why it wont be him is just so wrong
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought it was theon but i couldnt remember exactly makes sense it was theon
asoiaf,not_removed,davos is a main character and more important to the story if not westeros than the tyrells
asoiaf,not_removed,but they probably know davos ultimate fate so it wont end well for davos family in all likelihood
asoiaf,not_removed,what do you mean
asoiaf,not_removed,when grrm was asked about if his major character arcs had changed over time the three he mentioned as being always the same in his head were jon arya and tyrion jon and arya otp confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,note that you can make the word assassin from nissa nissa grrm please
asoiaf,not_removed,your theory is absolutely ludicrous have an upvote
asoiaf,not_removed,in grrms original outline there was eventually going to be a love triangle between jon arya and tyrion
asoiaf,not_removed,with tyrion as his hand
asoiaf,not_removed,i know but it could have a double meaning grrm might have tried to give us danys ultimate fate in this seemingly inconspicuous line but i dont believe it myself
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont believe it its just something i noticed and thought was worth mentioning
asoiaf,not_removed,i felt like such an idiot not picking up on all the blatant hints that he dropped throughout the series about that when i first read the books
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe sam will find some information in the citadel that ends up saving the world but dies before he learns his role in doing so it seems like the kind of thing grrm would do to a standin character hes got a twisted sense of humor after all
asoiaf,not_removed,whats not mutually exclusive
asoiaf,not_removed,hes said many times that the planned ending never changed youre just arguing for the sake of arguing
asoiaf,not_removed,grrms list of main characters doesnt include davos nor was his pov originally intended to be included in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,they removed loads of characters from the series or merged them that doesnt mean they die or arent important for the plot and they probably cba to mention his sons its such a minor part of everything like idk how to write my thoughts on this down maybe else can make it clearer
asoiaf,not_removed,i think he meant that his fully formed idea of their arcs came a bit after that given that the rest of tyrion and aryas stories are so different from the original outline but somebody pointed out some wierd stuff to me which looks worryingly close to foreshadowing that outcome if you read it with the outline in mind im still sure that its scrapped but some of the stuff in jons pov is really icky in that context
asoiaf,not_removed,guilty confession of the day i kinda ship jonarya
asoiaf,not_removed,assassin ni
asoiaf,not_removed,as opposed to time travel and having one of the biggest mysteries in the series be hold the door
asoiaf,not_removed,what part do you find ludicrous it all seems logical to me
asoiaf,not_removed,dany probably dies because of her obsessiveness with conquering and burning and i doubt its as gloriously as fighting the whitewalkers since two of her dragons are feral if i remember correctly and drogon listens to dany whenever he feels like it shell likely be killed by aegon in ironic fashion mimicking the way she watched viserys die or shell be roasted alive by one of her dragons as iirc she presumes the reason viserys died from molten gold was because he was not a dragon it would be even more ironic for her to die from flames from her own dragons or by accidentally lighting wildfire and realize that she herself was not a dragon all along or i might be completely wrong
asoiaf,not_removed,he said he always knew how it ends but never said anything about who tells that ending sam very well could be how he decides to tell the ending
asoiaf,not_removed,hes putting up at least as much good points to the contrary if hes pointlessly arguing so are you its just a discussion its alright for people to expect different ideas
asoiaf,not_removed,the ending might be the same but you could show that ending through a bunch of different characters povs as long as the character is alive at the end they could be a pov for the ending without having to change the ending
asoiaf,not_removed,youre just arguing for the sake of arguing im genuinely not i honestly disagree with your point wholeheartedly i promise
asoiaf,not_removed,i know but davos was the first pov to be introduced after the original povs at the time grrm did not have the tendency to introduce new povs willynilly so he would not have done it without thinking it through and knowing where the character was going
asoiaf,not_removed,i know what you mean but this is to do with davos ultimate fate and davos is a very important character in fact he was the first pov grrm introduced after the original ones from agot if we were to assume that davos ultimate fate consists of going home to his family why would d d kill them off right unless that isnt his ultimate fate and his family is doomed
asoiaf,not_removed,what kind of weird stuff do you mean
asoiaf,not_removed,you are not alone i was like aryajon are you crazy then i read this and my paper ship sailed
asoiaf,not_removed,i ship jonarya and i dont know why they just seem so awesome together
asoiaf,not_removed,the assassin of ni for when the knights dont cut it
asoiaf,not_removed,you can get in assassin from nissa nissa in assassin is kinda like an assassin so there hey i think i just realized why grrm hates harry potter he cant get over the fact that the i am lord voldemort twist was revealed all the way back in in chamber of secrets when he came up with a similar twist earlier but just didnt get to reveal it first
asoiaf,not_removed,having one of the biggest mysteries in the series be hold the door was it considered one of the biggest mysteries in the series i never once thought twice about it the dimwitted but loyal strong character is not exactly a new or unique idea
asoiaf,not_removed,its all in the execution
asoiaf,not_removed,the you can make assassin from nissa nissa is quite a stretch lets be honest ned stark can be turned into dark nets but that doesnt mean anything does it
asoiaf,not_removed,its not ludicrous i guess but arya becoming undead so she can slit the throat of the nights king seems a little silly dragons are coming seems like they are more of a threat to the walkers than lil arya stark could ever be dont get me wrong i dont have to believe in a theory to like it it is a neat theory
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt the identity of the pov a major part of how it ends you think he actually wrote agot and much of acok before going oh i know who to end the series with samwell tarly because let me tell you youre depreciating grrms talent
asoiaf,not_removed,hes overcomplicating things needlessly you could make the same arguments hes making for sam for anyone else
asoiaf,not_removed,you could say the same thing youre saying about sam about literally anyone else theres no point in overcomplicating things you could secondguess anything if you try hard enough
asoiaf,not_removed,i see what u mean but i just dont think they had the time to introduce his family his firstborn died the same way in acok as well how would his family die anyways theyre in an island probably unknown to most im not sure davos will return home in the end but i cant see his family dying
asoiaf,not_removed,its entirely possible that davos will die in the show and live and return to his family in the books im sure dd will keep the ultimate fates of the principle characters the same but i wouldnt count davos among them
asoiaf,not_removed,basically somebody tried to convince me that their romantic relationship hadnt been scrapped they had a load of other stuff which was a bit more vague and could well just be confirmation bias but these quotes in jons pov still felt a bit icky in the context its worth bearing in mind that none of this is from agot so theres no chance that any of this stuff is leftover foreshadowing from the original outline which he forgot to remove either she is no older than i am something about her made him think of arya though they looked nothing at all alike will you yield he asked giving the dirk a half turn and if she doesnt literally his first thought on meeting his future lover is on how similar she is to arya she reminded him a little of his sister arya though arya was younger and probably skinnier it was hard to tell how plump or thin ygritte might be with all the furs and skins she wore he then goes on to compare how her naked body might look to his year old sister wtf jon ygritte watched and said nothing she was older than hed thought at first jon realized maybe as old as twenty but short for her age bandylegged with a round face small hands and a pug nose her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions she looked plump as she crouched there but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather underneath all that she could be as skinny as arya he makes the same weird comparision here slightly more explicitly if anything if you kill a man and never mean t hes just as dead ygritte said stubbornly jon had never met anyone so stubborn except maybe for his little sister arya is she still my sister he wondered was she ever he compares ygritte to arya again before wondering if she was ever his sister for some reason she isnt but you definitely dont know any better who was he a boy at a feast five years past hed come trading with his brothers and he had hair like mine kissed by fire so i thought he would be lucky but he was weak when he came back t try and steal me longspear broke his arm and ran him off and he never tried again not once it wasnt longspear then jon was relieved he liked longspear with his homely face and friendly ways she punched him thats vile would you bed your sister longspears not your brother in this conversation with ygritte jon defends somebodies right to sleep with someone who they grew up with who isnt actually their sibling
asoiaf,not_removed,you must cut down the mightiest lord in westeros with a herring
asoiaf,not_removed,it was up there
asoiaf,not_removed,oh my god howland reed used nets to defeat arthur dayne it all makes sense now
asoiaf,not_removed,relax i was just being facetious
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah youre right people never modify there decisions after mulling it over for years
asoiaf,not_removed,he was planning a year gap after asos its not hard to believe he changed something like who gets pov in the last chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but thats what this post is about just fun ideas to pass the time
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly your point is that the ending has to be one of the original intended characters and at this point i think it could be literally anyone i dont think its restricted to them anymore thats the point that im trying to make that said i do think the story ending with sam as grand maester would be a fitting conclusion and could bump his chances at the final chapter but thats beside the point that im trying to make
asoiaf,not_removed,who knows how theyll die the story will sort itself out they dont have to introduce his family they can just offhandedly mention it from time to time and if they were absolutely central to davos ending i think d d wouldve taken the time to introduce them
asoiaf,not_removed,of course its possible im just saying his familys exclusion in the show makes it more likely that theyll die in the books not an absolute certainty
asoiaf,not_removed,i just honestly dont know what to think about this reading it in this context youre right its a bit icky
asoiaf,not_removed,i always found these quotes a little icky even before the original outline was published i mean jon clearly is attracted to a certain type of woman and that type is pretty much arya this one is especially odd if you kill a man and never mean t hes just as dead ygritte said stubbornly jon had never met anyone so stubborn except maybe for his little sister arya is she still my sister he wondered was she ever he compares ygritte to arya again before wondering if she was ever his sister for some reason she isnt but you definitely dont know any better it could be foreshadowing of his true parenting but its strange thought to suddenly have
asoiaf,not_removed,suddenly changing the ending which youve planted many clues for and seem to be building up to of a story youve been a writing for years is usually disastrous and a horrible idea
asoiaf,not_removed,hey its not hard to believe grrm has changed his mind about rlj because people figured it out hes obviously replaced jon with aegon
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think the epilogue if there is one will be from the pov of an established character
asoiaf,not_removed,for my it really its not that icky maybe because my parents have the same age gap than arya and jon
asoiaf,not_removed,its not the age difference its that shes a child there are years between me and my boyfriend but hes a legally consenting adult old enough to buy his own alcohol
asoiaf,not_removed,but she will grow up and if i can remember the lannister were only waiting for sansa to have her first period to marry her and raegar falled in love with lyanna when she was like years old
asoiaf,not_removed,yup and its all a bit icky to me im a history major so im well aware of historical practices and the like but im modern and it can still give me icky feelings
asoiaf,not_removed,the golden company has blackfyre
asoiaf,not_removed,what does honor even mean jaime skewers honor perfectly in his so many vows speech from the show one of its finer moments i hate this talk about neds perfect honor ned was basically kind of a dummy if hed been smart hed still be alive his kids would be safe thered be no war is it honorable to take a course of action you know will wind up killing and raping thousands of totally innocent people screw ned and his honor
asoiaf,not_removed,why would bran want to bring down the known world why would the others want to bring down the known world
asoiaf,not_removed,hodor
asoiaf,not_removed,the others obviously because that is why they were made as for bran no clue really
asoiaf,not_removed,thats not why they were made if you take show canon into account they were made as a tool for the cotf to use against the invaders that meant to harm them they just lost control they werent made to destroy the world
asoiaf,not_removed,there is a very big difference between defending the land beyond the wall and conquering the entire known world the others have never gone south of the wall and theyve had countless opportunities to invade the seven kingdoms conquering the known world seems very unlikely to be their agenda
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought op meant extincting humanity when he said bring down the known world my bad
asoiaf,not_removed,here comes what is predicted to be one of the harshest winters that westeros has supposedly seen in years it could be argued that an ultimate goal for the others would be removing man past the fingers the land past dorn that leads to essos if i remember
asoiaf,not_removed,hes martins take on jay gatsby
asoiaf,not_removed,we do have one for gregor he suffers from severe migraines most likely due to his giantism and you could argue that that joffreys cruelness and disregard for others is the result of being raised by cersei on lf maybe im forgetting something significant but from what i remember he had an unhealthy obsession with a girl who only considered him a friend never got over that and now wants to fill the hole in his heart by becoming the most powerful man in the world and fucking that girls underage daughter not really that sympathetic
asoiaf,not_removed,beginning with conspiring with lysa to murder jon arryn george consistently introduces characters or ideas that help us understand motives by showing us real time problems ex jon deciding to switch gilly and mances children to protect the baby parallels ned lying about jons parentage to protect him theon is intorduced as a ward who we then follow through his difficult decision making theon is used in a way for us to understand littlefinger littlefinger went though the same managerie was taken from home and plopped somewhere he didnt belong given a new family and expected to just get along with it well weve seen first hand what that does to someone it left theon without a family he could call his without an idea of where he was headed and also with a bloated sense of self littlefinger managed to turn this situation to his advantage he like theon had a brutal awakening one day which unlike theon gave him a startling realization that if he wanted something he needed to take it from more deserving hands hes painted to be the bad guy but you cant help but sympathise with him a little hes the cunning mouse playing the cats against one another to what you said about grey characters the same can be said about daenerys weve been rooting for her this entire time cheering at every small victory but in the end her character will be the villian the conqueror she is going to fuck up alot and were still going to root for her just think about that
asoiaf,not_removed,theres nothing grey about being selfcentered pretty sure thats as evil as you get even more evil is being a lying little cunt about it like lf is vs openly a dick like cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,id never considered that right on
asoiaf,not_removed,from the way ive read it cat didnt exactly help matters by being all flirty with young littlefinger now granted thats from lysas recollections so they could be biased it makes a bit more sense when you consider that lf probably believes hes had both tully girls maidenheads to me it only makes him slightly more sympathetic and definitely doesnt excuse his machinations but it makes him a bit more understandable
asoiaf,not_removed,even if cat was flirty this was decades ago lf not moving on is creepy at best
asoiaf,not_removed,oh definitely i didnt mean to say i was calling lf not creepy at all the way he acts towards sansa is textbook creeper behavior im just saying young cat maybe didnt help things not like she should have or could have known what unrequited feels would do to lf
asoiaf,not_removed,i feel like youre missing my point even if young cat got his hopes up over nothing the fact that lf still thinks about her at all is the issue
asoiaf,not_removed,i would imagine they paid the iron price for it
asoiaf,not_removed,they arent that poor they are still one of the major houses in the north theyre just poor when you compare lynesse hightower and her life in old town to her life on bear island oldtown is the richest city in westeros and bear island has no cities of any kind its just farms and stuff
asoiaf,not_removed,the mormonts may have been wealthier at some time in the past theres a passing reference to one of the stark kings winning bear island away from the ironborn and giving it to the mormonts so the mormonts may well have been refugees from someplace else like the manderlys originally were just less successfulfortunate in terms of their economic base
asoiaf,not_removed,since house mormont has had the blade for about five hundred years the exact circumstances of how they came into possession may have been lost to history that said the blades are rare but remain in the hundreds and we know that several minor houses possess valerian steel swords while in agot even a major one like house lannister does not
asoiaf,not_removed,almost certainly this the two ironborn vs swords that we know of were stolen not paid for with the gold price anyway the harlaws nightfall indeed taken from the deceased dalton greyjoy the mormonts gaining longclaw years ago very much places it in the ballpark of when rodrik stark gave them bear island the two most likely happened at the same time possible though very unlikely id bet the closest they ever came to a vs sword was being killed by it let alone escaping with it good question though i imagine it just stems from them not holding it throughout most of asoiaf it has become far more synonymous with jon owning it than the mormonts grrm has said its not
asoiaf,not_removed,more likely dark sister than blackfyre if its going to be a targ sword
asoiaf,not_removed,as did i
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think they were difficult to find or buy before the doom still rare awesome and noteworthy but not impossible
asoiaf,not_removed,i never question why any houses have valyrian steel swords since there are like valyrian steel swords in westeros a whole bunch of minor houses should have them we just never hear about them you dont have to be wealthy to own something incredibly valuable the mormonts and every other westerosi house with a valyrian steel sword could have gotten their sword in a number of random ways a mormont travels to essos their ship is attacked by pirates and one of the pirates has a valyrian steel sword a mormont saves some valyrian noblemans life and is rewarded with a valyrian steel sword a mormont marries a wealthy essosi family and they keep the sword a mormont just outright steals the sword from someone
asoiaf,not_removed,i asked the same question
asoiaf,not_removed,just found this the mormonts of bear island were an old house proud and honorable but their lands were cold and distant and poor ned stark
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its more likely they were previously a minor mountain clan along the shore of the bay of seals who upgraded to bear island for helping to rid the ironborn from the isle
asoiaf,not_removed,years is not that long in asoiaf or even in real life and the lannisters owned one but they lost it when king tommen lannister took it to valyria on his quest to find precious valyrian things after the doom
asoiaf,not_removed,now that you mentioned this did illyrio give blackfyre to aegon
asoiaf,not_removed,longclaw is a handandahalf bastard sword which jon has to wear over his shoulder as its too long on his hip whereas dark sister is only a longsword designed for a womans hand besides grrm has shot down the blackfyre longclaw theory but at least it is the right size
asoiaf,not_removed,s aeron mentions in the forsaken chapter that eurons valyrian steel armor would cost a kingdom even before the doom so naturally a sword wouldnt cost as much as armor but still it is too much for house mormont now i agree that they are not impossible but given its importance longclaw should have a backstory at least but when we come to this argument i have to become a supporter of the longclaw is blackfyre theories which i dont buy
asoiaf,not_removed,valyrian steel blades in westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,all those are a bit far fetched grrm could say what you said but we cant we cannot just make stories up how often is it that a poor lord or a lordling from a poor house goes to a different continent and comes upon a pirate who somehow stole a vs sword and then he doesnt die and ends up owning the sword the mormonts of bear island were an old house proud and honorable but their lands were cold and distant and poor ned stark
asoiaf,not_removed,thats when ned was comparing the mormonts to the hightowers no the mormonts arent rolling in dough but they are still a fairly major house in that they swear straight to the starks they arent super rich but they still have some power and some money
asoiaf,not_removed,i think thats a theory yeah blackfyre has been in essos since the rebellions if aegon is faegon then he might have it i dont know if its confirmed that illyrios gift is blackfyre dark sister on the other hand was bloodravens sword he may well have left it with aemon when he quit being lord commander and went north from the wall to become a magic tree man if longclaw isnt the mormont sword its probably dark sister the only source we have for longclaw being the mormont sword is jeor mormont the other mormonts dont mention it this doesnt confirm that its not longclaw obviously but it does leave room for a jeor aemon conspiracy to happen
asoiaf,not_removed,isnt the difference between a bastard sword and a longsword mostly in the hilt also i always took bastard swords to be smaller than longswords if anything hand and a half swords mean if youre using a two handed grip one hand will be around the pommel you can get a hand and a half on the handle this is in contrast to the two handed grip for longswords a longsword designed for a slight woman might look to be a bastard sword in the hands of big guys like mormont and jon even if the handle and pommel were more long sword than bastard sword originally jeor had it remade and possibly rebalanced with the white wolf pommel after the fire in his chambers the hip is the easiest place to draw a long sword from drawing a long blade from over your shoulder restricts the length you can draw by how far your hand can get from your shoulder in contrast to draw a long blade from your hip means the distance from shoulder to hand the distance from hip to shoulder if your blade is too long to wear at the hip because it hits the ground it would be unusable when slung over the back anyway youd just do this for carrying it without intending to use it if you mean to be able to use the sword youre wearing and its otherwise too long to wear at the hip you need to keep a hand on it to tilt it so it points behind you rather than down
asoiaf,not_removed,very true although that is including some number that have been lost and is almost certainly the upper limit indeed i would say for swords given by how few we know of the rest being various other smallerbladed weapons like lfs dagger likely the celtigar axe
asoiaf,not_removed,ahh thanks for the correction
asoiaf,not_removed,this theory has been around for quite a long time i find its rather convincing and i do feel its plausible but since all the other comments are posters praising it id just say some thoughts in dissent i oppose it firstly on principle asoiaf has become oversaturated with prophecies from quaithes glass candles to the undying to maggys valanqor to the targaryen ptwp to azor ahai in addition to mmds its going to be very tedious if each of those comes true which grrm has already assured us would not be the case he doesnt want prophecies to be too easy and too literal mmds prophecy if true would certainly be one of the more literal ones out there there are also some issues i take with the prophecy itself namely there is chronologically no time for this pregnancy to take place dany is a main character and her death in the show will therefore likely than not be the same as hers in the book there is no time for her to become pregnant and die on the birthing bed and as a dragonrider and a ruler shed be too busy to likely consider carrying out a pregnancy when she will likely fight the others the only way i can see this carry out is in a epilogue after a timeskip but killing off a main character in that fashion is a disservice to her character and rather amateur its not something i think grrm would do to one of the lead characters personally if dany was to die id like it to happen as of her own agency in battle or what have you another nitpick at this theory is that mmd says that drogo will return to her if she dies and meets him in the afterlife she would be returning to him instead it seems to me that mmds words were not a prophecy and instead just plain insults to rile dany up other mystics require blood as a criteria for prophesying and i just dont think mmd has the gift of prophecy
asoiaf,not_removed,the others have been defeated by jesus snow and his fellow dragon riders i think that the key to stopping the others being three dragons with three riders is going to turn out to be incredibly false actually and i almost want to do a write up on this i think there is something really peculiar about how unanimous the belief is that the end of the story will see daenerys as jons sidekick love interest pretty much all theories about the ending are centered around this idea that somehow jon will do something to save westeros and that dany will pitch in a little but also die
asoiaf,not_removed,sun rising in the west quentyn seas go dry dothraki crossing the sea mountains blowing in the wind the wall melting
asoiaf,not_removed,nicw write up and an interesting read do you think the child dany has would become the new leader of westeros or what is left of it
asoiaf,not_removed,plus daenerys is said to have a build like queen naerys who had great difficulty having children and herself died in childbirth plus a failed pregnancy so young can have long term negative side effects the idea of never being able to have children definitely shapes a lot of danys thoughts and choicessimilar to jon snows identity issues of being a bastard finding out shes pregnant could make her abandon whatever her current course is however i do think grrm plants a lot of seeds for the this will never happen to grow later on but has no intention of going through with them all i think its entirely possible dany never has a baby and the whole thing is a red herring i think its possible she gets pregnant interprets the prophecy as assuring the birth of the child and accidentally sacrifices herself thinking she will definitely survive because she is mislead by the prophecy i think dany has a huge problem thinking she is a special snowflake because of her dreams and these prophecies it think all this time whoever has been sending them is setting her up for a big fall getting herself good and killed
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree i dont see dany living till the end and her dying in childbirth also creates that bittersweet ending that george talked about it leaves some hope though that her child could grow up and help rebuild westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,not gonna lie had fun reading this thanks mon dont know if there is a name for the trope other than foreshadowing maybe you should name it the grrm trope of couldabeens shouldabeens and wouldabeens because the ouldabeen must ave three edds or some such not sure danys going to get back with her sun and stars think its way more likely shell get the son of stark another boy who died and came back and well all go oh yeah mirri maz was right all along
asoiaf,not_removed,some months ago i wrote up as well that i think dany will die of childbirth is bitter sweet enough for me its hopeful and sad at the same time it also brings to the world another motherless child just as her and jon and tyrion which for me are going to survive and end up in a way or another being father like feagures to this child just like ned did for jon
asoiaf,not_removed,its one of the most plausible candidates for bittersweet ending but its completely uninteresting in itself as arguably all small parts of a story when put in a vaccuum the question of whats gonna happen when danys gone is the interesting part if she ever sits the throne at all
asoiaf,not_removed,imo danys destiny is to break the wheel — the wheel of which she herself is an integral part this fits rather nicely
asoiaf,not_removed,well drogo has already returned to dany in the form of drogon at the end of adwd where they finally form a proper dragonrider bond and are therefore married looking at that i believe that people may be taking mirris statement a bit too literaly all it could mean is that she find a new metaphorical drogo or that she has hallucinations but ultimately survives take the show hotu people say that meeting drogo and rhaego means that she will die beyond the wall but the thing is that dany chooses to leave drogo and rhaego because her living dragon children call for her it could pretty much go either way
asoiaf,not_removed,first interesting train of thought second i somehow disagree with this grrm has again and again emphasized that prophecies should be taken with a pinch of salt besides dragon could be symbolically a targaryen not an actual dragon the dragon needs three heads could then mean a lot of different things a three blood sacrifices b three swords c three instruments the harp the horn and dawn swords i dont know maybe i am overthinking it i know i definitely overthink while rereading especially since i have found this community since old habits are hard to break i would love to understand the symbolism of the recurring number three great job and keep your theories coming
asoiaf,not_removed,i swear i read somewhere that there was foreshadowing dany would die in battle against the others but im drawing a blank
asoiaf,not_removed,awe i was hoping id be the first one on this but given the incredible amount of time the community has spent with the books im not at all surprised this theory predates me you raise some good points and ill see what i can do to offer some sort of argument against them yes asoiaf has been oversaturated with prophecy but i dont believe grrm when he says that not all the prophecies will be fulfilled the nature of prophecy allows with hindsight practically any event to be attributed to the prophecy you can kind of see that now with how many different possibilities are purposed for the same prophecies like i outlined in my write up there are many plausible events that could fit the sea going dry i suggested that it was either the end of the ironborn way something the show seems to be hinting at with yara wanting to change the ironborn as well as fitting to the grand and impending change dany alludes to in the show when saying she will break the wheel dead things coming out of the water at hardhorm or as another commenter mentioned it could also be the dothraki coming over the sea at the end of the series we are going to have to pick and choose which three fires dany has lit out of the many she has been involved with i chose the criteria that dany has to be in the flames for it to count thus excluding the fire at astapor and even the fire in the house of the undying since dany escapes before the flames would consume her even so im fitting the prophecy to fit my needs something im sure we will be able to do at the end of the series with practically every prophecy aside from a couple you raise a very good point about danys book fate being in line with her show fate while she easily has time to have a child over the course of the next couple books keep in mind we see lollys stokeworth go through a pregnancy beginning in acok and ending in affc her ability to do so in the show looks much less plausible and i agree that doing a time skip would be a disservice to her character though i dont rule that out as a possibility for the show that said maybe the pregnancy is magic we already have one potential jesus allegory running around so i wouldnt be surprised to see an immaculate conception show up in some shape or form and we have evidence supporting the idea of a sped up magic induced birth mel gives birth to a couple different shadow babies all within acok while the children were well shadow babies it does give grrm established wiggle room if he wants to rush dany through a pregnancy with the final point i think it is really how you interpret drogo will return to her i dont think grrm would do anything along the lines of the examples im going to purpose but i think they are reasonable ways you can explain away the specific use of language within the prophecy dany could enter the afterlife and see drogo riding a dope horse towards her ready to pick her up and carry her away it could also be a hallucination she has on her death bed seeing drogo come out of the light or something again dont see these happening i just think it shows you can find a way to get around the specific wording
asoiaf,not_removed,i for one would be really interested in reading that write up could never really get on board the whole three riders three dragons one enemy united they stand bleuuurgh or on board the jondany ship for that matter but sometimes in order to wreck da tropes you first needs to build da tropes it is in the deconstruction that these books come alive for me and that only works because the fundament is solid so actually i think what i am trying to say is if you have a narrative in mind that will fantalogically progress the story while avoiding these klichés i would love to read it
asoiaf,not_removed,the mountain being shattered to pieces by sandor
asoiaf,not_removed,i prefer the idea of seeing the wall being shattered and coming down in little pieces so it looks like a blizzard
asoiaf,not_removed,could it simply mean that when winter comes the seas will freeze and that will allow the dothraki to cross
asoiaf,not_removed,from the way that op wrote about danys possible death it certainly seems that way new heir her people
asoiaf,not_removed,tough to say but like uadymturrey said the way i wrote it certainly implies that i personally think grrm is moving the world towards a massive change in terms of hierarchy and structure a lot of what in my opinion the books are about are the inherit flaws with the patriarchy and critiquing feudalism the show reinforces the idea of a great change with the female allstar alliance yaras willingness to change the ironborns ways and dany saying she wants to break the wheel ie the system well i dont think grrm is going to have all the characters at the end of the series proclaim their love and want for a democratic system where everyone has equal rights and lives together in harmony i do think the system we are introduced to at the start of the novels is going to be very different to the system we get at the end personally i see us ending up with a more merit based rather than blood based system something like the great councils within the novels or the witan of anglosaxon england come to mind essentially looking at an elective monarchy where the kingdom decides the next ruler as a cohesive group and the elected ruler reigns until they pass away or are incapable of leading any more as another inuniverse example you need to look no further than the nights watch they elect a lord commander for life in fact jon snow in my mind is a pretty good example of what is to come for the kingdom he is elected to the nights watch based on his merit then if the show is to be believed he is essentially raised up by the lords of the vale and the north to be king again based on his merit more than anything quick note if jon becomes king in the books i expect robbs will to play a factor which kind of throws this whole progress system out the window so will danys child be heir in a way yes the child will not be made regent immediately and may have to wait until the passing of the ruler established at the end of asoiaf but i think the child will be heir to the targ legacy and a potential claimant come next election season if my theory is correct i see the child and the passing of its mother as a dawn of a new age dany represents the passing of the old world and the child would represent the birth of a new future
asoiaf,not_removed,well naerys survived birthing at least two sets of twins after the good maesters told her she would not survive another childbirth ive never got the impression that dany believes shes a special snowflake during her childhood she had nothing but her abusive brother and her royal ancestry and name but now she birthed the dragons she crossed the red waste she conquered cities as tyrion said yes she is proud but who would not be in her position does she really hype herself up over her dreams and prophecies she has no reason to since shes already doing exceptional things the part she mentions most often are the three betrayals hardly the most uplifting part of it all fandom tries way too hard to read haughtiness and selfishness into this girl that actively tries to improve lives of other people and whose uttermost hearts desire is to find home and family its damn disheartening
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope you are right im pretty antidany so if she forgets to put on her plot armor before going to battle the others i wont be too disappointed
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks my special little boygirl i assume the trope is chekovs something since it is very similar to the chekovs gun trope where you dont mention a gun unless you are going to use it with this version you dont mention that it is impossible to scale mt chekov unless someone in your series ends up scaling mt chekov
asoiaf,not_removed,cool can you link me id love to see how our write ups vary and if there was anything i missed
asoiaf,not_removed,how does she break the wheel if she births the targ heir sitting her dynasty back on the throne
asoiaf,not_removed,id love the jondany ship to happen only for jon to get whipped af and getting cucked on the regular by dany
asoiaf,not_removed,ive written things relating to this before but at some point ill probably do a full write up i dont so much have a problem with the jondany ship if we look at it as a calculated political marriage rather than a love marriage and also because i dont expect it to last my bigger issue is with how people presume that the jon dany ship really just means that dany becomes a footstool for jon jon gets a dragon jon gets more troops jon gets to become king without doing the violent work of conquest and then jon primarily deals with the others meanwhile danys role in stopping the others is secondary to jons but she is the one that dies anyways i realize that this theory has dany dying later in childbirth but the idea is similar in both cases the jonxdany ship is really about jon not dany i know this will be an unpopular thing to say but a lot of this has to do with male heroes like jon being easier to relate to by most of the male fandom than heroes like dany
asoiaf,not_removed,confirmed get hype
asoiaf,not_removed,with the sea frozen wouldnt it be an incredibly long travel with no water or food sources and with incredibly low temperatures especially for the dothraki i dont see them just causually going through wth it
asoiaf,not_removed,i have a hard time envisioning that the nights watch kinda works because it is a celibate order if we overlook such little things like osric stark being chosen at nine or jons elections being rigged in his favour by mormonts raven but once it should be applied to the central government i think it has to fail soon theres absolutely no guarantee that the family and the clique of the first elected ruler would be willing to relinquish the throne and it would either slip back to hereditary monarchy or the kingdom would fall apart in another civil war westeros has no precedent for it save the great council and the kingsmoot but in these cases the elected monarchs have always been followed by their relatives but even if it somehow survived each and every election would be like the choosing of a pope during the course of history little stability but a lot of scheming rigging backstabbing blackmailing etc would an oligarchy that elects a new monarch every generation truly be an improvement over a strong central monarchy
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry im late to this postcommenti just want to wholeheartedly agree with you this fandom tries way too hard to read haughtiness and selfishness into this girl that actively tries to improve lives of other people and whose uttermost hearts desire is to find home and family its damn disheartening it is damn disheartening i feel like it comes from a bunch of dudes thinking shes just a snotty bitch and a bit of a slut blah blah blah im the dragon blah blah blah i cant stand her did i say dudes i meant both sexes i just dont bet the hate it seems as if she was male she would get all the love i realize thats impossible to determine but some of the wording makes it clear how the individual making the comment feels sorry about the rant it just gets damn disheartening from time to time i am one male that is in danys corner and who hopes to see her win the game of thrones and dance to the song of ice and fire ew cheezy
asoiaf,not_removed,heh yeah i get the chekov thingy but if someone in a grrm book says they are going to go scale mt chekov theyll probably end up mounting che scaloppine or some such instead grrms chekov has this pseudohallucinatory side to it some out of focus quality that makes his chekov more like chekovs close but no cigar than chekovs gun but im sure youre right some pesky bastard probably named that already
asoiaf,not_removed,just a comment not as elaborate as yours
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah that makes no sense at all im sure i have a point not sure what it is
asoiaf,not_removed,yes i know you have written about this before thank you i would simply like to read your thoughts on the subject as a full write up if you find the time and if you think you could have some fun with it dont really think i have a problem with the jon dany ship i see it as something that will probably happen just have a hard time getting on board as the implications of that particular ship in the form it is being presented atm tends to waver towards fluff rather than substance and i have a hard time with the whole one kliché to bind them all fade out i agree wholehearted with your last sentence the heart of the matter is just that dany reduced to jons sidekick simply dont cut it for me neither
asoiaf,not_removed,never give up
asoiaf,not_removed,yes he would still betray robb theon was as good as a brother to robb however he would never be a stark theon is desperate to belong he belongs with the greyjoys but he does not love his family he merely wants them to accept and respect him by achieving something
asoiaf,not_removed,i think so robb would certainly have given him landmarried him into a land holding family if he won anyway also the acceptance wouldnt have been given by ned so i dont think it would have appeased his desire for a father figures approval
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think he would of when theon takes winterfell he refers to himself as prince of winterfell and is pretty confident he was heir to the iron islands i dont think robb giving him a small bit of land and a keep would of got theon who has always felt more a hostage than a stark to want to live in the north and give up the iron islands
asoiaf,not_removed,even if it did change his mind i doubt it would have prevented the greyjoy invasion the only difference i could see is winterfell getting spared and an actual battle taking place between an actual greyjoy army led by victarion at moat cailin and the returning northern army i still think the outcome for the north is the same though except instead of getting killed at the rw the northern forces now get crushed between the greyjoys and the lannisters
asoiaf,not_removed,theon has a great talent of turning every situation into dogshit hed have fucked up anyway
asoiaf,not_removed,theon did feel like a brother to robb the problem was that in the end he wanted respect maybe if robb named him hand of the king or something it would be different although that would be a poor idea on its own merits
asoiaf,not_removed,from the age of ten he thought hed inherit the iron islands i doubt hed have been satisfied with a small holdfast especially considering how much of an arrogant prick he was at the start of the books and thats not even going into his issues with belonging or not
asoiaf,not_removed,he probably wouldnt he betrayed robb because robb never showed his appreciation for theon
asoiaf,not_removed,interesting play i think robb would have granted this to him after the war but what could have prompted such an offer at that point this could be an underlooked mistake by the young wolf we know his mistake is trusting theon and we know its because they grew up like brothers but it would not have taken a genius to suggest he try and seal his loyalty in some way wild card promise sansa or arya but thats another story especially when cat speaks up and tells robb he is making a mistake he could have made an offer like that just for the sake of shutting up his mother it would be very interesting to see how theon would react if robb had made a gesture like that balon completely emasculates theon when he shows up and makes him doubt who is friends are if theon had just one more nudge from the starks maybe he says ned was more a father to me than you ever were and chucks him off that bridge himself hes already thinking it when he says balon abandoned his only son how much more would it have taken then he shows up at the red wedding just in time to get the army to pick up their swords and walk inside
asoiaf,not_removed,i am surprised that robb never told the freys that he wanted arya betrothed to theon
asoiaf,not_removed,because some holdfast is nothing compared to being lord of the iron islands theon is his fathers last surviving son there was no title in robbs power to grant that would come close to matching that
asoiaf,not_removed,theon loves his family it is they who do not love him with the exception of his sister
asoiaf,not_removed,and his mother and even his uncle damphir really the exception is balon who hates him
asoiaf,not_removed,do you notice theon rarely mentions pyke in his povs he left pyke when he about but he has blotted out most memory of his home his older brothers used to beat the hell out of him he recalls eurone menacing eye balon was certainly no positive father figure the greyjoys have an incredibly bad family dynamic the ceftjaw is the closest man to a father he knew on pyke theon claims neds great sword was always between them yet at winterfell he was happy and always smiling he is noted for this theons early childhood most have been a sad lonely time in comparison to winterfells friends and laughter
asoiaf,not_removed,then what about euron i dont know about you but i never got the feeling that he cared much for theon aside from him being a potential threat politically speaking obviously
asoiaf,not_removed,and bookdagmer cleftjaw who sees him like a son
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah very true about the cleftjaw theons smiling and how even the most solemn and serious of the greenland kingdoms was waaay better and brighter than his existence on pyke
asoiaf,not_removed,i doubt euron is even capable of feeling love hes killed like half his family already
asoiaf,not_removed,hes only a nuncle after all
asoiaf,not_removed,theon may value dagmer but hierarchically dagmer is so far below him so how much can that sate his need for approval
asoiaf,not_removed,the islands are a dreary place but the greyjoys are very screwed up and they are the real problem their family dynamic is severely twisted this is how theon remembers being beaten in winterfell i have climbed these steps a thousand times before as a boy he would run up descending he would take the steps three at a time leaping once he leapt right into old nan and knocked her to the floor that earned him the worst thrashing he ever had at winterfell though it was almost tender compared to the beatings his brothers used to give him back on pyke he and robb had fought many a heroic battle on these steps slashing at one another with wooden swords this is how theon views his uncle under it he wore a stained white leather eye patch that reminded theon of his uncle euron hed wanted to rip it off umbers face to make certain that underneath was only an empty socket not a black eye shining with malice we know euron is serial rapist of family members there is a chance he raped theon too it is sad and this cruel family is one of the reasons theon makes so many bad decisions he thinks all ironborn are as brutal and crazy as the greyjoys and he makes all kinds of stupid decisions because of this theons men expect him to issue orders and fight instead he wants to impress them so badly he goes overboard and becomes an irrational killer it did not win him respect it made him look like a weak leader trying to look strong all this stems from his desire to belong to crazy family
asoiaf,not_removed,he loves himself
asoiaf,not_removed,theon wants to feel loved and to belong all his life for feeling loved and to belong hierarchical status is not a necessary point
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i kind of get it im from the crazy family but im also an eldest sibling its a bit different for me i guess shit rolls down hill id imagine my younger brothers could relate a little better
asoiaf,not_removed,jon and cersei storylines wouldve been strange to just pick up years later the ww wouldnt wait years after the pace at which they started herding the wildlings also cerseis downward spiral would be weird to have taken years
asoiaf,not_removed,year gap if twow comes out next year
asoiaf,not_removed,why are you mixing a gap in the story with a gap in writing i just dont get it
asoiaf,not_removed,i sometims wonder if he tried to do a bridging book like a book which spans that year gap with say chapters for each character that sort of covers the things which happen over that time but then i really cant imagine being satisfied with that book
asoiaf,not_removed,potentially some postgap material definitely cropped up in affc cerseis arrest at the hands of the faith would have happened oncamera regardless not offscreen george even has littlefinger make a metacomment on that i thought itd take cersei five years to screw up but i guess not brienne likewise would have also spent years exploring westeros looking for sansa and arya and wed have joined her probably doing some of the same stuff as in her affc storyline before meeting up with stoneheart this was one of the key areas george struggled with trying to make it believable that brienne could spend five years on the road without finding any trace of arya or sansa jon and bran would have likely spend years in training or running things and wed have picked up with them likely not far off from where we did i dont think wed have joined jon just as he was being stabbed or even much before that story would have needed at least a good few chapters to build up before the betrayal the real issues with the gap i think came from aryas early stuff in braavos the endless politicking in meereen tyrions oncamera journey across essos and the events in dorne also the splitting up of the original onevolume affc superprologue and its divvying up between different characters that was a big mistake i feel once he decided to ditch the multipov prologue george should have exorcised the extra povs and stuck with a single pov in each locale victarion and arianne although maybe youd need an aeron pov for his wow sample chapter but that could have been the prologue instead but i think the biggest issue and this goes right back to asos and even elements of acok was his decision to massively expand the original pov cast which wasnt supposed to happen and to write in increasing amounts of detail having entire travelogue chapters for journeys hed have skipped over completely in agot where characters would set out on thousandmile journeys and then would be at their destinations in their next pov chapter the loss of that conciseness i think is a bigger root problem for everything that followed and seems to be inherent to epic fantasy tolkien and jordan also suffered from it
asoiaf,not_removed,i think youre right on some of that but the timeline has been switched around a lot and some of what happened in affc adwd would have been in the second arc of his original plan just at a wild guess most of the essosi storyline dany barristan victarion tyrion is close to the beginning with meereen being a new addition the southern storyline cersei jaime brienne arianne areoh maybe sam and joncon is in the middle though i suspect this timeline has been changed more than the others the northern storyline jon theon asha is probably nearing its end with the battle of winterfell jons assassination and resurrection being the climax though its possible the original plan put those in the middle with a climax involving resurrected jon coming south or something equally remarkable sansa is probably at the beginning of her storyline though i only say that because nothing has really happened i have no clue for arya bran or the ironborn i know the ironborn storyline cant be at the beginning because plenty has happened involving characters who basically werent there in the first three books im just not sure what eurons endgame is going to be for this arc or how close it is my guess is that the storylines that are near the end of where they would have been in his original plan will move slower and those at the beginning will move faster so that by the end of twow well be about where he wanted to be after the second book back when he thought this would be a trilogy
asoiaf,not_removed,the way grrm set up the series with the constant reminder that winter is coming puts a time restraint on the entire story if after the events in asos there was a year gap and we were reintroduced to our characters and what theyve been doing and then jon snow mentions the numbers of ww has been increasing because winter is coming then that mightve been made the story flow better
asoiaf,not_removed,the year gap sounds like a very clumsy solution and i can certainly see why dropping it seemed like the best idea at the time however in hindsight considering how much grrm has struggled to bridge that gap in the last years he has produced essentially one book in two halves he should probably have gone through with it he certainly couldnt be in a worse position when it comes to the chance of ever finishing the series
asoiaf,not_removed,something someone has suggested is to have an interquel book a shorter book between books and that covers the fiveyear gap by fastforwarding between chapters chapters in the main series are either immediately sequential eg in agot daenerys viii occurs immediately after danerys vii or skip a short time like a few days or weeks tops this would be different with chapters being more like snapshots of the characters life during the fiveyear gap the trainees arya sansa sam bran would probably just get one or two chapters discussing their training the flashbacks theon had in adwd would be covered here in a few chapters we dont really need a detailed account of him being tortured despite what season did since cersei had six or so different hands over five years it would be hilarious if her story were told in six chapters each having a different hand as pov they would mostly be pov cameras though of course you could alternatively just have the moral usual approach with cersei as pov it ultimately doesnt matter the point is to just cover the period and fastforward during the gap jon and dany would be similar a couple of chapters speeding through their early blunders in the nights watch and meereen jaime would spend the gap cleaning up the riverlands and reestablishing lannister dominance while brienne would be looking for a highborn maid of fair face and auburn hair eg doing nothing but thinking shes accomplish great heroic things this only fails for two characters tyrion and stannis told via davos tyrions problem is that its absurd for his journey to meereen to last five years and its even more bizarre for stannis to just sit around in the north doing nothing for five years you would really need to rework their storylines a bit which i think its totally doable
asoiaf,not_removed,large parts of adwd are indeed part of the gapfilling affc adwd is a bit of a mix between gap material and postgap material and much of what was originally intended for adwd will be in twow in addition danys second to last chapter in adwd daznaks pit was originally going to be her opening chapter after the year gap therefore her opening chapter in twow would have been her third chapter after the gap daznaks pit and brownwater being her first two chapters iirc maybe i dont she wasnt supposed to leave meereen in this chapter her story would have picked up before her marriage to hizdahr now i know grrm has said that the two most difficult pov characters to work out the gap for were cersei and jon however i think even their openings in twow could have sufficed for after the gap for example cersei i in twow will likely be her discovery of kevans death she would grow more suspicious of both the tyrells and tyrion and increase protection of tommen varys murder of kevan could have actually been moved to the prologue of twow and we as readers would find out who aegon is in a later chapter as for jon if his murder were moved to the beginning of twow then the rest of the novel would be equivalent to where we are now i dont think that would have worked i cant imagine that this is what grrm had in mind cerseis shaming and jons death would have certainly been part of the original adwd if i had to make a guess about where their storylines would have picked up id say the moment when stannis leaves castle black for jon and tommens wedding for cersei however theres much that happens after the respective chapters that probably wouldnt have been part of the old adwd im not sure about tyrion but i agree with you on the other characters
asoiaf,not_removed,it looks like he knew where he wanted to go in the first act but not past that if thats the case he was probably going to slow down regardless
asoiaf,not_removed,subtitle of this post wow essentially nothing happened with any of the main characters from the first three books in affc or adwd did it the assertion is fairly hyperbolic in my opinion but i absolutely empathize with the feeling
asoiaf,not_removed,op this is an excellent point and really confirms the degree to which grrm has gotten lost in the weeds i still like affc and adwd dont get me wrong but i think this might be a case where the author failed to kill his darlings yknow eta i mean say with tyrions wallowing in depression its all good but plotwise do we need it or can we just see him five years later with scars on his wrists and figure it out
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope martin could include the gap mostly because of how many characters are way too young but the story is way to hectic to just be left unseen for years there is no way we can assume nothing happened to anyone in years
asoiaf,not_removed,affc and adwd takes place in less than a year so the year gap definitely has been scrapped for example the twow theon sample chapter is only months after the last few chapters of asos
asoiaf,not_removed,the bards will sing forever of a day of awful slaughter and so shall men remember the battle of brownwater
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm i am a gardener godammit
asoiaf,not_removed,the original outline for the entire original three book series including what happens after the five year gap who lives who dies etc has been around framed on his publishers office wall for two decades and has been on the internet for a couple years now i wont post it for spoilers but heres the link httpsasoiafquoracomtheoriginaloutlineofasongoficeandfire
asoiaf,not_removed,yes for cersei but jon was never going to die in that five year gap grrm other characters it didnt work at all im writing the cersei chapters in kings landing and saying well yeah in five years six different guys have served as hand and there was this conspiracy four years ago and this thing happened three years ago and im presenting all of this in flashbacks and that wasnt working the other alternative was nothing happened in those five years which seemed anticlimactic the jon snow stuff was even worse because at the end of storm he gets elected lord commander im picking up there and writing well five years ago i was elected lord commander nothing much has happened since then but now things are starting to happen again i finally after a year said i cant make this work
asoiaf,not_removed,wouldnt they if they cant pass the wall theyd need to wait for that to change they could be set toward any number of purposes in that time digging up ancient graves for example or even just laying in wait outside the tec cave if he has whats required for passage and honestly cerseis downward spiral happens unnaturally quickly as it is which martin even comments on in the text via littlefinger for example she manages to reconstitute an entire navy and lose control of it to some unknown bastard nobody who goes from attending a party to conjuring a fully loyalist fully capable marine corps out of thin air in the span of like a month ignoring the time it would take to actually build the fleet the process of reorganizing a state military around a cult of personality takes years normally even decades in affc this happens in what seems like weeks i mean its funny how bad this backfires but it would never happen this way someone would just stab mr waters in the back in the middle of the night somewhere along the way what he asks them to do violates their oaths is punishable by hangingdrowning and the orders are coming out of nowhere at the behest of a nobody they barely know who has no clear powerbase apart from the strangers hes giving illegaldangerous orders to but over five years over five years he can cobble together that many loyalists and that much support what he did is not impossible in a medieval state it just couldnt be done between august and october of the same year by someone like him
asoiaf,not_removed,im writing the cersei chapters in kings landing and saying well yeah in five years six different guys have served as hand and there was this conspiracy four years ago and this thing happened three years ago and im presenting all of this in flashbacks and that wasnt working the other alternative was nothing happened in those five years which seemed anticlimactic well we didnt get all the details of everything that happened during roberts reign and somehow that seemed okay actually thinking about it heres some suggestions if youll indulge me jon his first big act as lord commander is to order the rescue of some wildlings a la hardhome but its a disaster and he loses most of his rangers he thus loses all political clout and is forced to acquiesce to freezing shut the tunnel at castle black it takes him five years to regain that political clout by training up new recruits and making rangers out of some small number of wildlings moving much more slowly than he has in that regard the wildlings are scattered and disorganised and the watchs ability to range north is severely compromised but bits of info are getting thru and jon has found out that tormund has a small settlement somewhere thats the five year gap dealt with i reckon small problem the time jump would have to happen a few chapters in wed need to deal with jons first big mistake stannis settling at the nightfort the burning of rattleshirt etc before making the jump cersei this is a piece of piss just introduce a new character dont show us anything from cerseis perspective for a while instead show us things from the perspective of lord huffington wigglebottom the brand new hand of the queen or master of coin hes a naif in way over his head and he can be our entry point into learning about cerseis madness and stupidity plus he can bring us up to speed on any of her mistakes hes learning it for the first time so it wont seem like a flashback or an exposition dump we can even make a mystery out of it as he tries to discover why the crown has no money and what exactly happened to the last hand why hasnt he been seen since retiring because hes chained up in a dungeon getting turned into frankensteins monster thats why id cut the prophecy angle entirely cersei doesnt need supernatural prodding to commit murder
asoiaf,not_removed,helping the wall negotiating with the iron bank saving deepwood motte defeating ironborn recruiting wildlings northern allies and essos sellswords
asoiaf,not_removed,wander around while grinding his teeth obviously
asoiaf,not_removed,he can die during the gap and it be covered in a flashback which were supposed to be plentiful
asoiaf,not_removed,go to northosnortheros and recruit sellswords acclimated to fighting in wintery conditions
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i was confused i was like where the hell is he getting a year gap from
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah im not quite sure what hes getting at there
asoiaf,not_removed,something someone has suggested is to have an interquel book a shorter book between books and that covers the fiveyear gap by fastforwarding between chapters this is exactly what affc was intended for
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrions issue can easily be solved by having him stay with aegon for the most part of the gap while hes groomed for ruling and then having the party decide to leave to meet dany only at the very end of the gap
asoiaf,not_removed,the poop chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,dany shitting her guts out with drogon at the end of adwd
asoiaf,not_removed,gotten lost in the weeds i like what you did there because grrm considers himself a farmer so he got himself lost in his own crops
asoiaf,not_removed,you can have it off screen and just be vague like how empire strikes back yadda yadda yaddad several years but grrm loves giving a lot of exposition i dont think hed like doing it that way the real mistake was striking only part of the gap he sent people on their way to big gap stuff at the end of asos and early arcadwd dany shouldnt have stayed in mireen ayra shouldnt have been sent to essos sam should have stayed at the wall i feel like grrm came up with story for the five year gap but didnt scrap it all when he couldnt make it work
asoiaf,not_removed,the timespan of years for after asos definitely bit the dust a long time ago george wanted to age the characters up but around the time affc came out out he said if a has to save the world so be it
asoiaf,not_removed,i never said he was going to die in that year gap though
asoiaf,not_removed,i was really disappointed when i finished the series up to whats been released and the lannisters held the thrown the entire time martin said multiple people will sit the iron throne which has technically been true but i was really looking forward to the war of the five kings not being as one sided and lasting longer than it ended up being
asoiaf,not_removed,um she doesnt really rebuild the navy she builds dromonds in months and his sailors are all made up of criminals that they took out of the dungeons they have no real loyalty to the iron throne that imprisoned them which makes their turn to piracy make sense
asoiaf,not_removed,thing is there are a couple of vital actors who arent going to simply sit still during this gap namely stannis and the others stannis as we know goes to work immediately to make his situation in the north more tenable as the boltons are going to be coming for him eventually simply put the stannisbolton conflict must logically be resolved quickly as either side is compelled towards doing so telling the story of this confrontation in flashbacks would be incredibly anticlimactic especially considering how much effort grrm has put into characterizing both stannis and roose by asos the others pretty much go without mention throughout asos its abundantly clear that theyre becoming more aggressive from attacking the fotfm to harrying the rearguard of mance rayders humongous army asos ends with the wildling host being smashed and scattered to the winds becoming easy prey to the undead war machine for example see the adwd prologue even if jon seals the gates with ice and shuts his ears to the wildling cries for help the others will gain the momentum to attack well before five years pass
asoiaf,not_removed,it would be ridiculous for stannis to be hanging around the north for five years without anything having happened with the boltons
asoiaf,not_removed,theres no way grrm was going to do that since he had an arc for stannis in mind since acok a year timeskip where someone reminisces about that time stannis burned his daughter and then died would be anticlimatic even a flashback wouldnt be able to do it justice
asoiaf,not_removed,did you just advocate for stannis to die an off screen death
asoiaf,not_removed,essentially i think the point is in an effort to avoid a time skip martin made the writing needlessly more complicated accomplishing very little of interest and has made wait for the book longer the events that are happening now would make more sense after the gap and it would have been easier to write thus wed already have twow right now but we dont for pretty much no reason not sure if i agree but i can kind of see the logic behind i was never in favor of avoiding the timeskip myself
asoiaf,not_removed,and instead it became a lazilypaced travelogue that ballooned into two books pages and still isnt done as adwd cut off well before it was intended to really well done there george might want to stop telling your editor stet every time she makes a suggestion
asoiaf,not_removed,its a shame that thats the main thing people seem to remember about that chapter its the best chapter in the book it was really cool to see dany having her lil delirious vision quest and remembering who she is
asoiaf,not_removed,record scratch freeze frame well youre probably wondering how a guy like me ended up being the lord commander of the nights watch it all started when my friend sam
asoiaf,not_removed,i didnt say you did just pointing out that jons story was changed by grrm to make it a lot more interesting as originally nothing much had happened for him
asoiaf,not_removed,the oarsmen are criminals dromonds are mostly oar driven
asoiaf,not_removed,once they navy is stolen these criminals need waters forwhat theyre loyal to himwhy and they all happen to be sailorsfor some reason sorry this whole thing doesnt work for me
asoiaf,not_removed,well we dont know nothin about the others whats motivating them or what their timeframe is apparently theyve been doing nothing for years so more isnt gonna hurt as for stannis strap in folks its a long one well look ive been thinking a lot about this gap and ive reached two conclusions five years is probably too long at the end of asos lots of the characters arent where they need to be to make a timeskip work stannis is a great example youre right he tries to keep the momentum going so what wed need to do between the end of asos and the timeskip is to create some sort of terrible setback for him lets have him lose a battle and enough of his forces including davos apparently dead that hes forced into a holding pattern stuck waiting at the nightfort maybe hes even forced to retreat across the narrow sea despite his fierce opposition to such i think the best way to make something like this work is to have balon greyjoy still be alive and the ironborn invasion still going strong the situation would be thus cersei is unwilling to aid the boltons because shes a douche she thinks the boltons ought to prove their ability to hold the north by expelling the ironborn and stannis further she hopes that fake arya could yet be married to a lannister fulfilling tywins plans balon greyjoy is crippled weakened but alive and the ironborn invasion continues apace however hes not quite all there anymore and any strategic boldness he mightve had is gone still with him alive noone is willing to supplant him and take the lead so they more or less stay put they continue to hold moat cailin with the greatest of their number and for some reason little interference from the reeds and they have a tenuous grasp on much of the west coast the territory held ebbs and flows a bit over the years but mostly stays the same this causes some depopulation with refugees heading east mostly to white harbour perhaps at one point they sail round westeros and menace the east coast but its just harassment not a fullscale invasion roose bolton holds winterfell in his name but is mostly concerned with keeping it and the dreadfort he cant bring up a huge host the ironborn hold on moat cailin is too strong for anything but an allout assault with all of his number but to do so hed have to leave winterfell vulnerable to stannis or the ironborn the same logic affects his willingness to march west hes reluctant to use theon as a bargaining chip because ramsay cut his dick off plus its not just stannis and the ironborn he has to worry about wyman manderly has had his hostages released to him after he executed davos and roose trusts him about as far as he can throw him still the longer he holds winterfell and rules as warden of the north the more legitimate he looks stannis meanwhile follows jon snows advice and recruits the mountain clans and marches southwest to attack the ironborn at deepwood motte but disaster strikes somehow or other and hes forced to retreat the long march back north is struck by frost and he loses a lot of men he settles somewhere either among the mountain clans or at the nightfort hes lost some faith in melisandre knowing that balon didnt die per the trick with the leeches hes sent feelers out over the narrow sea to sellsword companies but hes been rebuffed theres plenty of work to be had with definite paychecks and words gotten round that salladoor saan has had nothing but bad things to say about stannis hes reduced to trying to negotiate with the north except bolton and the ironborn but he doesnt get anywhere except for a little bit with asha but the more he negotiates with her the more upset the mountain clans get finally he starts turning his attention back to the wall pressuring jon into opening up the gate again jon by now has some new recruits loyal to him and is able to resist the pressure from bowen marsh this however is alarming to bowen marsh and kings landing too is stannis taking over the watch thus we have stalemate in the north and apart from harassing each other and perhaps one or two big but failed attacks they end up where they started the ironborn hold moat cailin and the west coast stannis has his men the mountain clans and nominally the karstarks and half the umbers roose bolton holds winterfell and everywhere else but fears conspiracy especially from the manderlys bear island and the reeds remain defiant the catalyst for change is balon greyjoys eventual death and eurons return both happening around the same time and causing aeron to call a kingsmoot victarion leaves a small garrison at moat cailin and takes the bulk of his men back to pyke to challenge euron asha does the same for deepwood motte possible difference asha gives herself up to stannis after the kingsmoot per their negotiations he still threatens to burn her though this creates an opening for roose to retake moat cailin either by force or with theon and now theres a kingsmoot and division in the iron isles theon became so valuable that roose is willing to risk discovery that hes been horribly mutilated thus he can get frey reinforcements stannis meanwhile has capitalised on the same thing he gets asha and deepwood motte and perhaps wins some other battle against the ironborn knowing that rooses offensive capabilities have headed south to moat cailin and hes free to maneouvre roose is happy to let him because hes bought the karstarks and so expects to be able to defeat stannis with euron king the ironborn drop the north like a hot potato and now with stannis able to threaten to boltons directly cersei is finally prevailed upon to help which she does by sending roose arya thus roose brings theon out of the basement to negotiate the surrender at moat cailin and to witness faryas marriage etc etc i think ive covered everything oh davos is still alive and has been reading lots of books in the wolfs den jail all this time manderlys been keeping him on ice in case stannis wins or in case it becomes possible to openly defy the lannisters and boltons eventually however he finds out about rickon although not from wex and sends davos on his way we are more or less just dividing the affcadwd plot in two with a gap of unspecified length in the middle i think it could work brb writing a pirate cover version of asoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,thats probably one of the reasons that grrm scrapped the gap
asoiaf,not_removed,sure there could be some skirmishes but stannis may have other things to be doing in the mean time instead of a banker travelling all the way to stannis and giving him a free gift he could have had actual back and forth with the iron bank as he negotiated an amount of money much more time could have been spent with the castles of the watch being manned and refortified for the first time in centuries as well as policing the various factions in these new castles he could also have focused on what was behind the wall for some time or the wildlings could have taken a lot longer to submit than they did in affc and adwd resulting in stannis and his military to stay back to protect mankind the wall goes through an awful lot of change in months in affc and adwd those changes could have and probably should have taken longer
asoiaf,not_removed,heres a solution rumours of balon greyjoys death were false and the war with the ironborn is still in full swing stannis gets his arse kicked at some point and his wildlings proved faithless and he doesnt have the support of the iron bank because cersei hasnt fucked up yet the ib still hold moat cailin maybe and much of the west of the north but roose bolton holds winterfell and the east but barely the ironborn cant penetrate further east roose cant get the freys north without taking moat cailin the threat of the ironborn is the only thing keeping rooses coalition together maybe he doesnt have fake arya stannis has to retreat to braavos theres ways to make it work
asoiaf,not_removed,not offscreen the flashbacks were supposed to be expensive and detailed not some character just reminiscing or something similar
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think its so much that the shitting is the only thing people remember so much that its the fact that shitting her guts out is a pretty unique thing for any main character excluding tywin to do kinda like fat pink mast or something you cant really say its that chapter where she defined herself or something because she spent the entire book trying to do that
asoiaf,not_removed,dont forget her inability to make a hat
asoiaf,not_removed,all my life i knew i wanted to be a wizard
asoiaf,not_removed,right and in addition to that aurane captains the ships with younger guys of dubious loyalty despite pycelles suggestion that they crew them with experienced loyal men that fought for them at the bw
asoiaf,not_removed,well theyre not sailors i misspoke he makes the criminal oarsmen and he captains the ships with young men that are loyal to him not cersei against pycelles advice who suggests to captain them with experienced men who have proven their loyalty to them at the blackwater
asoiaf,not_removed,must i forever beee a beggaarrrr
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly why are they loyal to him
asoiaf,not_removed,first enslaved oarsmen would have a really really shitty life i know they technically arent slaves they are criminals put to work but for all intents and purposes they are slaves forced to do extremely hard labor so they are already in a shitty situation and would be predisposed to change i imagine waters probably made them an offer they cant commandeer the ships by themselves since they are just oarsmen and not sailors they fleet really needs waters and his inner circle to sail they could of course try to flee to shore but then they are fugitives and waters has no reason to protect them waters probably offered them the chance to be pirates and negotiated improved working conditions plus splitting the booty furthermore while they would still become fugitives they are in a much better position to evade the crown as part of a pirate fleet
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah im not saying its implausible just that its more plausible the longer hes there remember any one of them could sell him out for some decent money or favours from the crown
asoiaf,not_removed,they could do though it is unlikely that aurane is alone he would have his own entourage with him likely men he knew in the city or grew up with at driftmark who hed give positions of command in his fleet unless these criminals were super organized it is unlikely any of them would outnumber auranes own men and the prisoners who would be grateful and loyal to him for their release
asoiaf,not_removed,utter nonsense to end end any socialeconomic system it takes far more if it is to bloodless it takes time for the classes to adjust things break down when you break systems it takes time to put new systems in place dany is talking crap for show watchers any time you break any system quickly there are massive consequences
asoiaf,not_removed,its the show you cant make sense of it this is the same show where a girl gets stabbed in her vital organs swims a couple miles in a polluted river and then gets healed by soup especially if its something they said once and probably the only reason they did it was so it could get in the trailer and get peoples hopes up
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its meant to imply she is going to establish a frenchstyle absolutist monarchy by passing similar reforms as henry tudor no doubt these sorts of reforms men like littlefinger would favor high lord would lose a lot of power and be more dependent on the crown
asoiaf,not_removed,imagine her agreement with yara multiplied she will rely on the houses to enforce the new order they will support her to keep their lives and power
asoiaf,not_removed,she should have learnt that from her time in meereen
asoiaf,not_removed,a girl gets stabbed in her vital organs swims a couple miles in a polluted river and then gets healed by soup but you do have a point the suspension of disbelief in the show sometimes is rather far stretched
asoiaf,not_removed,i always just figured that maybe they were way more limited than she gave the impression like later in the books when she talks about keeping up the illusion that the magic is effortless so that it seems more impressive maybe the talk of stannis and his low burning fires is just a cover or maybe the range is limited or you need may more conditions need to align for them to happen if they do come up again my personal hope is that is countered in a way that makes it feel a bit less like a free kill like if one did go after euron but was unable to get through his armour or was turned away by some kind of counter id be a bit gutted if i read another chapter where a shadow appears out of nowhere and kills someone as important as euron
asoiaf,not_removed,i like this i can see stannis sacrificing himself to shadow kill euron cause i dont really see another way of him going down
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope the shadow babies will be like the time turners in harry potter an deus ex machina plot device that grrm realizes will be lame if overused
asoiaf,not_removed,wouldnt killing euron by shadow baby be a bit anticlimactic
asoiaf,not_removed,who do you think will be her shadow babydaddy
asoiaf,not_removed,nah theyve served their purpose the shadow babies can keep sleeping
asoiaf,not_removed,arya
asoiaf,not_removed,i think it will not as long as its done by a character that abhors the act it will be climactic in terms of character development
asoiaf,not_removed,i suspect jon but it can also be someone else regardless of the character i am sure fathering a shadow will be a very tough decision for him
asoiaf,not_removed,but also it means that aegons existence was completely pointless and only served to waste time
asoiaf,not_removed,prob to kill mance
asoiaf,not_removed,to be honest i cant see how these two are connected
asoiaf,not_removed,why to kill mance he is trying to save arya
asoiaf,not_removed,im not sure either im very exhausted right now and im not quite sure what i meant im sorry about that
asoiaf,not_removed,farya if im not mistaken i think mance has some ulterior motives that are a little devious hes in winterfell and will maybe have a good opportunity to size control of it while stannis and bolton fight it out also i think jon kind of likes mance at least respects him so it would be bittersweet for him
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree but theres still no reason to send a shadow baby after him
asoiaf,not_removed,mance isnt going to take control of winterfell with just himself and six spearwives also iirc those spearwives helped theon and farya escape and sort of got caught the one part of ramsays letter i have no trouble believing is that he put mance in a cage with the skins of the spearwives
asoiaf,not_removed,i dunno he was the first one that popped into my mind for a shadow baby kill who else is there that would be worthwhile if its jons shadow baby
asoiaf,not_removed,ramsay or roose
asoiaf,not_removed,i might be completely wrong but doesnt she need kings blood for shadow babies
asoiaf,not_removed,but if rlj
asoiaf,not_removed,the only real clue is that stannis flames burn too low to do it again it seems like mel made the demon with a bit of stannis life
asoiaf,not_removed,just found this video series where this guy muses on various hypotheticals seems like a fun way to pass the time during the off season its crazy how much i feel this would change certainly the vale joins robb no arming of the mountain clans to distract vale lords and presumably tywin would demand them all dead anyway so lfs plan is fucked dorne stays neutral presumably without the marriage alliance so stannis can take more men from storm lords unconcerned by the threat of dornish attack no wildfire and no chain means stannis navy survives the blackwater at least the whole renlys ghost thing may have caused his men to break who knows but his scouts would have ided tywin sans clansmen he doubtless would have taken the city at least briefly meaning no more joffrey myrcella and cersei dead sansa too unless the hound saves her tywin may have been able to drive him out and would still have tommen but if stannis escaped with a larger force he maybe could have allied with dorne robb and the vale and tried again later also with no tyrion cat never frees jamie meaning tywin may have had to sue for peace and grant northern independence at least for the winter hard to say if tywin would still die perhaps via oberyn as so much would be different also aegon and dany presumably marry all but guaranteeing targaryen independence i hate to say it but it seems to me things may have been better off if tyrion bit the dust
asoiaf,not_removed,aemon the dragon knight said theres no finer swordsman than cregan stark cregan should be in top
asoiaf,not_removed,robert baratheon he is the man to lead a van daemon blackfyre selmy arthur dayne dragon knight cregan stark kingslayer gwayne corbray daemon targ the mountain robar royce ii dunk the lunk roddy the ruin quentyn ball oberyn martell
asoiaf,not_removed,ultimately i maintain that robert baratheon was the greatest warrior maybe even including dayne and selmy he was a powerhouse and his warhammer gives him a particular advantage when concerning plate armor hes also got the kill count to back that up
asoiaf,not_removed,theon stark rodrik stark eddard stark no duncan qhorin mance
asoiaf,not_removed,id put sandor way higher and bronn really should be atleast in the top the hound is an absolute beast he fucked up beric dondarrion and won the tourney of the hand he fought his brother at the tourney of the hand all the evidence points to him him being way to strong and fast id put him top for sure
asoiaf,not_removed,i think brienne makes that top with ease but this is a good list besides
asoiaf,not_removed,great list can back my order up id like to see your reasoning for example why garlan over loras also assuming the top criterion is raw ability shouldnt oberyn outrank gregor he beat him easily and all he had to do was stand back and stab at him with that long spear until he bled out it was only his obsession with the confession that resulted in him getting his head squished but wait wheres bronn other notables who might make the honorable mention list include qhorin halfhand brynden blackfish the white bull areo hotah the greatjon syrio forel dagmer cleftjaw in his younger days asha with her throwing axes belwas and of course tyrion is pretty good with an axe just kidding and ramsay with his good men not also the other who bested waymar royce was pretty great i guess you have to decide whether the weapon is considered part of the warrior ie is it arthur dayne or arthur dayne wielding dawn or like that quote from ser eustace about daemon blackfyre ser eustace daemon stood straight and proud and his stomach was flat and hard as an oaken shield and he could fight with ax or lance or flail he was as good as any knight i ever saw but with the sword he was the warrior himself when prince daemon had blackfyre in his hand there was not a man to equal him not ulrick dayne with dawn no nor even the dragonknight with dark sister
asoiaf,not_removed,dont forget gwayne corbray that guy fight against daemon blackfyre in red grass field and gave a really good match
asoiaf,not_removed,my main criteria isnt having a top twenty of guys who cause me more harm than good sometimes ill take other aspects above sheer skill baristan selmy would be my first pick in any possible case loyal respects celibacy comes from a lesser house way less troubles and actually likes to fight without liking it too much he knows to ride he knows to duel he knows to be stealthy when required he knows how to train other knights he imposes respect he knows to keep his mouth shut why taking a when i can take a barristan is simply too solid of an investment to be ignored what about the others heres my criteria i dont want a guy who performs well only when hes full capacity aka mr lol bestswordinwesteros i want all rounders guys who can wreck with any weapon and whenever possible i want them with some humanity still left loyalty to me its pointless if other people hate my guy for other reasons because that means other troubles so more than a to id rather go by groups barristan good at every age selmy group of people you cant go wrong picking up robert duncan the tall sandor garlan tyrell loras tyrell balon swann brienne quentyn ball baelor breakspear some of these guys may have some issues but theyre solvable most of them are proven to be good at more than just swordfighting and used at least two weapons in the series with positive results notice that neither of them does actually need something valyrian to win a duel people you pick only if youre certain to be able to manage gregor clegane aemon the dragonknight and jaime must deal with their lovers probably bittersteel khal drogo victarion randyll tarly lyn corbray andrik oberyn some of them are sick good but you dont get only the martial man but rather the whole package if rules allow me to keep gregor clegane chained underground until i need him and i have a way to bring him back there without hurting him hes an instapick for example oberyns great but his main loyalty will always be towards himself same for bittersteel and corbray aemon and jaime look extremely tempting on paper but then you realize that they are capable of betrayal even better they have serious inclinations towards betrayal remember a stable jaime is a handless jaime and i dont want a maimed fighter to put it simply some of them call for troubles more than beric dondarrion calls for lethal wounds people who stay out daemon blackfyre mance they are built to be kings you either pick them first or you avoid them at all theres no way to have mances total loyalty and theres no way daemon wont outshine you and given his targ heritage jealous lords would conspire to put him on a throne i could take mance as first pick to have his loyalty but he smells and southron people wouldnt like him and they would like daemon too much
asoiaf,not_removed,leo tyrell is there another leo besides the lazy one i am forgetting that is comparable to hotk and crown prince baelor breakspear
asoiaf,not_removed,not arguing but wondering why arthur dayne is ahead of ser barristan
asoiaf,not_removed,the hound is a tough son of a bitch
asoiaf,not_removed,really daemon ahead of arthur id go with your list but reverse the order of the first two
asoiaf,not_removed,jon snow isnt even mentioned not saying hes top necessarily but i think he should be somewhere on the list
asoiaf,not_removed,your number is going to beat your number in the hypest fight of all time get your chickens ready
asoiaf,not_removed,its a crime that ryam redwyne isnt on this list anywhere
asoiaf,not_removed,my top marillion hizhdar xaro moon boy olly reek izembaro ser bennis of the brown shield john the fiddler lollys stokeworth honorable mention dolorous edd the contents of eurons chamber pot merrett frey maester aemon viserys
asoiaf,not_removed,within the context of the books we have seen brienne beat two of the people on this list
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah just because he was recognised as good by one of the best doesnt neccessarliy mean he should be top twenty all time there isnt really any other evidence of him doing anything other than sparring with the dragon knight
asoiaf,not_removed,no he said he never fought a finer swordsman theres quite a big difference between those two one means hes better than everyone and the other means hes only better than people aemon previously fought
asoiaf,not_removed,the man to lead a van i agree with that great combat leader but not necessarily the best fighter
asoiaf,not_removed,robert being the greatest adds another layer of tragedy to his whole character uncle rico with a warhammer instead of a football a castle depression alcoholism and a whore wife instead of living alone in a van it actually kind of saddens me how unmourned robert baratheon goes he was a bad king but essentially he was a good person out of his element
asoiaf,not_removed,im not sure if theon is as good a warrior as he is a savage leader and commander
asoiaf,not_removed,get fucking hype
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know if shed make top with ease but shes certainly above ser loras since she has beaten him
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks considered her but couldnt quiet fit her in with oath keeper she would probably beat loras in single combat tho fair point
asoiaf,not_removed,then biter should be in top right book brienne isnt that great a fighter as the show potrays her
asoiaf,not_removed,garlan over loras put simply loras admits that garlan is the better sword to add to this admission is garlans feats in the battle of black water wearing renlys armour he slayed guyard the green amongst others also seen sparring vs others pretty bad ass yes they all have their what you would call signature weaponary could name heaps of notables that dont quite have the evidence
asoiaf,not_removed,id take sandor easy incredibly loyal strong fast he likes to drink but that is really his only vice that and killing bronn is probably my next pick savage vicious killer he was tyrions right hand man in kings landing and basically ran most of his operation he might be only in it for coin but if you need a guy to run your back alley shit hes your man
asoiaf,not_removed,where do ser jorah and strong belwas fall in
asoiaf,not_removed,leo longthorn from the dunc and egg novellas
asoiaf,not_removed,ser barristan has the reputation over dayne to be sure but from all accounts arthur dayne was the finest swordsman that ever lived the dude is a legend and was jamies hero growing up i could see an argument for ser barristan and all but personally id take dayne for his sheer skill in battle
asoiaf,not_removed,show jon is a great warrior but this is spoilers published so i assume hes talking about book jon who hasnt actually fought anyone accept untrained recruits qhorin who lost on purpose a skrimish against the wildlings where summer saves his life and he gets shot in the leg with an arrow the battle where the wildings attack from the south and he can barely walk and that against mance who is glamoured as rattleshirt and beats the crap out of jon jon snow in the books isnt very accomplished
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah hes legendary but hard to have him with no evidence same as ulrick dayne symeon stareyes etc
asoiaf,not_removed,cregan stark was pretty old and not at his prime when he crossed blades with the dragonknight
asoiaf,not_removed,the man is almost a van by himself
asoiaf,not_removed,this says best warrior not best single combat fighter i dont think robert baratheon was actually killable in battle in his prime like i dont think grrm believes in divine protection but the man lead the van in his own rebellion and absolutely wrecked shit every single battle he should have been born dothraki he would have been the stallion who mounts the world
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah she has but loras feats in the battle of black water and then him capturing dragonstone for tommen since then made me take him over brienne
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty sure she is blindsided by the lb biter after she kills rogue is tackled to the ground and has her face smashed into the ground
asoiaf,not_removed,and to your point about oberyn ranking higher than gregor whilst oberyn may of defeated gregor in combat i would still back gregor to be a better chance against more opponents than oberyn i also like the idea of a mack truck leaving my van
asoiaf,not_removed,agree with sandor disagree with bronn bronn definitely belongs to the absolute bottom of group n° hes another victarionandrikcorbray with possibly even less social grace and most importantly the absolute certainty hell abandon you the moment he finds a better employer hes like a rorge who found tyrion instead of vargo hoat only better with a sword unless you are someone the likes of the tattered prince or tyrion who uses him for illegal activities from the very beginning to the very end until hes abandoned the farther from bronn the better
asoiaf,not_removed,strong belwas may be if he knows how to ride to fight on a horse and possibly using a armor an serious shield im not that sure given his background but who knows the sure thing is that him being an eunuch and apparently not greedy or corrupt makes him trustworthy if hes on your side in doubt i wouldnt pick him but only because were discussing the best of the best jorah is a big no imo regardless of the cathegory his questionable loyalty is too much of an issue for me lets look at his relationship with dany actually the one hes supposed to be totally loyal to he betrays her to varys suddenly he falls in love what about the moment his feelings are over he still does not confess hiding himself he never tells her about being a slaver he doesnt know his place kissing her he tries to alienate her from whoever is a male out of jealousy thats actively harming your lord too dependant on feelings too creepy too unreliable to top it all hes a manipulator he could be the best warrior in westeros for all i care id never want someone like him prime jaime at that point would be more trustworthy and he still someone who id choose only after more reliable fighters
asoiaf,not_removed,oooh that leo gotcha
asoiaf,not_removed,who is that specifically do you mean lazy leo
asoiaf,not_removed,but dayne was defeated by ned stark in single combat i feel like ser barristan would have whooped neds ass
asoiaf,not_removed,thats true i suppose he hasnt done a lot but based on his leadership and amount of training in the book i think it can be assumed that hes still a great warrior
asoiaf,not_removed,except people consistently say that he is the greatest knight of his day but ok
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime does why shouldnt i
asoiaf,not_removed,that just means brienne could accomplish those feats as well
asoiaf,not_removed,i figured we were drafting teams i already have barristan for the above board statecraft sandor for my brute force and then you grab bronn for your back alley work
asoiaf,not_removed,well in the books it is heavily implied that ned got a lot of help in the fight saying that he couldnt of won without howland reed barristan wouldve most likely went down the same way dayne did given it probably wasnt a fair fight in my opinion
asoiaf,not_removed,i think he has the potential to be but everyone on this list is actually proven if i had to choose id rather go for the sure thing than hope that this year old boy knows how to carry himself the first time hes called upon
asoiaf,not_removed,who says that i remeber him being mentioned as a part of songs and breaking lances with ulrick dayne but i cant remeber too many people saying it to be deemed consistent maester who wrote the rogue prince does say he is legendary when talking about cryston cole replacing him but there is zero evidence of him actually killing anyone or performing feats in war
asoiaf,not_removed,by that logic biter could accomplish those feats as well
asoiaf,not_removed,pretty general assumption that because brienne defeated loras at the very end of a knight meele that she could do the same feats as loras was a toss up between them two and rhaegar for spot though
asoiaf,not_removed,right i think the fight was like or something and only reed and stark walked away but its mentioned that neds men are overheard boasting about how ned had slain him in single combat which im just realizing now they werent even there and were probably just talking out of their asses
asoiaf,not_removed,hes older than now isnt he not that it really changes your point but isnt he like by the end of dwd
asoiaf,not_removed,well for one maester pylos tells davos that ryam is the greatest knight of his day but one of the worst hands ever bran thinks about how he wants to be a great kingsguard like ryam redwyne in agot as a matter of fact hes mentioned times in asoiaf and each time he is mentioned it is being synonymous with renowned warriors as a matter of fact based on the company hes mentioned with i would say he should be in the top easily just out of courtesy
asoiaf,not_removed,in fact since she struggled the way she did against jaime in his state shows that healthy two handed jaime makes quick work of her when does she struggle she is trying subdue him not kill him he is trying to kill her shes deliberately handicapping herself which jaime realizes perfectly well would he be better than her at full strength yes she admits as much when she says he was all she could handle but thats fair enough since he was probably the best swordsman in westeros at the time but how much better would he be at full strength even jaime doesnt know and he fully acknowledges shes stronger than he is he puts her in a greatjonclegane stratification of strength really all jaime does throughout their fight is think about how much he underestimated her kind of like fandom
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah she even says in her first pov in affc that jamie wouldve beaten her had he not been in that condition
asoiaf,not_removed,and wouldnt that put ned stark ahead of arthur dayne
asoiaf,not_removed,dont remember that fight that well tbh but i dont think it was
asoiaf,not_removed,yep thats how rumors become truth good catch
asoiaf,not_removed,in the books bran mentions ned always says that howland reed is the reason he won that fight the finest knight i ever saw was ser arthur dayne who fought with a blade called dawn forged from the heart of a fallen star they called him the sword of the morning and he would have killed me but for howland reed father had gotten sad then and he would say no more bran wished he had asked him what he meant acok bran iii
asoiaf,not_removed,hes when the books start its been like years so youre probably right hes even so we know who all of the other men are at the peak of their lives i expect jon might deserve to be on this list at the end though i wouldnt be shocked if hes more like a ned rhaegar and not really the greatest fighter of all time but good in his own right but nothing legendary if his arc goes the way its looking hes gonna be like argon the conqueror and not orys baratheon a true leader but not the dude who is gonna bash your face in
asoiaf,not_removed,dumbest comparison ive ever heard ned didnt beat arthur in a
asoiaf,not_removed,user name checks out ass hole i just know that in one of catlyns first chapters shes remembering hearing from neds men how he had slayed arthur dayne in single combat and later ned has that awesome dream about riding up on dayne hightower and some other of the kings guard during the rebellion
asoiaf,not_removed,you are not up to date friendo
asoiaf,not_removed,umaegordacruel may have been a little crass about it but you are leaving out some of the more important info we have about a pretty big plot point how far in the booksshow are you
asoiaf,not_removed,youre right i get it now though im on a my second read through but still on first book totally forgot about how that actually went down id love to believe ned could do that though
asoiaf,not_removed,apparently hes way behind
asoiaf,not_removed,the sea is very wet so saying something is drier than the sea is not saying much cos anything would be drier than the sea the lannisters are so harsh that anything would be gentler than them
asoiaf,not_removed,the sea is the opposite of dry and the lannisters are the opposite of gentle
asoiaf,not_removed,if someone tried to insult you by saying youre uglier than george clooney then you probably wouldnt really care since pretty much everyone is uglier than george clooney
asoiaf,not_removed,its saying that claiming to be gentler than a lannister is like claiming to be drier than the sea since the sea is literally a giant body of water literally anything can be classified as drier than the sea in the same way the lannisters are so cruel in her mind that even the most vile human could probably get away with claiming to be gentler than them
asoiaf,not_removed,shes saying that the lannisters arent gentle at all just as the sea isnt dry at all i agree its a bit of an awkward phrasing
asoiaf,not_removed,its a simile sort of the lannisters are not known for being a gentle kind friendly family so being gentler than them doesnt mean much same as the sea is wet so everything else bar rivers etc will always be drier than the sea
asoiaf,not_removed,clooney hehe baby boomer over here
asoiaf,not_removed,great explanation
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean it depends on the context if someone said im gentler than the lannisters and this is the response its perfectly phrased being gentler than a lannister doesnt mean much because everyone is gentler than a lannister
asoiaf,not_removed,paul newman
asoiaf,not_removed,charlie chaplin
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime lannister
asoiaf,not_removed,shepard
asoiaf,not_removed,well bang ok
asoiaf,not_removed,siha
asoiaf,not_removed,holy shit thats youngso sad is it typical for humans that height to die of heart failure
asoiaf,not_removed,and so the giant cried for there were no more
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope you took some crows with you not literally because death sucks for anyone but figuratively go out with your boots on homie
asoiaf,not_removed,and now his watch has ended
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean he was the tallest known person in the entire uk he wasnt going to live much longer than no matter what tall people and short people both have a lot of health problems and one of the ones that kills tall people is extreme heart overwork too much body for the human heart to handle once they get around their heart just goes out he lived a long life for someone that tall
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,omg this guy went to my high schooli had no idea he was in thrones love for his family no i did not know him
asoiaf,not_removed,he got a great scene to go out on in got rip
asoiaf,not_removed,he was also in doctor who as the fisher king this is quite sad news
asoiaf,not_removed,and so the giant cried for there were no more
asoiaf,not_removed,actually yeah dwarfism or gigantism are typically symptoms of another illness often related to growth hormones when your body doesnt grow properly either too big or too small all kinds of complications can occur on the size alone excluding the illness that caused the incorrect size in the first place larger people both fat or exceedingly tall are all at a higher risk for heart disease and this guy was like plus feet being tall alone actually doesnt make you at risk but conditions that abnormally increase your height often end with some kind of heart failure youll notice you dont see many old people who are crazy tall or very fat
asoiaf,not_removed,he was he had giantism which means his heart likely gave
asoiaf,not_removed,way too young i would hazard a guess it had something to do with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
asoiaf,not_removed,being really tall with extra long armslegshands are a few indicators of marphans syndrome the dangerous part of it is thar they may have weak heart tissue which is a problem for those who get recruited into basketball or volleyball
asoiaf,not_removed,whats that from asoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,and now his watch is ended its is not has very common mistake
asoiaf,not_removed,george
asoiaf,not_removed,nitpicking but i dont think he had gigantism he came from a very tall family so i believe his height was purely genetic
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought it was httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpthelastofthegiants but the lyrics dont seem to match
asoiaf,not_removed,ive got serious concerns he wont make it i know he hates to hear that and its supposedly a dickish thing to say because it implies we care more about the books than we do about his life but i honestly cant imagine not being able to ever finish the series as written by grrm hes said he wouldnt let anyone complete the series if he died and even if they did it wouldnt have been the real deal someone else would have to write in the blanks and it wouldnt be georges work i think hes seriously in danger of not finishing the series i cant imagine hed live to see
asoiaf,not_removed,according to a wiki quote he was nearly foot tall at age highly doubt he didnt have some medical condition
asoiaf,not_removed,hes said he wouldnt let anyone complete the series if he died this is kind of a myth he never really said this
asoiaf,not_removed,oh well thank god for that i wouldnt put it past him to be spiteful though as he has said he doesnt want people doing spinoffs or other stories in his world
asoiaf,not_removed,beautiful argument i couldnt do better myself
asoiaf,not_removed,do note that the civility policy under rule isnt optional nor is this your first warning
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis is hard to say as his version of mercy to the remaining factions is tied to his perception of sincerity and honor hed probably be a brutal bastard to everyone but the northern houses and perhaps dorne due to their history of being a bit apart from the rest of the realm his rule is probably effective if not not beloved renly probably just asks everyone left to bend then knee and rolls back out for a few skirmishes with the kingdoms that dont his sheer charisma and volume of forces would allow him to win several of such battles along with the wealth of highgarden at his back at some point hed make a point of giving stannis some due though stannis rejects what is an otherwise genuine offer such as hand because hes stannis they attempt to politically bury the lannisters still their chief rival but fail starting another brutal but brief war that ends with the riverlands burning but casterly rock smashed under two kingdoms worth of forces his rule is probably mediocre but long and peaceful other than the lannister issue balon would never win so theres no point in worrying about it with robb alive balon gets blasted back to the seastone chair so fast house greyjoy changes their sigil to a westerly blowing wind robb would attempt to broker peace under his crown but i suspect stannis would hold out recognizing that there could be no united realm under his reign they would reach an agreement where robb just secedes from the realm for real and is king in the north with stannis as the king of the kingdoms or since we can just call the riverlands a kingdom for the sake of the name the retain peaceful trade and political agreements and the secession is largely symbolic at the end of the day but very important for the northmen and would be a huge point of contention were aegon or dany ever attempt to conquer the kingdoms themselves down the line
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis wins if stannis holds kingslanding and by extension sansa then robb would probably bend the knee to him give him jaime in exchange for sansa and either join in on stannis campaign against the lannisters or march north to clear the ironborn from their coasts stannis likely also makes some concessions to robb if he immediately gives up any claim to rule an independent kingdom without question given how he rebelled before stannis had declared his claim stannis isnt incapable of compromise from what weve seen joffrey and cersei are certainly both executed probably jaime as well and its very likely tyrion is executed too the trick with the wildfire will likely not earn him any kind of mercy although its possible stannis will look at him as having made a similar choice to the one he made in regards to roberts rebellion where he chose family over king but considering the vastly different circumstances he likely doesnt consider them comparable choices and probably executes him when hes done with the lannisters he almost certainly begins plotting to destroy the ironborn petty kingdom renly renly would probably make a deal for the starks to bend the knee granting them the same autonomy dorne has and the same right to identify themselves using a royal title rhoynar custom has prince being an equivalent title to king stannis is dead hes never ever going to agree to bend the knee to his brother and he will be killed after he refuses he also wont have too much difficulty fathering an heir or two hes gay but that hasnt stopped other gay men from fathering children out of obligation worst case scenario he only ever has sex with margaery as part of a three way with loras robb robb doesnt want the iron throne and wont fight for it winning for him means forcing tywin to acknowledge the independence of the north and trident from the realm at large and the return of his sisters and ice after that he does not care what happens if stannis holds kings landing but tywin is still going to fight for tommens claim then robb has essentially guaranteed the norths independence winter will come making an invasion of his kingdom impossible for years to come and after that things depend on what happens in the long term from there he returns to the north to clear it of ironborn probably finds his two brothers alive and arya will eventually pop up if she avoids death because with the war over most of her difficulty in returning home will vanish if stannis eventually manages to conquer and hold the iron throne after tywin has already acknowledged the norths independence then hes likely too weak to actually invade this new kingdom and so some kind of deal will have to be figured out or stannis tries to kill him with red priest magic but even that has its limits and stannis might die trying to invade the north at which point the seven kingdoms likely balkanizes into its remaining component parts
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis would have executed cersei and tyrion and joffrey the moment his arse touched the throne he wouldnt have ordered to kill the kids but some of his men might do it for him he would have kept them imprisoned though he would have demanded robb bending his knee maybe even promising to deal with the ironborn after robb helped him defeat tywin
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis would put cersei jaime and their kids heads on spikes he would return the stark daughters back to robb alive or dead then he would prepare to invade any lands that refused to bend in other words a king
asoiaf,not_removed,yeh balon is a model of moronic nationalism his plan to invade the north was awful and should have fallen apart quickly renly would just let the tyrells take over the court stannis would enforce justice
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis would have executed all the lannisters and others that actively opposed him but allowed their heirs and kin to bend the knee renly wouldve pardoned stannis if stannis wouldve agreed to renounce his claim to the throne stannis would never do that though so renly would have no choice but to condemn him for treason he probably wouldve offered him the wall although im not sure stannis would accept that offer being who he is he may well prefer to die for a cause he believes is just over living out his days in servitude forever tainted by treason yes robb wouldve returned to the north it is unclear what he wouldve done with kl and the iron throne personally i believe that he wouldve recognized that six kingdoms under one throne would always pose a major threat to the north possibly including the riverlands and subsequently symbolically razed the red keep over the iron throne and proclaimed that all six kingdoms had regained their independence balon would never have any interest in sitting the iron throne if he got the opportunity he would probably sack and pillage kl and sail back to his islands i genuinely dont believe that he and most ironborn wouldve had any interest in the parts of westeros far from water he wouldve liked to rule the western coast the riverlands and possibly a few portscastles along the mander and the honeywine
asoiaf,not_removed,would he still allow him to be the prince of dragonstone until he somehow managed to produce an heir with margaery this one is a bit silly in the books we know he was a lover to loras but we dont know whether he was gay or bisexual i am pretty sure even a gay person can do and did their royal duty back in the day as for his rule i think renly wouldve defeated the lannisters with quite some ease and if it wasnt for shadowbaby defeat his brother too once that was is over he is more likely than stannis to recognize the north as a sovereign nation than stannis or tywin ever is but as long as robb swears some sort of allegiance to him and offers open borders for trade i dont think renly would care that much if robb supported his claim after stannis diesis defeated he would have been an okay king not as useless as robert not as mad as aerys but there would more likely than not have been peace his charisma and good looks would make him popular with commoners and nobles alike even if he would probably reshuffle the council a little bit some redwyne and tyrell faces up in there most likely
asoiaf,not_removed,robb probably wouldve made peace with stannis
asoiaf,not_removed,daemon ii blackfyre wouldve ruled with a firm hand and a loose asshole
asoiaf,not_removed,id say we should only view the wofk as a phase during a longer conflict the same way individual wars in the got swallowed up by the thirty years war so i wouldnt quite say that joffrey and that really means tywin won but for how theyd have ruled if theyd taken kl in that phase robb i robb couldnt sit on the iron throne for multiple reasons his ascension to it would have the same problem as a tyrell or lannister seizing the throne it doesnt even have the fig leaf robert did of recent targaryen ancestry robb is an old gods worshiper while the throne has some expectation of supporting the faith even with the riverlands robb doesnt have remotely the manpower to control westeros without at least an alliance with the tyrells or lannisters so it wouldnt have been robb or bran or edmure ii if hed been able to defeat tywin in the westerlands and force tyrion and cersei to sue for peace at the least the kingdom of the north and riverlands would exist independently for a time until a powerful king sat on the iron throne and could force the north to come to terms or fight a bad war quite possibly it would have meant the entire iron throne system falling apart as independent monarchism looked more attractive than a system that had produced a terrible king a civil war a neglectful king a boy king who might be terrible and another civil war resulting in a huge chunk of the nation splitting away iii hed probably spend a good deal of time integrating the north and riverlands working out marriage alliances to keep it working and trying to figure out what the heck is wrong with his aunt and reaching out to sympathizers like house royce once it becomes clear lysa isnt going to marry any of her lords she might be forced to have pronorth politics which would vastly improve robbs position renly i on stannis if stannis had been willing to step aside for renly hed probably have let stannis keep some position so he could say both baratheon brothers are against that brat joffrey but stannis would have little power at all if stannis hadnt well renly fully desired for stannis to die in battle so there wouldnt be any uncertainty about brothers and the rule of eldest first so with their personalities either stannis would kill or ruin renly or renly would kill stannis ii i think some kind of autonomy deal might be allowed especially since if robb acknowledged him as king the tullys would follow and that would put three leading houses behind renly making him look very kinglike the details would be tricky though iii ultimately renlys policies could make westeros pretty unstable as a lot of second brothers declare theyre better than their elder and elder brothers have to watch their backs around family as much as outsiders it would also lead to the grip on the iron throne only being strong for renly and maybe his children with tyrell backing after that it depends entirely on the king and the alliances whether or not his grandchildren could hold on to the throne after all renly explicitly rejected the argument for baratheon descent from targaryens in favor of i have an army in maybe forty years it could be a lannister backed by the vale and dorne stannis i stannis before his defeat would be somewhat better than joffrey as king of course hot pie would probably be a better king than joffrey but im not sure hed really be any better than renly he thinks on past wrongs and grudges a lot and compromises very poorly hed probably spend a good bit of his reign at war hampered by his poor ability to befriend people he might be able to accept the need to compromise with the starks somewhat and the war against balon would make them closer but it would be uneasy at best with melisandre he might get the faith militant illegally revived to fight him ii im sure a lot of lannisters die when he takes over tommen and myrcella might be allowed to go be septon and septa stannis isnt tywin joffreys definitely dead balon well we saw what balons policies would be twice during the first war he made robert fight all the way into balons castles so hes very stubborn even when he should just give up during the second when the ironborn were occupying part of the noth he never once provided an answer for the constant old way problem their strategies only work when continental powers are weak and distracted and the ironborn are never able to get their conquered people to like them even the ones who are genetically closer to ironborn than first men seem to culturally give up ironborn ethnicity for the mainland one helped a lot im sure by the old way insistence that agriculture isnt a job for a real man we dont see anything from balon about how to reconcile the northerners to ironborn rule its asha whos arguing for a fundamental rethink of security and trade arrangements and she needed the push from seeing that the war wasnt getting them the wealth theyd thought it would and the northerners werent going down easy so no matter who sat on the iron throne or if robb had crushed tywins army balon would insist on throwing men and resources into keeping an empire that would sooner or later be destroyed and which he couldnt afford to maintain anyway and force his enemies to sail to the iron islands to break him
asoiaf,not_removed,im not even going to ask about balon gonna answer anyways balon never wanted to be king of the seven kingdoms he wanted to be the king of salt and rock lord reaver of pyke he wanted the seven kingdoms to become the ironborns reaving grounds again like they were under dalton the red kraken or the old ironborn kings other than that hed probably let them do what they wanted so long as they didnt try that whole united front against him thing again
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime could have rules with an iron fist
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis kills the kingslayer cersei the imp varys little finger pycelle and if tywin does not surrender then him too he would give robb the choice bend the knee or die renly would let robb call himself king and probably let little finger etc live but remove them from council cersei and kingslayer die renly should have bent the knee to stannis and became his heir imo
asoiaf,not_removed,doesnt matter all would have a shit show on their hands once the others arrive
asoiaf,not_removed,i dig most of this but i dont see stannis ever giving rob and the north sovereignty rob either bends the knee or is fighting battles and running back in forth from the north and the riverlands attacking and retreating until he dies
asoiaf,not_removed,i think your assessment is very accurate a couple notes of my own i think if renly got long and peaceful that would be as good as you could reasonably expect in westeros i dont imagine the martells would be happy at all with the reach and the stormlands united together but theyd probably be smart enough to keep their heads down about it you might see the isolation of dorne from roberts rule growing and dorne acting more and more independently
asoiaf,not_removed,one of the reason why stannis would have been king os that he is utterly unforgiving to corruption robert and jon arryn was way to forgiving
asoiaf,not_removed,renly would probably make a deal for the starks to bend the knee granting them the same autonomy dorne has and the same right to identify themselves using a royal title rhoynar custom has prince being an equivalent title to king does dorne really have more autonomy than the other kingdoms though apart from being allowed to retain the title of prince do the martells exert more control over dorne than the starks do other the north or the lannisters over the westerlands etc
asoiaf,not_removed,wildfire is merely a weapon of war just like how targaryens used dragons its not worse than how renly was assassinated by shadow baby
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis did privately tell catelyn hed send her daughters back to her a contrast to renly making a big public show of how hed fight the lannisters
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis wouldnt have executed tyrion why would he in his opinion he was doing his duty to his liege like everyone else he would be pardoned if tyrion acts diplomatic enough or sent to the wall at worst
asoiaf,not_removed,i like to think he would have spared tyrion and offered him the rights to casterly rock if he agreed to serve himtywin could be dealt with
asoiaf,not_removed,he told lady catelyn that he would send them back first thing didnt he i dont think he would lie about that
asoiaf,not_removed,if his deal he offered to the lannisters basically do what theyre doing but have it legal afterwards only asked for what they already owned they might actually be somewhere asha queen
asoiaf,not_removed,im bi myself however in the show he was obviously very uncomfortable with the idea of sex with margaery and that is the only concrete evidence we have of his preferences also as an usurper himself we know hes not very beholden to tradition he might not care that much about leaving the throne for his children after hes gone hes pretty selfcentered
asoiaf,not_removed,as in robb is king or stannis is king
asoiaf,not_removed,a golden fist more like
asoiaf,not_removed,except stannis the king who cared
asoiaf,not_removed,i think that stannis would be smart enough to recognize the north as too large to hold plus that idea is contingent on robb winning the war so stannis wouldnt have the whole of his army to fight back it would be more like robb is ceding the rest of the realm to stannis out of understanding that he doesnt want to sit the iron throne and that he just wants to go back to winterfell and have everything just be okay
asoiaf,not_removed,or stannis dies which to frank is more likely
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed but i was at work and didnt have all day to type out all my thoughts bottom line only way the kingdoms remain united is by force or if roberts succession was uneventful which it super wasnt
asoiaf,not_removed,does dorne really have more autonomy than the other kingdoms though apart from being allowed to retain the title of prince do the martells exert more control over dorne than the starks do other the north or the lannisters over the westerlands etc yes according to the world of ice and fire dorne was accorded special privileges on entering the realm its never really explained what those privileges are but its probably stuff like special leeway to choose their own inheritance rules to maintain their particular customs around marriage and a bunch of other stuff we as readers dont give a shit about like more leeway to determine what is an appropriate number of trees to fell yearly
asoiaf,not_removed,title of prince keep their own laws every other kingdom follows the same laws created by king jahareys raise their own taxes with less oversight from the iron throne oldest child regardless of gender inherits
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont really think its much of a contrast its just different ways of currying favor for different circumstances
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion was the acting hand for joffrey at the time i dont think stannis would pardon him for that
asoiaf,not_removed,however in the show he was obviously very uncomfortable with the idea of sex with margaery and that is the only concrete evidence we have of his preferences the show also made the manderlys not help defeat the boltons and turned loras into an open homosexual who goes through lovers at the same pace as king robert just saying also as an usurper himself we know hes not very beholden to tradition he has the right blood and the political connections a usurper with a strong claim still cares for tradition especially when it benefits him he understands perfectly well that he needs a heir he might not care that much about leaving the throne for his children after hes gone he is the master of law he would not forget that needing a heir is pretty important hes pretty selfcentered where do you get that from i picture him as ambitious for wanting to steal the throne but never selfcentered both in books and show he is known as a man who is liked by commoners and nobles alike you dont end up liked if you care only for your own hide
asoiaf,not_removed,both are king but of two different kingdoms
asoiaf,not_removed,near enough as to make no matter like nipples on a breast plate
asoiaf,not_removed,except stannis the king who cared died shortly after a losing battle when he underestimated the loyalty of the average man to a child killer
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis is stannis sure it might be too big to hold but he would make the place pretty hellish should they insist on independence remember what he did to the karstarks that came to his camp or what he has told the others even if he cant hold the north he can still cripple them until they kneel or starve to death
asoiaf,not_removed,huh til i guess its about time i picked up a copy of a world of ice and fire
asoiaf,not_removed,sir stannis would never allow that thats why they didnt join forces to begin with the only one okay with that was renly
asoiaf,not_removed,whether or not you like stannis isnt the point the point is that he actually gave a mind to the threat of white walkers when no one else did samwell tarly gave the quote a king that still cared referring to stannis as the only lord in all of westeros who actually answered his letter for help with the wildlings you might hate him but if he was king he would have stood up to the wildlings at least more so than everyone else
asoiaf,not_removed,and stannis story is largely about redemption from zealotry i feel that if he lives it will be as a more thoughtful and less rigid stannis hes still be as hard and cold as iron but less of a total dick about it to the point he could be negotiated with but not easily id reason
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont hate stannis i nothing stannis but hes a child killer and much of the fan base acts like the sun shines out of his ass despite his final act being something that even the dark lord tywin didnt have it in him to do edit downvoting doesnt change the facts stannis murdered his child for a supposed greater good tywin refused to do so
asoiaf,not_removed,selyse and shireen arrive at castle black from eastwatch in adwd jon ix shireen is fascinated with wun wun
asoiaf,not_removed,shireen is at caste black now doesnt really matter regardless we have two giant volumes to go arya is in braavos dany is in the dothraki sea they wont stay there forever as has been repeatedly demonstrated multiples times since that night stannis burning shireen came straight from grrm
asoiaf,not_removed,we will see i guess i feel like he will be less overzealous and focus more on the people rather than the person but i think that he will still be pretty set on robb giving in also im not certain that redemption from zealotry is the end goal for stannis story a lot of what ive read leads me to believe that the main moral iswill be save the kingdom to win the throne zealotry isnt what has been making stannis do his more iron things in the last few chapters for instance
asoiaf,not_removed,discussing how to acquire pirated material is not allowed on rasoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean i guess thats the iron price i dont think balon would like it much though
asoiaf,not_removed,well even if that is true it doesnt change the point that he was the best shot against the others although at this point we know that dany and jon are going to swoop in and save the day because they seem to be the generic disney heroes everyone wants as for tywin as he says himself to tyrion i let you live because youre a lannister i personally believe in the theory that tyrion is a targaryen born by joanna and the mad king which explains tywins hatred for tyrion but tyrion bares the lannister name and tywin cannot undermine that name by killing any lannister – especially his own son – even if they are a dwarf he doesnt let tyrion live for any reason other than that
asoiaf,not_removed,only the burning of shireen came from grrm not that stannis did it
asoiaf,not_removed,i was oversimplifying his story he wont ever be redeemed for the things he did in the name of rhllor but he will be able to recognize his humanity again and become the man he thought he was being the whole time by become less of a zealot and more a secular man of the kingdom i just cut that into a pithy title for his story arc
asoiaf,not_removed,the best shot against the others has dragons and hasnt arrived the war of kings was a giant distraction over a chair to make the realm nice and raw for when the others arrive and try to skullfuck it
asoiaf,not_removed,in his defense he didnt know tyrion was innocent and this was cerseis doing not his he already said he wouldve let tyrion go to the wall and we dont know what he wouldve done had he not escaped
asoiaf,not_removed,we dont know what he actually planned to do he didnt order someone to set him on fire to appease a deity and maybe melt some snow at least their relationship grew to be antagonistic how was stanniss with shireen
asoiaf,not_removed,untrue watch the clip they say it completes stanniss arc and that he told them about it
asoiaf,not_removed,well yeah i did point out dany but the people of westeros dont know dany exists for the most part stannis is the only person in all of westeros who answers the call without him the nights watch probably all wouldve been slaughtered and the others would have taken over before dany even arrived
asoiaf,not_removed,but he will fail because of his little sacrifice
asoiaf,not_removed,the battle of the bastards will happen stannis will die way before say what you want about tywin he never personally ordered his kid burnt to death and its indefensible hes not a hero
asoiaf,not_removed,so why are many treating him like a hero
asoiaf,not_removed,as i understand it and im sure someone will correct any errors they originally wanted to do seasons of episodes hbo asked them to do an openended number of seasons which they turned down finally agreeing on the current run later since no one else corrected me its actually hours like breaking bad mad men and a slew of others they decided to break the final season into two parts i believe this strategy is based on the fact that hbo gets and keeps subscriptions based on the ongoing nature of its most popular shows got having surpassed the sopranos as the most popular hbo show ever so two shorter seasons buys them another year of got being a going concern and a viral sensation in other words in dollars and cents the overall calendar length of the run is as valuable or more valuable than the actual number of episodes or hours of broadcast time
asoiaf,not_removed,the stuff theyve cut is generally not stuff thats necessary to the central plot or that would translate well on screen
asoiaf,not_removed,now the next question of course is why didnt they accept the offer of seasons when it was offered many will chime in and say they didnt want to devote so much of their lives to it or they were burned out or because reddit hates affcadwd so much and they could never be adapted bla bla bla ughh or whatever but my sense is that it was as follows they did the first three seasons they set seasons in their minds and started making the unretractable plot and character decisions necessary to facilitate that length by the time they got the offer and a significant part of the fandom started to complain about way they were abridging plot and characters it was too late by early season the die was cast there was no practical way to get back to the kind of arc that a significant part of the fandom wanted the part of the fandom from whose perspective im writing not the larger part that thinks the show is much better than the books and is downvoting me to hell for daring to question them in other words once they gutted mance the battles of ice and fire dorne the iron islands stannis the riverlands the vale the tyrells and the sparrow movement and completely removed the aegon vigolden company plot a run of longer than seasons wouldnt have worked anyway had hbo made the offer more forcefully and done it well before the scripts for season were written we might have an entirely different show on our hands by the way a came out today from game of thrones academy that goes into great detail on the lotr and asoiaf adaptations later lol i had to look up good thing i didnt ask what it meant or you wouldve had to it to me still later downvote like youre
asoiaf,not_removed,the central plot what would you say is the central plot
asoiaf,not_removed,now the next question of course is why didnt they accept the offer of seasons when it was offered one each additional season would require renegotiating with all of the actors they want to keep which means pay increases ballooning the budget it also means that at any point along the way one or more actors could decide that they didnt want to stay with the project how does it affect the show and the quality if say aiden gillen decides he wants to move on to other projects and suddenly they dont have littlefinger anymore right in the middle of a plotline two as a corollary theres burnout not just for the actors but for all the crew behind the scenes benioff and weiss are the most visible but theres a lot of people who work on the show and have been there from the beginning who are already spending the better part of a decade on the show three audiences tend to have a finite taste for things even the most popular theres no reason to want to drag the show out until people start getting bored with it then give it a hasty ending once its become less popular especially when dragging it out would only make audience fatigue set in faster oh its six seasons after dany got her army and she still hasnt headed for westeros the ice demons still havent reached the wall yawn lots of people had already had enough of the footdragging in some plots its better for the show and for its legacy to wrap things up in good time without having to be booed off stage
asoiaf,not_removed,i suppose thats possible or they wanted to tailer the amount of episode time to the outline so there is no faff
asoiaf,not_removed,im sure youd try to pick apart any other answer so ill just say the stuff following people who have been the main characters since book rather than sideplots following people introduced in books and
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe we can come to an agreement at least on the nature of the disagreement i concede that if books and fail to prove as vital to the completed saga as books did that martins choice to keep building outwards in book was misguided and that the series never should have gone more than or books in the first place your comment indicates that this is what you believe to be true and if youre right then ill go a step further and concede that the show was right to do what it did but while the jury is out on the conclusion of the books the reason i and much of the other half of the fandom currently disagree with you so vehemently is that having gone many times through books and and the prequels and the sample chapters and world book and most of the best essays here and elsewhere we find these sideplots not to be sideplots at all but to greatly expand the broader meaning of the story which is why i question your notion of the central plot and if read carefully to be supremely intricate and interesting unto themselves if they werent there wouldnt exist such an unprecedented amount of speculation over theorizing about and nearrapid anticipation of the next book to put it another way i propose that this series is not an epic fantasy series at all nor the literary equivalent of a summer blockbuster i think the author is trying for something else entirely that hes trying and i admit that the jury is out on his success to write something timeless that synthesizes multiple genre and speaks to the human condition and human history in profound ways if and i concede that the preposition is if that proves to be the case then the show has missed the point and missed a tremendous opportunity
asoiaf,not_removed,people who have been the main characters since book rather than sideplots following people introduced in books and another way of looking at this is that instead of following specific people who were introduced in book were following types of people types of interactions types of institutional failure that have been around since book but now were seeing new manifestions of the same problems character a may be killed off or fade out of the plot but character b introduced later lets us see that what we learned from following character a wasnt unique to that character but part of a pattern the simplest example is the highlyrated post of about a month ago where the poster showed how each act of the story had a different chief antagonist if you want an example of a character introduced late who still rises to the same level of intensity consider euron greyjoy
asoiaf,not_removed,hey there your post was removed because its off topic not likely to lead to discussion of grrms story or world or silly this kind of content would be best in our motley monday stickied threads thank you
asoiaf,not_removed,yes she was a bargaining chip medieval societies use noble women to seal alliances the intention was to ally the targaryens to drogo and have him help them fight however viserys failed to impress and drogo didnt seem to particularly want to go fight for him illyrio did not make any money off the deal it was a financially losing transaction for him his motives are nebulous at the point of the story youre in had viserys acted more like aegon the conqueror and impressed the dothraki with his warrior ways i think his new brother in law might have been interested in a sea trip the plunder and the adventure fighting beside a purple eyed warrior hero might have been a worthy call hell id be interested in reading that novel but who would fight for a whiny manchild like viserys viserys gets a bad reputation in my opinion who he became wasnt exactly his fault but no army would follow the man he grew into
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think thats all there is to it i think there is much more to it because of the scope of the spoilers i cant fully explain myself but to say that illyrio just gave dany to drogo as a gift is just the beginning
asoiaf,not_removed,uhh its pretty clear in book that illyrios goal is to have them invade westeros right wasnt the convo between illyrio and varys in book it wasnt about preventing the dothraki from sacking pentos
asoiaf,not_removed,if she is only a payment then why the three eggs they werent dragons but still priceless
asoiaf,not_removed,yes she was used to further illyrios goals no it was not to keep the dothraki off his back he mentions in danys first or second chapter how relatively cheap it is to appease the dothraki on top of his and varys conversation confirming that he did plan on a dothraki invasion of westeros the ninetowered manse of khal drogo sat beside the waters of the bay its high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy it had been given to the khal by the magisters of pentos illyrio told them the free cities were always generous with the horselords it is not that we fear these barbarians illyrio would explain with a smile the lord of light would hold our city walls against a million dothraki or so the red priests promise yet why take chances when their friendship comes so cheap
asoiaf,not_removed,great analysis i always thought that i was the one who pitied viserys at all among those i discussed him with theres one chapter early on in agot that made me feel sorry for him upon rereading where iirc he asks illyrio a question about house targaryen and he gives him an inflated answer to fill his head with greatness and ambition afterwards he looks out the window with his hand on his sword and daenerys knew he was fighting on the trident again something like that he really is a manchild like you say with deluded visions of grandeur that daenerys seems to have far greater insight towards even given her younger age it really makes me wonder how exactly viserys developed his personality and who had the biggest influence on him while roaming the free cities after the death of ser willem darry
asoiaf,not_removed,s do you see faegon as a backup to dany or dany as a backup to faegon or was dany being given to barbarians to get rid of claimants for faegons throne
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed
asoiaf,not_removed,that was my response to this as well that conversation arya overhears is crucial
asoiaf,not_removed,exactly the value of his gift shows theres more going on here the three eggs are worth so much more than dany at that point in the story she is just the sister of a man from a deposed dynasty whose weak claim lies across the sea somewhere the dothraki have no desire to travel if illyrio was just trying to pay them off surely hed give the eggs to drogo instead of giving dany to drogo and the eggs to dany dany has no inherent value to drogo and actually comes with a debt attached to provide an army for viserys although whether he ever intends to pay that debt when he marries her is debatable
asoiaf,not_removed,they probably were just a wedding gift to show how rich he is and how much he respects drogo do you think he knew they would hatch
asoiaf,not_removed,thats not how spoiler scopes work dude
asoiaf,not_removed,i totally feel sorry for him no doubt he was suffering from ptsd of high order his whole family was murdered and they fled into a foreign country and were forced into poverty sure his dad was a psychopath but he wouldnt have known that all hed know is that everyone he ever cared about or who cared for him are dead and plenty of people who said they cared about him didnt really he just wasnt strong enough to rise above it would i be i dont know its hard to think good of viserys because hes such a creepy asshole when you read the sections hes in but thinking about him later i really felt bad for the kid the world didnt do him any favors theres a saying total understanding brings total forgiveness i dont have to like who he was to understand why he was that way
asoiaf,not_removed,it really makes me wonder how exactly viserys developed his personality and who had the biggest influence on him while roaming the free cities after the death of ser willem darry you have to remember though that viserys paranoia began well before their family was deposed s from birth viserys was treated like a super special boy by aerys who banned people from being alone with the prince even down to rhaella his mother all his food was tested for poison viserys wasnt allowed to attend rhaegars wedding at his fathers command aerys didnt go either he thought he would be attacked if he left maegors holdfast so viserys was raised in total isolation in the red keep on the orders of a paranoid schizophrenic then when hes they flee to dragonstone and then to braavos he was never going to be the epitome of good mental health mods do i need to put this behind a twoiaf spoiler scope unsure
asoiaf,not_removed,the latter illyrio plan with dany was mostly in agot dany and the dothraki were just supposed to invade to weaken westeros the other goal for her was to hatch those eggs thats why jorah was always trying to get her to asshai and then once they hatched he turned her away from asshai
asoiaf,not_removed,they are pieces in play
asoiaf,not_removed,i figured that illyria wanted the eggs to be sold whether bydany herself or if she was convinced to do so by viserys or drogo to buy ships and sell swords so that they can invade westeros and cause chaos to set the stage for faegons triumphant return
asoiaf,not_removed,i think being without any form of family is what did it the most he had a strong conviction that the targaryan was wronged and slandered with false crimes during the rebellion as a result of having to i assume raise himself and daenerys its easy to paint create your own family history based on conflicting stories without anyone to provide context especially when trying to survive in multiple politically independent states across an ocean i wonder what kind of person he would have grown into if he had been raised by one who would divulge him with a more truthful version of events like if his mother survived daerneryss birth or if someone like ser barristan was charged with their care
asoiaf,not_removed,i always think this and add to it what a monumental task it would have been to have a young sister to care for as well hes not likeable by any stretch of the imagination but i have a lot of sympathy for him
asoiaf,not_removed,yes id say just cover the first paragraph with to be safe thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,i forgot that he was so old when they fled i guess at this point it becomes a psychological discussion on at what point someones mind and personality can be restructured but yeah may have been a lost cause regardless
asoiaf,not_removed,s exactly vd were never supposed to succeed they were intended to create chaos and weaken all of the existing families and get people used to the idea of the targs again so that faegon could come sailing in
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe but a chest full of gold or a small bag of diamonds would probably work better no sentimental attachment for targaryens to gold or gems whereas dragon eggs run the risk of dany not wanting to let them go due to what they represent
asoiaf,not_removed,if ser barristan hadnt been wounded on the tridant and took over raising viserys the purple eyed boy probably have become the man everyone remembers rhaeger as bit of a shame i dont think it has anything to do with version of events either i think its just a matter of getting the right qualities in your parental figure love respect kindness strength courage all the things barristan has in spades or at least seems to dude would have been an awesome dad for viserys let alone dany and years old isnt too late to fix problems in his personality id read that story barristan raising viserys on the edge of civilization into a warrior hero like aegon reborn until he can come reclaim his kingdom but then i do like happy endings
asoiaf,not_removed,did that work on mobile hard to format
asoiaf,not_removed,yes its perfect thanks
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe they wield the unknown dark energy and turn it into kinetic energy and release it on the micro level or simply heat in another word magic
asoiaf,not_removed,dragons are fire made flesh
asoiaf,not_removed,so you want scientific explanation on how some mythological creature works
asoiaf,not_removed,two dragons can harness energy from volcanos they have a special type of mechanism that allows dragon to store extreme heat and then release them each dragon is like a giant battery or gas tank the probably is when dragons are destroyed these energy are gone instead of a huge explosion also even danys dragons who never harnessed power from a large heat source can breathe fire making this much less likely to be true
asoiaf,not_removed,i like to think their high protein diets somehow create a flammable substance liquid in their gut and highly specialised natural voltaic cells exist in their throats which ignite it upon expulsion or the substance is high in something like pure sodium that ignites when it comes in contact with either air or something secreted by cells in their throat an exothermic reaction disclaimer i have a basic knowledge of chemistry
asoiaf,not_removed,my pet theory they have two different types of glands in their throats that hold two different substances that only become volatile upon being mixed together which occurs by reflex whenever the dragon wishes to roast someone
asoiaf,not_removed,i know this wouldnt work in grrms world but i always loved the argument in the book flight of dragons by peter dickinson according to dickinsons hypothesis the chief obstacle to admitting the past existence of dragons is the difficulty of powered flight by so large an organism to resolve this he introduces a dirigiblelike structure in which hydrochloric acid would dissolve large amounts of rapidly growing bone releasing massive amounts of hydrogen that once aloft would support the body above the ground the dragons wings are traced to modifications of the ribcage an anatomical evolutionary path not attested in any clade and the expulsion of fire from the throat as a means of removal of excess gas the absence of fossil evidence is traced again to the internal acids which in dickinsons view would dissolve the body soon after death or
asoiaf,not_removed,cold fusion with a gizzard made of palladium
asoiaf,not_removed,magic and dragons seem related so i guess dragons could be embodiments of pyromancy and exude it orally
asoiaf,not_removed,dont the dragons in the show have little tubes on the sides of their mouths
asoiaf,not_removed,one the fire was generated through micronuclear reaction inside dragons body there is a mechanism comprised of hundreds of tiny nano level cells that are not carbon based and can trigger microbial nuclear reaction the energy not only powers dragon to breathe fire they also allow the dragon to fly long distance and recover damage dragon needs to consume both carbon based food like animals and none carbon based food like obsidian to grow big and large and stay healthy some dragons in kings landing died due to he lack of none carbon based food for example the dragons during aegon iii after dragons were removed from dragon pit
asoiaf,not_removed,it is known
asoiaf,not_removed,high protein diets somehow create a flammable substance in their gut giggling
asoiaf,not_removed,or exposed to the the air the dragon blood also burns and melts whatever it touches
asoiaf,not_removed,so kinda like bombardier beetles but through their mouths and more fiery
asoiaf,not_removed,yes i noticed the detail too so you think the fire comes out from those tubes
asoiaf,not_removed,upon reflection i see now that that is pretty much what we create but i was thinking more of a liquid sustance rather than a gas
asoiaf,not_removed,at least a chemical that when exposed to open air creates flames not really sure if they go with gasliquid
asoiaf,not_removed,bloodraven the mountain barry the bold and ser dunk with vhagar the dragon

asoiaf,not_removed,thoros to resurrect dead party members doubles as moderate melee fighter arya for stealth attacks melisandre for offensive magicks sudden death weather spells etc bronn for all around dirty fighter and comic relief rhaegal for more smaller sleeker and more flexible dragon firepower plus stealth he can hang from the ceiling and senses poison attacks i would change out bronn for asha if i get her ship and crew with her to allow more travel options around westeros to gain party members or access advanced dungeons and treasure earlier in the fight
asoiaf,not_removed,daemon the rogue prince arthur dayne daemon blackfyre and aemon the dragonknight daemon bf gets blackfyre dayne gets dawn loophole boyo daemon gets his dragon faster than vhagar and balerion but still pretty big
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis as the leader and strategist with the real lightbringer daemon blackfyre with blackfyre for some good ol melee combat marwyn because hes tough and would also doubles as a healer and mage aegon the conqueror with balerion the black dread because fuck the others

asoiaf,not_removed,why of course it being a jrpg theyll be jon with ghost and longclaw whose first quest is to find bran who rides a hodorlike transport they then find arya in her darkest tsundere moments and redeem her to join the battle when finally dany arrives with the abilty to summon only one of her dragons at a time the three first fight her and then she joins the party tyrion acts as the main character in a managementpolitics minigame where you improve the partys headquarters from stable to fortress inbetween adventures

asoiaf,not_removed,the original azor ahai with the original lightbringer hey he won the first time right twohanded jaime lannister with crippled jaime lannisters wisdom and experience wielding oathkeeper euron crows eye greyjoy wearing valyrian steel plate tyrion lannister wielding the catspaws valyrian steel dagger he lost to littlefinger and riding the dragon whichever one likes tyrion best not as food is my choice
asoiaf,not_removed,those people need to get along and have a diverse set of skills sam tarly hell figure out how to defeat them visenya targaryen the token dragonrider plus her presence ensures that the boys will brush their teeth at least once a week she can also provide obsidian from dragonstone i picked her because shes probably the best female dragon rider slash warrior though im not too happy about her personality arthur dayne selfexplanatory dawn is a bonus garlan tyrell or dragonknight bloodraven would be the obvious choice but i dont like him
asoiaf,not_removed,gregor the warrior great at dying and being a meat shield coldhands the ranger great at dying and scouting enemy positions syrio forel the monkroguedruid he obviously power gamed turned into a raven and flew away p tom the bard music while you bleed and great crowd control vermithor the bronze fury will put in that extra effort to rip another dragons head off
asoiaf,not_removed,chuck norris
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,barristan selmy arthur dayne the mountain and aegon the conquerer
asoiaf,not_removed,since someone mentioned geralt i am making my own wildcard pick wildcard hero of tython from star wars the old republic mmo because he is a great warrior and general who has mastered all seven lightsaber forms to become battlemaster and he is the host of valkorions power jon snow with ghost and longclaw after rlj has been revealed rhaegar targaryen because he knows all about the others and he can finally meet jon arthur dayne the sword in the morning with dawn ameon the dragonknight with dark sister daemon blackfyre with blackfyre samwell tarly because we need someone to research vermithor the bronze fury jons name is probably jaehaerys so it would be fitting to have the dragon of his namesake
asoiaf,not_removed,eh you might need two party slots for that pick
asoiaf,not_removed,lets discuss my payment
asoiaf,not_removed,dont forget hot pie and the last dragon
asoiaf,not_removed,robert baratheon battle of gulltown victory battle at summerhall victory battle at summerhall victory battle at summerhall victory battle of ashford indecisive loss battle of the bells victory battle of the trident victory battle of pyke victory it means that the battle is begun said melisandre the sand is running through the glass more quickly now and mans hour on earth is almost done we must act boldly or all hope is lost westeros must unite beneath her one true king the prince that was promised lord of dragonstone and chosen of rhllor rhllor chooses queerly then the king grimaced as if hed tasted something foul why me and not my brothers renly and his peach in my dreams i see the juice running from his mouth the blood from his throat if he had done his duty by his brother we would have smashed lord tywin a victory even robert could be proud of robert his teeth ground side to side he is in my dreams as well laughing drinking boasting those were the things he was best at those and fighting i never bested him at anything the lord of light should have made robert his champion why me
asoiaf,not_removed,those were the days
asoiaf,not_removed,aegon in the dance of the dragons was pretty decent the trap he had at rooks rest was pretty clever even if it didnt work out and he had a massive comeback as well
asoiaf,not_removed,bloodraven not only is he around for a major part of history hes been pulling the strings almost the entire time he defeated bittersteal and daemon blackfyre led arguably the deadliest fighting force besides dragons in the raventeeth defeated the second daemon pretender before he got a foothold to throw down another rebellion without bloodshed rose to commander of the nights watch before turning his eye on presumably the others however we cant be certain hes not aligned with them at this point which honestly either way you look at it hes moved on the greater fights then the game of thrones with the men alive durning bloodravens prime i also find his victories have a leg up on the current commanders perhaps the first aegon but thats sort or cheating just using dragons to melt armies into submission
asoiaf,not_removed,robert baratheon is often remembered as a drunkard and in many regards a poor king which in many regards he was but i believe he doesnt get the recognition of commander as he should he was fighting a mostly unified kingdom with just his friends and his hammer afterall and deposed a century old dynasty
asoiaf,not_removed,eh out of kingdoms he was only fighing dorne and the reach plus the crownlands he had the north the vale the riverlands the stormlands and castely rock sat on their thumbs till the end the dynasty was already on its last leg aerys and rhaegar were the last two male dragons when there used to be a lot of branches on the family tree
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont recall there ever being a mention of aerys being concerned about the white walkers or winter or any supernatural stuff from what i recall it was just deep insecurity that people would expose him as the terrible leader and king he was cool theory but is there any evidence how would it tie in with the targaryen family history of crazys
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe but then aerys died years before the first white walker reappeared in our story it would make more sense to bug robert with the dreams then again robert was a notorious drunk which reminds me of eggs brother daeron who had dragon dreams and drank himself into a stupor in order to ignore them so maybe they did send dreams to robert and drink was his answer of course the big problem with the theory is that fire doesnt work on white walkers it works on wights so its useful information but it would be more helpful to tell them to use dragon glass and valyrian steel because unless they know how to cut the head off the army the white walkers can continue to raise new wights im not sure if bran or ter know that information youd think the children would have told them but i dont recall if it was ever mentioned in the show
asoiaf,not_removed,im not sure i cant see why bran would do it accidentally in the same way he created hodor and i also cant see why bran or br would do it deliberately theres not much use in warning aerys about the others because he was too long ago it could be that aerys had dragon dreams about the others anyway though that opens up a can of worms about what or who causes dragon dreams but i think the vision is just a mass of different bits of information that bran has to sort out in his mind the deaths of ned cat and robb are not actually that useful for dealing with the others so they are there for padding rlj is more useful as it hints at future roles for jon giving bran a reason to try and influence him through dreams the vision of aerys is useful for the mantra of burn them all the visions of dragons and wildfire are useful because dragonfire and wildfire might be hot enough to burn the others regular fire is good enough for the wights or maybe the visions of wildfire are foreshadowing for the future of kings landing though its difficult to see how bran could prevent that happening
asoiaf,not_removed,yes absolutely
asoiaf,not_removed,he went mad after the defiance of duskendale he felt the city was rebelling against him a la hitler see downfall that being said the books seem to imply that the green sight need wierwood trees while i think their was a godswood in kings landing i dont think aerys spent any time there the show basically gave bran a wall hax
asoiaf,not_removed,there was no mention of hodor being worried about those things either perhaps he only got the burn the enemy part of the vision
asoiaf,not_removed,holy shit george arent you forgetting about something
asoiaf,not_removed,im starting to think i am and other patiently waiting readers are robb stark heading to the red wedding were super jolly about the event although somewhat weary about going into castle the wedding is hope that the next book will be out soon and grrm is bolton ready to slit our throat by producing other related material hes offered us salt and bread with teases of progress but then cuts our direwolfs head off and mounts it on a pike that is wild cards time to move on and do other thingsget back into asoiaf when twow is out but until then im gonna focus on something else
asoiaf,not_removed,wish hed step away from tv and focus on the books wouldnt be surprised if we see a prequel series before he finishes asoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,its like grrm thinks this sub needs more salt or something
asoiaf,not_removed,why am i even waiting for this george forsaken story anymore i should just get over it and move on
asoiaf,not_removed,a dream of spring seems to fit perfectly for the end of asoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,didnt he cancel con visits a year or three ago to work on winds now that seems a pointless gesture
asoiaf,not_removed,wouldnt be stunned if a prequel show premiers on hbo before martin finishes a dream of spring
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know how anyone can even argue writing is his priority anymore his focus is either making as much money as possible or he just wants hbo to finish telling his stories so he doesnt have to i mean forget wild cards thats his baby fine but he just keeps talking to tv suits about more stuff why dunk and egg is like done he cant sell that or can he i hope he isnt over here outlining a show version of roberts rebellion instead of the books
asoiaf,not_removed,i just cant with his notablogevery entry that gets linked here depresses me i cant imagine you pour souls that read it daily
asoiaf,not_removed,gbos wild cards the new series from the maker of a game of thrones
asoiaf,not_removed,i could use some dunk and egg on hbo
asoiaf,not_removed,at this stage can we realistically expect twow before
asoiaf,not_removed,jeez i know its your book to deliver at your own time and that you have a life and can pursue other projects but have some tact and dont rub it in our face man
asoiaf,not_removed,im actually getting annoyed at this point ive always given grrm the benefit of the doubt but this is getting ridiculous he has become a millionaire many times over because of the fans that have paid to read asoiaf he owes it to us to finish the next fucking book already stop working on side projects im done with optimism ive known for years that he will die before the series is finished all ive ever hoped for was twow so that all the cliffhangers we were left with can be resolved nope hell die before releasing it forget ados well never read twow written by grrm in full no fucking way this will go down in history as the most notorious unfinished series of all time that will be your legacy george not the books the world you built or the show that will live on long after youre gone you will be remembered as the man who couldnt complete his signature story im sorry to say but the death of asoif will be mourned more than grrm himself and its coming soon unfortunately
asoiaf,not_removed,i doubt it will be anything dance or predance related dem cgi budgets blackfyre rebellion maybe roberts rebellion most likely
asoiaf,not_removed,didnt martin start writing these books because none of his tv ideas were getting developed is it any surprise that he would let his focus drift like this when everyone in town wants to make the next gots
asoiaf,not_removed,if we get a fevre dream show id be psyched
asoiaf,not_removed,great so hes going to sell yet another unfinished book series to hbo so they can catch up to him before its done get ready for the hbo version of summerhall
asoiaf,not_removed,has to be a prequel series with hbo theres no way theyre letting their flagship show fade away without something else game of thronesrelated taking its place im not sure how involved grrm may be but hell have to play some role if they want to be the slightest bit respectful to the series if its dunk and egg then hes just helping them set up the series if anything else hes still helping outline and possibly writing the dance of dragons or aegons conquest this is because hbo does not want to give up dragons or wolves which theyll likely have to this is why well never see rr
asoiaf,not_removed,fucks sake already
asoiaf,not_removed,a song of ice and fire based off the hit hbo series game of thrones
asoiaf,not_removed,seriouysly
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe hes waiting for this new deal to be signed before he releases wow
asoiaf,not_removed,lol
asoiaf,not_removed,every time i read this blog i say to myself im over it i dont care that hes not writing the books and then it sets in im so sad and i wish i could read new content to cheer me up life is rough lads
asoiaf,not_removed,god fucking damnit
asoiaf,not_removed,in know im supposed to be pissed about twow but im generally excited about more shows from him so long as they are adaptations id love a dunk and egg miniseries or the armageddon rag or even a wildcards show
asoiaf,not_removed,everybody needs to stop panicking just because he says i have lots of stuff in development with hbo doesnt mean hes working on all that right now it could be as simple as a one page treatment he wrote that hbo picked up and are developing a process which takes years grrm is not going to sit down and start writing a brand new pilot or producing a series while hes still working on asoiaf maybe he will spend time reading and editing scripts written by others or providing input to the producers or showrunners tackling these projects in development but hes not dropping everything twow to work on something else of course his top priority is still winds and its wrong and disrespectful to the man to say he hates the books doesnt care about finishing them and has no intention to however hes still allowed a life and other endeavors something hes been doing since hes started writing these books anyway honestly i think we should like the fact he has all these projects while it maybe distract him a little its still good to fuel creativity just look at his mood in the post
asoiaf,not_removed,great a tv show adoptation of asoiaf would be wonderful
asoiaf,not_removed,i look forward to all the fart jokes and brown leather sigils in the de show
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm holy shit i havent talked about wild cards yet today whats wrong with me
asoiaf,not_removed,we see a prequel series before he finishes asoiaf thats a given though i still hope that well have at least twow before any new asoiafrelated hbo project starts
asoiaf,not_removed,the thing so many of you fine folk here are focused on is that george wants to finish the books ive been watching another beloved hbo series band of brothers in one of the episodes blithe gives us a very personable perspective of how terrifying war can be to normal people he asks captain speirs who had gained a reputation as a brave war hero how he does it speirs tells him youre still hoping youre going to live you have to realize youre dead already only after that is he able to function as a soldier youre all still hoping for the books to be finished you have to realize theyre never coming out only then can you function as fantasynovelloving humans in society
asoiaf,not_removed,he makes more money off the show plus the book has all those knots in them this is how the story ends giving foot notes to others and raking in the cash cow
asoiaf,not_removed,if a prequels come out a year or two after got finishes i wouldnt really mind knowing we have around years to go for ados regardless i think it would ease the waiting period but if we get season of the prequels and still no dream
asoiaf,not_removed,hes not going to finish asoiaf because hell never finish ados
asoiaf,not_removed,ya given commercial success of got were absolutely seeing more inuniverse id bet we actually keep seeing them until inevitably we get a crappy spinoff that totally bombs hopefully we get inuniverse miniseries or hbo madefortv movies before then though
asoiaf,not_removed,hes never going to finish asoiaf now the challenge becomes finding another writer after george dies
asoiaf,not_removed,wish hed step away from tv and focus on the books he did that for a season or two actually
asoiaf,not_removed,at this point i think of it as a guarantee unfortunately
asoiaf,not_removed,george makes million per year with hbo hes in no rush for his publishing advance
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,salt ned
asoiaf,not_removed,i come here for the salt baby
asoiaf,not_removed,egg i dreamed that i had no more books
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah but then he canceled con visits in to work on adwd
asoiaf,not_removed,wouldnt be surprised if it came out before the winds of winter
asoiaf,not_removed,if a prequel show ever airs it will be before martin finishes ados because hes never going to finish ados
asoiaf,not_removed,thats pretty much guaranteed at this point even if winds came out yesterday theres no way hes finishing the series in less than five years and hbo will definitely have something out by then
asoiaf,not_removed,i lold
asoiaf,not_removed,dunk and egg is like done he cant sell that or can he sure he can he optioned the rights to asoiaf before the books were done why not do it again
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i mean finishing writing asoiaf clearly isnt the priority anymore i wish it was im sure that he wants to and im sure that he intends to but if you can help it you dont go piling more and more work in front of the thing youd like to do most
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope he isnt over here outlining a show version of roberts rebellion instead of the books youre in luck there martin has said that he considers roberts rebellion to be a part of the main series which is to say by the end of the booksshow we will know enough about the war to make a prequel booktv series about the rebellion pointless hes explicitly said he doesnt want to do that dunk and egg is like done he cant sell that or can he i dont see why not he sold the main series when it was barely halfway done and given that hes even less likely to finish the de stories than the main series he might consider the possibility of doing it via television the de stories are pretty well primed to be a show since you can take a quasianthology approach to it theres no overarching story in the way that there is in the main series its just the story of the lives of two people and the way the novellas are formatted makes it much easier to rearrangeaddsubtract events than it is in the main series if a game of thrones spinoff does happen its hard to believe it would be anything other than dunk and egg
asoiaf,not_removed,the question isnt when but if
asoiaf,not_removed,id love to see timothy spall play good ol abner marsh if that ever came to be
asoiaf,not_removed,if anything else hes still helping outline and possibly writing hell probably be executive producer just like for got he gave up writing episodes for got after to work on twow so i dont think hell be writing for a new show either at least not until twow is done
asoiaf,not_removed,eh hbo spends a lot of danys dragons theyre awesome sure but i doubt not having them would be a deal breaker from hbos perspective
asoiaf,not_removed,i doubt it will be anything dance or predance related dem cgi budgets blackfyre rebellion maybe roberts rebellion most likely
asoiaf,not_removed,then get off this sub
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm is not going to sit down and start writing a brand new pilot or producing a series while hes still working on asoiaf one would have assumed he wasnt going to introduce half a dozen new plotlines and new characters when he was already struggling with story direction either or that he wouldnt let a year head start on the show slip away or that he wouldnt decide to go into business as a theater owner instead of writing
asoiaf,not_removed,translation httpimgurcomgallerytfmca
asoiaf,not_removed,grrm i better spend the day making blog posts about it
asoiaf,not_removed,it aint got no meeranese knots
asoiaf,not_removed,thats so crazy now that i think about it the premier of the next hbo series set in the world of asoiaf will most likely air before george finishes the books
asoiaf,not_removed,i wont be holding my breath
asoiaf,not_removed,a dunk and egg miniseries would make me very happy
asoiaf,not_removed,as a former military man myself i really agree with that approach makes things easier almost calm even during very intense situations
asoiaf,not_removed,if he even allows them after death to touch his work
asoiaf,not_removed,my moneys on doubt hbo would want to go even a year without some asoiaf they have to ride this train while people are still on board
asoiaf,not_removed,because they know better this time
asoiaf,not_removed,except there are no dragons in dunk and egg hbo is definitely going to want dragons
asoiaf,not_removed,he made the comment about bobbys rebellion specifically about the books since the show hasnt really been doing many flashbacks i doubt were going to get enough details about the rebellion in the show to make a prequel series pointless unless they were to dedicate an entire episode to telling that story i just dont see that happening in the show
asoiaf,not_removed,the de stories are pretty well primed to be a show since you can take a quasianthology approach to it i agree it would be neat to meet betha blackwood and see raventree hall the shewolves of winterfell the laughing storm etc
asoiaf,not_removed,we all float down here georgie
asoiaf,not_removed,what if he lets someone else write those blogposts so he can secretly work on twow
asoiaf,not_removed,not really a prequel series could realistically premiere a year or so after season ends meaning the premiere of a new series could potentially be as soon as no one should be expecting ados to be published within the next years
asoiaf,not_removed,the premier of the next next one could very well air before it
asoiaf,not_removed,youd die if you tried
asoiaf,not_removed,if his wraith can stop people from touching his work his wraith can damn well write the rest too stop coddling the undead already
asoiaf,not_removed,this feels like breaking up with a partner after many years together every time i feel like rereading the books going on the forums revisiting some theories i just am reminded that george will never finish this that it will always be unresolved and that honestly makes me really sad ive only been a fan since i guess this is how the first generation of fans felt while they waited for dance
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed or at the latest but with constant reminders trailers and updates throughout to keep the hype alive
asoiaf,not_removed,i do wonder who theyll cast
asoiaf,not_removed,its working out just fine for them though
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe but grrm is making more from the show than his books so if the chance to make even more comes along why not jump at it especially with got ending and fans wanting more they wait a few years for a new show the excitement may not be there gotta strike while the iron is hot and all that
asoiaf,not_removed,better than having the top show on tv and making boatloads of cash
asoiaf,not_removed,nor tits particularly it seems to me admittedly ive only read the hedge knight but it seems really wholesome compared to asoiaf propernot that theres anything wrong with that
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know about that apparently danys three eat up an enormous amount of the budget on got really the only two stories you could do with dragons would be aegons conquest and the dance theres no way theyd do the latter if danys three are breaking the bank theres no way theyre going to commit to a premise that requires two dozen and theres really not enough to aegons conquest to build a show around it
asoiaf,not_removed,make that two orders of dragons please
asoiaf,not_removed,and titties
asoiaf,not_removed,theres literally no reason for the spin off not to be aegons conquest tbh
asoiaf,not_removed,we wont get as much of it on the show as in the books youre right but martins said he doesnt want to do it and they need his go ahead for it so i dont see it happening i mean a dump truck full of money could change his mind but generally speaking money doesnt seem like his driving concern to my mind de would be a smarter choice for hbo regardless of what martin wants for starters it would be way cheaper also i feel doing a second show about a continentspanning war will only suffer in comparison to the original de is kind of perfect in that its clearly set in the same world and can work within the same genre but allows you to do something new and different
asoiaf,not_removed,indeed i can see why people think hbo would want roberts rebellion hey did you dig ned stark and robert baratheon and tywin lannister on game of thrones were you sad when they got killed off well heres younger sexier versions of them fighting danys crazy father and weird brother that youve heard so much about but rather than doing another war story that has the added boondoggle of a forgone conclusion i think jumping back years and having new characters from houses that we recognize that can be contrasted with characters from the main series is the smarter move it scratches a similar itch but leaves you way way more breathing room to do different stuff
asoiaf,not_removed,its not the years its the entire run of game of thrones and now another show coming out before he could write books
asoiaf,not_removed,unless theyve already decided on a concept and are starting to hire people to work on it i would expect at least years between season and any prequel it takes longer to develop a new show than it does to produce a season of an existing show however ados is unlikely before a prequel even if there is a year gap so the prequel will probably be first regardless
asoiaf,not_removed,i could be wrong but im guessing that without the books its way harder for dd to finish it in a good way on the other hand they already got their money the end isnt important for a tv show when it comes to money
asoiaf,not_removed,people love tits and dragons and stentorian actors westworld has tits stentorian actors and robots you have to have something besides tits to get people to watch
asoiaf,not_removed,but martins said he doesnt want to do it and they need his go ahead for it depending how the contracts were worded that may not necessarily be the case if hbo bought the rights to the asoiaf series with a blanket development deal for television works based on the series they dont need georges blessing for roberts rebellion
asoiaf,not_removed,plus with des smaller scope the showrunners will be able to really amp up the quality of the locations and props to make them as incredible as in the books instead of six different storylines with six different massive set pieces per episode theyll be able to put all of their effort into one at a time
asoiaf,not_removed,at this point got might complete its entire run before he gets twow out
asoiaf,not_removed,one book
asoiaf,not_removed,before the show started he had books out and theres a good chance there will be a total of books done before the show ends with at least some progress made for the final book as well with how large and complex these books are again i dont think anyone should have reasonably expected him to publish of these books in a span of years
asoiaf,not_removed,but it wont be dd at the helm so hbo could have both productions running simultaneously
asoiaf,not_removed,hes specifically stated that he doesnt want anyone else to build on the westeros universe but him
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its easier for them because george gave them an outline and they can simply do what they want instead of trying to make it just like the books regardless the point is season was in many peoples opinion the best season and it was mostly post book material so i doubt they care much that the other books are not done as long as they get the broad strokes of the story
asoiaf,not_removed,nah martin locked the rights so that they can only utilize roberts rebellion as its presented in the books so the tower of joy robert vs rhaegar on the trident jaime killing aerys they cant invent new lines scenes characters anything that would be required to develop it into an actual show
asoiaf,not_removed,i would say its it depends on how much the publisher screams and threatens i would say if i was a betting man
asoiaf,not_removed,he published in years so its not asking a lot to expect books in double that time
asoiaf,not_removed,sweet summer child
asoiaf,not_removed,yes maybe youre right in terms of production value action funny scenes etc sure it was a good season but imho it lacked what made the other seasons good the story for me was always a slow burner where things making sense was a priority regardless of who was killed or what happened it was more like reading a history book and that made it good the last season focused more on shocking scenes ramsay as a supervillain jokes and khaleese is so badass its just not what i liked about the story even though i can understand the appeal in badassdom so if it continues like this my guess is that the show will be forgotten in a few years because its just another formulaic fantasy show
asoiaf,not_removed,do you have a source for that i know hes said they only licensed the main books but ive never heard anything more restrictive than that
asoiaf,not_removed,there was a great post on this sub arguing in beautiful detail what many of us have suspected for some time the publisher and editor lost control of george some time ago i dont think he really wants to finish the series at this point i know every george fanboy will nansplain to me in great detail how the books are soooooooo complex that years and years and years of sortofwriting are necessary he now wastes massive amounts of time doing all sorts of superfluous nonsense such as attending five trillion conferences that he does not need to attend while the television show is finishing the series he once considered his great work
asoiaf,not_removed,publisher what can they do grrms paycheck comes from hbo and everywhere else publisher cant do crap to him
asoiaf,not_removed,the books have gotten considerably more complicated since then not to mention the fact that grrm originally intended the first three books to be one single book by the time agot was published hed already had most of acok and a decent chunk of asos finished he also started writing these books in the early and they werent published until the late and early so its not like he flew threw the first three books he definitely wrote them faster than the later but he did not write them nearly as fast as the publishing dates make it seem
asoiaf,not_removed,promise me grrm promise me
asoiaf,not_removed,eh that feels like a different kind of promise though at least the way i see it
asoiaf,not_removed,by adam whitehead a prominent fantasy blogger who knows martin personally in the past hes also cited by the guy who runs titancon who also has professional relationships with both martin and hbo
asoiaf,not_removed,nansplaining brilliant
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah ive accepted the fact that hes given up on finishing the series its blatantly obvious at this point
asoiaf,not_removed,i would like to read this article if you have a link
asoiaf,not_removed,it depends on his contract theyre not his main source of income but he may have a legal obligation to deliver the final manuscript by a certain date if the timing works out they could choose not to push the date back yet again to make sure its out before the show ends then its up to george to get it to them or possibly face consequences for not delivering on his end of the contract
asoiaf,not_removed,the books have gotten considerably more complicated since then even if they haveand agot through asos are pretty complicatedits only because of martins decisions adding a trillion new plotlines he definitely wrote them faster than the later but he did not write them nearly as fast as the publishing dates make it seem although he had the original idea for the bran chapter that spawned the whole story in he didnt really start writing in earnest until after doorways was turned down so he still did agot plus whatever he had left over of acok in two years
asoiaf,not_removed,not to mention the fact that grrm originally intended the first three books to be one single book nope the first run of the first book mentioned a trilogy its book where he made it a book series if i recall its been a while duh
asoiaf,not_removed,hbo has already built on the westeros universe so i am reeeaaallly not convinced that george has some kind of special idea about westeros that its virgin flesh cant be touched by anyone but him obviously hbo has moved well beyond the books now in terms of storyline of course and also in terms of confirming certain fan favorite theories i tend to agree with others who at this point given how george has no real pressures left that he will not finish the series by season eight of the show that he will never finish it i just dont think he has the passion for it anymore i also think it just became too big and that can be psychologically overwhelming hbo has already built on the westeros universe so i am reeeaaallly not convinced that george has some kind of special idea about westeros that its virgin flesh cant be touched by anyone but him obviously hbo has moved well beyond the books now in terms of storyline of course and also in terms of confirming certain fan favorite theories i tend to agree with others who at this point given how george has no real pressures left as he will not finish the series by season eight of the show that he will never finish it i just dont think he has the passion for it anymore i also think it just became too big and that can be psychologically overwhelming
asoiaf,not_removed,adding a trillion new plotlines and just expecting himself to remember all of the intricate details of each one you would expect a guy who creates so much would have extensive notes and documentation but its easier to just let that garden grow
asoiaf,not_removed,in the original outline the first book of the trilogy ended at the red wedding meaning that he basically only got to the end of the planned first book by asos
asoiaf,not_removed,a little late to the party there but yes thats what they are for
asoiaf,not_removed,would certainly be ironic if tyrion turns out to be the only trueborn son of tywin
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont buy it primarily because i like the idea that all of tywins children are a total fucking disaster in his eyes except for perfect jaime who is the only one of the three who doesnt want power i like that irony and those family dynamics which only work if theyre tywins childrens also i think its kind of unrealistic for george to make everyone targaryen bastards who just so happen to not have inherited any of the features its believable with jon but wouldnt have been if it happened to everyone edit just wanted to add that i believe that george is trying to parallel cersei to aerys but i think its significance is the irony that she thinks of herself as a female tywin her fathers true heir the lannister lioness while shes proving as unfit a ruler as the man her father told to fuck off all those years ago
asoiaf,not_removed,bullshit you want a secret targaryen jon there done thats all you get
asoiaf,not_removed,i hate both of the lannister targ theories they seem too convenient of a twist for grrm to throw in there it also cheapens all of their relationships with tywin besides weve had enough or alleged targaryens weve met in the series considering they are supposedly an extinct line
asoiaf,not_removed,poor narrative in my opinion
asoiaf,not_removed,while there seems to be some textual evidence to suggest this many of you had made a compelling case on here i really dont think that its the case
asoiaf,not_removed,well since the timeline matches up i could buy it if grrm put it in only because of how much joffrey and cersei act like targaryens love of fire cruelty complete idiots
asoiaf,not_removed,i think that there is enough secret targs thank you
asoiaf,not_removed,its shit because there is no need in such reveal it has nothing to do with what their story is about and we dont need more secret targaryens
asoiaf,not_removed,it has always been one of the still not confirmed theory in which i personally believe the most even though i like to think that there can only be one secret targaryen in the story and given that somebody isnt very often you see people believing tyrion is a targaryen and together with another targs jon and dany he will ride a dragon but thats totally bs for many reasons included martin repeating in the years that you dont need to be targaryen to ride a dragon
asoiaf,not_removed,i would prefer it to tyrion targaryen just because it would be wonderfully ironic unfortunately nobody has really tried to come up with any plot important reason for it
asoiaf,not_removed,i like the thematics of the kids being products of aerys i think they all have traits that make them similar to targs tyrion will ride a dragon mainly because of his knowledge instead of magic blood similar to nettles id prefer if jon is the only confirmed secret targ since its a case where only the first lightning strike will work
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe it to be true that tyrion is tywins son it would explain why cj can sit the iron throne when it has denied others maegor i think this would be validated if faegon sits on the throne and is killed by it
asoiaf,not_removed,no aside from it being not great storytelling it was debunked by woiaf jons the secret targ in the story and aegon might be a secret blackfyre thats about it
asoiaf,not_removed,spoilers in the headline i see let me go get my popcorn
asoiaf,not_removed,no
asoiaf,not_removed,i kind of want it to be true just for that tywin has been known to ignore truths he didnt like maybe he just found tyrion easier to hate
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its more ironic if tyrion hill is the true son of tywin while his genetic children are nothing like him at least to tywin
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe the lanisters have some mad blood in them as well the comparisons between cersei and the mad king fasinate me even if she isnt his daughter there are similarities between their characters paranoia mainly
asoiaf,not_removed,there isnt much evidence but aurane waters could be a secret targ all speculation here but when cersei first meets aurane she thinks shes seeing rhaegar on second glance she sees many discrepancies but is still a bit surprised by how similarly aurane looks to rhaegar now we know characters have been mistaken for others before such as gendry when brienne thinks of renly to be fair though ned has the same though of renly when he sees him it is possible that with the velaryion blood aurane just happens to look like rhaegar but stili dont recall joncon describing faegon as rhaegar reborn age aurane was born or sowhich would have made rhaegar so age wise it is possible but how well rhaegar was prince of dragonstone he would have visited the island a few times the master of ships was lucheys velaryionrhaegar would have taken one of these ships maybe a daughter sister cousin had an affair with rhaegar on one of these trips if she did get pregnant with rhaegar i think it would have been easy to hide her on driftmark of course there just isnt enough evidence this is only speculation suppose its true thoughit would make the azor ahai prophecy cleaner aurane sword that broke in water aegon sword that broke by lion jon sword that became lightbringer then theres the three headed dragondany jon and aurane a fun tidbit i thought it was weird that aurane had feminine name so i used word scrambler to see if there were any interesting words in his name rune stuck out to methe word means secret in old english
asoiaf,not_removed,i think it would work well for their stories for the twins especially because cersei is so obsessed with becoming tywin her father while shes being like aerys her theory father doesnt do much for jaime but i think it would really screw up tyrions story it also makes joffery much lamer it would mean that joffrey was a crazy generation full blood targaryan i really like the story right now where people are just cruel sometimes where it happens to any bloodline
asoiaf,not_removed,the real question is though can either of them sing
asoiaf,not_removed,the timeline does not match up for jaime and cersei it only fits for tyrion
asoiaf,not_removed,you must a secret targ only a secret targ would try to reduce the number of rivals
asoiaf,not_removed,nightssss kiiiiing ice dragon
asoiaf,not_removed,it would make jaime ok with tyrion killing his dad since he did the same to tyrion boom i finished twow for ya jk i really dont think there could be a plot around it at this point since everyone involved is dead
asoiaf,not_removed,dragon rider theory is absolute bs you know what will happen atleast one dragon will die that will happen
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont know why anybody cares
asoiaf,not_removed,how is that a spoiler
asoiaf,not_removed,aye
asoiaf,not_removed,she doesnt need any specific bloodline to be terrible ruler as well as joffrey doesnt need to be incest kid to be a stupid cruel spoiled brat i dont like when people excuse character development with genetics or destiny hell no those people think and make choices sometimes good sometimes bad cersei have many reasons to be terrible ruler and turn into psycho she was never taught how to do politics yet she tries because of her lack of abilities she constantly fails but is too narcistic to admit it to herself so she decepts herself that its not her fault but the people around her stupid cowardly and unfaithful she becomes more and more hateful towards her subjects so she doesnt try to win them over nor make up her mind taking them in concern treating them cruelly and making their lives her resource instead and joffreys upbringing is just a natural consequence of cerseis worldview hes not monster from his birth hes just terribly twisted by his mothers life lessons
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree completely but like i said i think its got more to do with cerseis strive to become tywin and failing miserably and thus becoming tywins inept and mad couterpart than an actual blood bond with aerys
asoiaf,not_removed,as you say cersei later notes that its only auranes hair that is truly resembles a feature of rhaegars not to mention the velaryons are descended from valyria as well have long been virtually a cadet branch of the targaryens they look like the targs more than any other house in westeros aurane has a passing resemblance to rhaegar because of centuries of intermarriage but nothing more theres no indication that rhaegar slept with anybody besides elia lyanna unlike his father lucerys was most likely the father of monford so also aurane rhaegar wouldve had his own ships as prince of dragonstone jorah had his own even before he married lynesse and lucerys was one of top sycophants if there was anything that arose suspicion of rhaegar with a female velaryon or not he wouldve brought it to aerys and why would he raise a bastard of rhaegars whose existence wouldve alone devalued the marriageability of his mother frankly there is no evidence the speculation isnt exactly topnotch
asoiaf,not_removed,aurane waters isnt popular enough to not only be a targ bastard but rhaegars too away with this s ive thought about this too i dont think its likely its possible i think but not very likely sometimes people just tend to have bastards and sometimes close relatives what the targs and velaryons certainly are tend to look pretty similar aurane as a dragonrider would be fun i mean he is a looker pro for dany has the important valyrian blood currently leads a nice fleet and as a velaryon given hed legitimize himself as pirate king and that legitimization being recognized by queen daenerys has the name to bone dany a fun theory but aurane is overall too minor to fill such a role imo
asoiaf,not_removed,aurane sword that broke in water aegon sword that broke by lion jon sword that became lightbringer i do not understand any of what you wrote here
asoiaf,not_removed,sing
asoiaf,not_removed,ahhh yes it does rhaella dismissed her from court citing that she didnt like aerys turning my ladies into his whores she was pregnant when she was sent back to the rock we know this because tywin was still in kings landing serving as aerys hand he didnt return to the rock until his father died
asoiaf,not_removed,what if we turn possible secret targs into secret lannisters and starks or even into secret white walkers
asoiaf,not_removed,i think all three will be dead with only eggs remaining in the snow
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont nessisarily agree with the theory i only like it for the irony of tyrion being the legitimate son while jamie and cersei are the bastards i wonder if the fact that cersei is a woman and therefore the modern equivilant of a really pretty car may have something to do with it she was kind of fucked over politcally literally and culturally that and she does keep saying that she was tywins only true son so maybe shes tywin as a female tywin who had no power no authority and had to resort to cheap tricks to get what she wanted
asoiaf,not_removed,its a reference to the azor ahai legend precisely the attempts at forging lightbringer
asoiaf,not_removed,sorry sleep deprived that was an attempt at comparing them to rhaegar but upon further inspection i can see it was really lame and made no sense insomnia its a bitch
asoiaf,not_removed,joanna was not pregnant when was dismissed from court rhaella sent her away not long after she wed tywin in there were rumors that aerys had slept with her during the bedding so we can reasonably conclude that joanna left between and she gave birth to the twins in at casterly rock edit imagine the scandal if joanna was pregnant when she left kings landing people had already suspected aerys was sleeping with her
asoiaf,not_removed,i think cersei has some deeply internalized misogyny that she doesnt know how to deal with the whole twin situation doesnt help she constantly thinks about how jaime and her were born as equals how people couldnt tell them apart until she blossomed into a woman and then everything was ruined he started to get all the education of a warrior and a ruler while she had to smile and nod thats a big hit because she always saw herself as his complete equal so as an adult she still struggles with the thought that she should have been born a man ive said this before in other comments but i believe the reason jaime and cersei have their incestual relationship comes from cerseis need to consume him to become him control him at least from her it has nothing to do with love and everything to do with feeling empowered i think cerseis thougths while she fingers taena merrywheather support this view
asoiaf,not_removed,sword that broke in water aegon
asoiaf,not_removed,well jaime certainly sings much to briennes chagrin cant say anything about cersei or joffrey though
asoiaf,not_removed,we are told that joanna visited the capital after rhaella sent her away we are told that she seldom visited but seldom and never are different things she had to get pregnant by someone after all and tywin was in kings landing it isnt unreasonable to think that on one of joannas visits aerys raped her tywin may or may not have known but if she just randomly was pregnant after not seeing her husband for two years that would be a bit odd
asoiaf,not_removed,that is a really fucked up view of their relationship but it sort of makes sense in a borderline horror movie kind of way i know she says it but none of her actions really show love
asoiaf,not_removed,aegon broke by lion apparently
asoiaf,not_removed,joffrey tried to sing once but he choked
asoiaf,not_removed,as you said she was pregnant when she was dismissed but thats not true there is only a small time frame between her dismissal and the birth of jaime and cersei i highly doubt she dared to visit the capital during that time especially when you consider rhaella had suffered a string of miscarriages and aerys was particularly dedicated to his wife during this time however all the seldom moments are accounted for and they take place after the birth of the twins we know for a fact she was in kings landing in for the anniversary tourney she then gave birth to tyrion in so the timeline doesnt work for jaime and cersei but it does for tyrion
asoiaf,not_removed,it wasnt joanna who visited tywin in kl it was tywin who was visiting cr quite often
asoiaf,not_removed,so instead of his wife going back and forth the hand of the king took breaks from running the kingdom to go home thats a trip of several months
asoiaf,not_removed,it took month for robert and all the people he took with him to travel from kl to winterfell and thats including the many stops he made on his way so no tywins trips to cr wouldnt have taken several months also considering that tywin was a hand of the king for the entirety of his marriage with joanna from the wedding till her death if tywin was always in kg at that time the phrase tywin ruled the seven kingdoms but was ruled at home by his lady wife wouldnt have existed but as it does tywin had to visit his home and quite a lot
asoiaf,not_removed,no doesnt even have baelor aka the most important episode to series lore
asoiaf,not_removed,hi there your link has been removed for having an incorrect spoiler scope though i understand your intent of not wanting people to give away some of the story for you the content in the link you shared is inherently not because it gives away some plot points if you like please feel free to repost your link and question with a spoiler scope of let me know if you have any questions
asoiaf,not_removed,me too i was upset at how much history and knowledge we could have gotten from the character it seems as though right before his death he really had the ptwp prophecy down pact
asoiaf,not_removed,i so badly wanted aemon to meet daenerys it was never going to happen but it would have meant the world to them both
asoiaf,not_removed,i enjoyed aemon but for sam to really continue his story arch it needed to happen
asoiaf,not_removed,ill be honest i got all teary at egg i dreamed i was old thinking those were his last words and then he stayed alive for another couple of chapters and i felt kinda awkward for getting emotional
asoiaf,not_removed,its also irritating that he could have been a source for information on summerhall
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe im a cold hearted monster but i didnt care that much
asoiaf,not_removed,it hit me hard because ive lost family to alzheimer and dementia grrm did a great portrayal of how much it hurts watching someone go through that
asoiaf,not_removed,i wasnt sad that coward ducking his responsibilities is the reason why the mad king got the crown and set all of westeros into chaos
asoiaf,not_removed,same here i was holding out for that and was really sad when he died
asoiaf,not_removed,that was a dragonlevel burn right there
asoiaf,not_removed,but aemon had also taken the vows of a maester its one of those dilemmas we see a lot in the story what should come first loyalty to ones older brother or ones king stanniss dilemma in roberts rebellion is a kingsguard obligated to kill his own father the mad king ordered jaime to do so when tywin sacked kings landing you can see it as a convenient excuse and its true that aemon doesnt seem like the type to willingly take up power but i also like to think that the maesters vows meant a great deal to aemon and not even a crown could tempt him to break them and anyway if you look at canon your point doesnt really stand at all aemon ceded the crown to his younger brother aegon v who was a just king and champion of the smallfolk no one could have forseen his untimely death at summerhall even then in the book canon aegon v was succeeded by his second son and heir jaehaerys ii after his first son duncan gave up the throne for love who was the father of aerys ii who began his reign promisingly enough charismatic if not particularly bright and only went full out mad after apparently being triggered by his imprisonment at duskendale the show makes aerys ii the son of aegon v eliminating a generation though thats not really important in any case you really cant blame aemon for all the unpredictable events that ended up giving westeros the mad king
asoiaf,not_removed,i think he refused the crown because he too was waiting for the prince that was promised
asoiaf,not_removed,qhorin halfhand is arthur dayne daenarys is jons twin daenerys is lyannas child born in the tower of joy melisandre is shiera seastar quaithe is daenerys from the future quaithe is shiera seastar quaithe is melisandre quaithe is ashara dayne
asoiaf,not_removed,strong belwas is king robert tyrion is daenerys malformed son rhaego and therefore the stallion that mounts the world
asoiaf,not_removed,not a subscriber to all these necessarily but ive also seen arthur dayne is mance rayder arthur dayne is qhorin halfhand oswell whent is oswell kettleblack oswell whent is qhorin halfhand gerold hightower is tormund lewyn martell is the elder brother harwin is the hooded man wenda the white fawn of the kingswood brotherhood is septa lemore bran the builder is the night king bran is every brandon
asoiaf,not_removed,ser byron is tyrek lannister is he though stay tuned mance rayder is the son of jenny of oldstones and duncan the small jyana reed is the daughtergrandaughter of jenny of oldstone and duncan the small probably mances daughter or ashara dayne but probably the former oswell k is oswell whent the kettleblack boys are lord walter whents sons qhorin halfhand is gerold hightower septa lemore is malora hightower haldon halfmaester is lord leyton hightower obara is not oberyns daughter shes either lewyns or marwyns jaime and cersei are aeryss bastard twins raegon iswas the bastard son of arthur dayne and elia martell varys and saera were their children edit bonus quaithe is rhaella guaranteed jon is dany is bronn is oh so many more to come
asoiaf,not_removed,howland reed is arthur dayne wait what
asoiaf,not_removed,here are a few that occurred to me tryion lannister is actually tyrion targaryen or a targaryen bastard tyrion lannister is rhaego the timetraveling fetus cersei and jaime are targaryen bastards aegon vi is illyrios son aegon vi is the pisswater prince arya is nymeria controlling aryas body lem lemoncloak is ser richard lonmouth skahaz mo kandaq is the harpy reznak mo reznak is the harpy galazza galare is the harpy the elder brother is rhaegar one or both of those millers boys was really theons bastard son maege mormont is the bear tormund was husband to
asoiaf,not_removed,rhaegar is the harp playing monk on the quiet isle
asoiaf,not_removed,howland reed is the mad mouse
asoiaf,not_removed,these are always fun but my favorites are roose being a vampire and varys being a merman oh yeah i almost forgot dany being the daughter of ned and ashara dayne
asoiaf,not_removed,domeric bolton is mandon moore littlefinger is a rayne the huntsman is aegon frey the bloodborn quaithe is joanna lannister darkstar is jaehaerys the supposed dead son of aerys daenerys is a bastard born from aerys raping ashara dayne alleras the sphynx is sarella sand obv aurane waters is the pirate king old nan is rohanne webber old nan is shiera seastar old nan is danelle lothston thats everything that came to my mind immediately
asoiaf,not_removed,ser shadrich being howland reed is one of the more likely of these didnt see it posted anywhere
asoiaf,not_removed,the super theory of asoiaf secret identities states that all of the pov characters are secret targaryens except dany whos a secret dayne all of the none pov characters are faceless men
asoiaf,not_removed,some of these are almost certainly true ser robert strong is the mountain the gravedigger is the hound pate is jaqen hghar others are at least as likely to be true as false aegon is a blackfyre or brightflame or someone other than the son of elia and rhaegar varys is a blackfyre or brightflame or somehow related to aegon also there are two distinct categories of secret identities those that contradict what weve been told ie daario is euron those who are presented as mysteries such as quaithe the hooded man lem lemoncload the mad mouse and especially septa lemore who comes right and says lemore gave him a reproachful look that is because you have a wicked soul septas robes scream of westeros and might draw unwelcome eyes onto us she turned back to prince aegon you are not the only one who must needs hide with this second group were supposed to put on tinfoil hats and guess and we feel we have a right to get the answer eventually with the first group too many of these switches and one might say the author is dancing on rotten ice a quote from a
asoiaf,not_removed,varys is a merman
asoiaf,not_removed,faegon is neds
asoiaf,not_removed,ive seen suggestions that septa lemore could be malora hightower

asoiaf,not_removed,i forgot jamie cersei andor tyrion being secret targaeryns that ones everybodys favourite theory right right guys
asoiaf,not_removed,lyanna is wylla ashara was jons wetnurse
asoiaf,not_removed,heres one i actually think is quite plausible
asoiaf,not_removed,mance is arthur dayne qhorin halfhand is oswell whent everyone says mance is rheagar but if you read jon iv in adwd specifically the duel between mance glamored as rattleshirt and jon rattlemance specifically asks for a greatsword then proceeds to destroy jon wielding the blade with lighting speed can rheagar wield a greatsword that well can a wildling how about ser arthur dayne the sword of the mourning only one man in the story can wield a greatsword with ridiculous grace and speed and that would be arthur
asoiaf,not_removed,does count as a secret identity

asoiaf,not_removed,timmett son of timmett vale heir
asoiaf,not_removed,okay i have one tyrion is actually the son of cersei and jamie this is purely based on the strange things cersei says about tyrion being hers hes mine i can do what i like we know that joanna caught them playing together and banished them to opposite sides of the castle what if cersei was pregnant and gave birth to tyrion joanna pretends to be pregnant to cover it up and is willing to raise the child as hers in medieval times couples wouldnt have sex during pregnancy so she could theoretically have concealed this from tywin however when the baby is born and its deformed she refuses to claim it as hers and threatens to tell twyin cersei panics and kills her in her narcissistic mind this becomes tyrions fault for being deformed thus forcing cersei to kill her to keep the incest a secret jamie wouldnt know anything about it as hes been separated from cersei and sleeping in different quarters
asoiaf,not_removed,qhorin halfhand is gerold hightower
asoiaf,not_removed,you mean eurondaariobenjenjaqen hgarkindly mansyrio forel
asoiaf,not_removed,hot pie is not a bakers son but actually the son of another member of neds entourage who was also killed during the massacre just like arya he assumes a pseudonym to avoid detection which is why we never learn his real name
asoiaf,not_removed,allyria dayne is asharas stillborn daughter meera and jojen are howland and asharas children are a couple others
asoiaf,not_removed,i didnt see it but i like the theory that gerion lannister is the shrouded lord it goes a long way to explain why he would have chosen to spare tyrion of greyscale but not joncon

asoiaf,not_removed,has anybody else heard that ben might be glory
asoiaf,not_removed,no no pfft brother in law maybe but not wife unlikely strong possibility nope no matter how entertaining it is no shit all but spelled out in the book um what possible but unclear nah yes fuck no no no but howland stabbed arthur dayne in the back to prevent dayne from killing ned in battle its possible but im not really convinced that its probable no bloodraven chose the imagery of the three eyed crow to get through to bran starks greenseer ability he may have also used it with euron greyjoy and fucked that up likely but he doesnt know it that kid genuinely believes he is aegon targaryen son of rhaegar targaryen and elia martell oh ffs people no no no
asoiaf,not_removed,i forgot all the quaithe theories
asoiaf,not_removed,no no no unlikely no possible no no and as for quaithe is rhaella targaryen no
asoiaf,not_removed,septa lemore is shiera seastarblackfyre ties

asoiaf,not_removed,bran is the red god seems fit to tack onto your list
asoiaf,not_removed,why do people think arthur dayne isnt dead
asoiaf,not_removed,why is haldon halfmaester leyton and not humfrey hightower humfrey was sent by leyton to the free cities so we know hes in essos so if lemore is malora it would be a brother and sister together sent on a mission by their father
asoiaf,not_removed,id never seen those elder brother theories before i like them a lot thanks for posting this list btw
asoiaf,not_removed,mance rayder is the son of jenny of oldstones and duncan the small any more on this one
asoiaf,not_removed,there are threads on it no it still doesnt make any sense
asoiaf,not_removed,except ya know with a knife
asoiaf,not_removed,some of this are really well known surprised they werent in the main post arya is nymeria controlling aryas body we can actually read aryas thoughts some people are just bored
asoiaf,not_removed,more sense than him being the high sparrow
asoiaf,not_removed,nope
asoiaf,not_removed,roose being a vampire bolton is such a good theory i want to believe
asoiaf,not_removed,is it too much to hope this turns out true
asoiaf,not_removed,oh and that varys is a brightflame decendent the most likely varys identity imo
asoiaf,not_removed,darkstar is jaehaerys is a favorite

asoiaf,not_removed,bonus bonus khal drogo is aquaman jason mamoa played both
asoiaf,not_removed,holy crap man
asoiaf,not_removed,make a post about this man its good tinfoil heck it even seems likely
asoiaf,not_removed,according to the woiaf cersei was born in and tyrion in cersei would have needed to be at the oldest when she conceived even though it is technically possible that seems like a stretch
asoiaf,not_removed,she ate her own father incest is a lannister thing not a stark thing
asoiaf,not_removed,i didnt say likely theories did i
asoiaf,not_removed,no but howland stabbed arthur dayne in the back to prevent dayne from killing ned in battle that only happened in the show still there are many more reasons for why that theory doesnt work
asoiaf,not_removed,balerion the cat the scruffy black one arya kept trying to catch is rhaenys targaryen sir pounce is tptwp
asoiaf,not_removed,quaithe is ashara dayne i will go down with this theory its literally the oldest one ive ever had for the series thats never been confirmed baby
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,because toj is so vague and cryptic
asoiaf,not_removed,haldons been with the gang a long time humphrey just left leytons been in his tower a long time the exact right amount of time actually the names reference one another too don and ton are essentially homonyms in context hal reversed lah lahdon lehton
asoiaf,not_removed,hes jon darry imo
asoiaf,not_removed,glad you dug em to be fair ive shifted more towards marwyn being tyrions halfdaddy but the basic idea is all the same i kinda like joanna becoming lewyns paramour after his knights daughter gets killed since shes a silent sister it ties into why hes hiding whereas he is
asoiaf,not_removed,cantuses i think makes perfect sense i think hes absolutely right the singingsongsbarding ending up north of the wall postsummerhall bloodraven connection brought up there by dunk aka coldhands etc
asoiaf,not_removed,agreed or house bolton is descendants from the children of the nights king or something
asoiaf,not_removed,it didnt make that much sense when i read it tbh
asoiaf,not_removed,everyones always picking on jon
asoiaf,not_removed,ahh yeah that was the main problem with my tinfoil
asoiaf,not_removed,only happened in the show ned explicitly says that without howland he would have died in dorne the show gives a reasonable and highly probable demonstration of this and i dont think we can discount this as a show only event i think its highly highly probable that this is exactly what happened in grrms plans too
asoiaf,not_removed,balerion the cat the scruffy black one arya kept trying to catch is rhaenys targaryens former kitten yes when modified sir pounce is tptwp it is known
asoiaf,not_removed,balerion the cat is aerys targaryen
asoiaf,not_removed,all the evidence i need
asoiaf,not_removed,say no more
asoiaf,not_removed,if the quiet isles gang are faceless men maybe jaqen is from their crew
asoiaf,not_removed,i like this one only discovered it recently heres a link
asoiaf,not_removed,excuse you but azor ahai is none else but hot pie
asoiaf,not_removed,no more
asoiaf,not_removed,i really really struggle with jaqen and the factionalization of the faceless men like is jaqen totally rogue or just part of a faction with the hobw ditto the quiet isle
asoiaf,not_removed,yup thats the one
asoiaf,not_removed,ayeaye hot pie for azor ahai
asoiaf,not_removed,if they have their own sect it would make sense jaqen is so queer compared to the bravos sect if he were a part of it
asoiaf,not_removed,and on the hundredth day when he finally had the perfect ingredients he forged the perfect hot pie foodbabybringer it was called and he called his beloved nestlenestle to him and slapped it down her soupcooler while it was all hot and stuff from the oven
asoiaf,not_removed,daenerys is the one born amidst salt and smoke the dragons prove it maester aemon i dont think that this is a thing i dont believe that dragons needs to be present to the person to be tptwp i think theres more interpretation needed than that nice post though i enjoyed it tips imaginary tinfoil hat
asoiaf,not_removed,nice post but isnt azor ahai supposed to be born from salt and smoke why eurons attack against oldtown would be considered as being born or reborn i guess you could say he could be reborn after conquering the city or displaying some big action over there but still who would worship him as aa the red priests faith who he constantly mocks and torture the lords of the south the small folk theres also the fact that tptwp includes lightbinder a sacrifice and more importantly it does not per se includes dragons nor a red comet but lets asume it does if it were in fact a red comet why would it be the hightower instead of the actual red comet that appeared in the sky and everybody in planetos saw and talked about between got and cok and this leads to my final question if euron actualy gains control over one of danys dragons why would he care to fullfil the profecy of aa or tptwp wouldnt getting a dragon be the real thing
asoiaf,not_removed,but another and very vital part of the prophecy is that azor ahai must have the blood of aerys and rhaella targaryen according to a woods witch ser barristan says that aerys and rhaella targaryen married because a woods witch said that tptwp would be of their line the description of the woods witch matches the description of the ghost of high heart who already proved the accuracy of her predictions by predicting a bunch of other stuff that already came true so this is an essential part melisandre gets a little more specific than aemon in her version of the prophecy azor ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone there are also other signs of azor ahai other than the star salt smoke stone dragons and blood lightbringer and a sacrifice are the two others the sacrifice could be involved in the creation of lightbringer or the awakening of the dragons since the prophecy is full of mistranslations
asoiaf,not_removed,i hope not tbh eurons single redeeming feature is that he appears to see through all the talk of gods
asoiaf,not_removed,ehhhtptwp is supposed to wake dragons from stone and melisandre says that only kings blood can wake dragons from stone meanwhile daenerys hatches dragons from stone eggs in a kings funeral pyre i understand prophecies can be finicky but this just seems like ignoring the obvious
asoiaf,not_removed,why thank you for the hat tip i dont think they are really needed for it either but imo euron does seem like the kind of person who would want a dragon to truly make him a god in appearance i never really thought much of euron until i read that forsaken chapter ever since i got a feeling that euron wants to cause as much chaos as possible for his own pleasure
asoiaf,not_removed,on your first point perhaps the process of making himself tptwp in itself could be considered the birth
asoiaf,not_removed,if he claims daenerys hell ownhave the blood of aerys and rhaella
asoiaf,not_removed,but another and very vital part of the prophecy is that azor ahai must have the blood of aerys and rhaella targaryen according to a woods witch what makes you think euron would ever be in a position to hear anything at all from the woods witch op is saying that euron wants to be tptwp not that he is tptwp stannis didnt descend from aerys either yet melisandre still thought he was tptwp why because she also has never met the woods witch and even if she had why would she believe her
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think the blood thing is widely known though i mean not enough for euron to know the red priests around the world may or may not know it melisandre doesnt know about it because grrm said she has her own agenda and she never bothers to mention the blood in her pov or her gospels
asoiaf,not_removed,the dragons from stone line seems to heavily imply something regarding volcanos dragonstone is literally a volcano waking dragons from stone eruption obsidian
asoiaf,not_removed,nah it seems too easy to me
asoiaf,not_removed,or maybe it means literally magically hatching dragons out of stone if only there was a character that did just that hm
asoiaf,not_removed,the eggs are described as stonelike in weight and feel other than feeling slightly warm iirc
asoiaf,not_removed,they are stone eggs fossilised long ago they only feel warm to daenerys and only after she has had them for some time
asoiaf,not_removed,because the push isnt relevant to bloodravens plans everything that happens after is his awakening the loss of the use of his legs jojens arrival etc if bran is focused on who pushed him hes going to care be able to care about getting north of the wall
asoiaf,not_removed,i seem to remember bran says something along the lines of seeing bodies below him that have been impaled by falling i dont remember if it says out right that those people were greenseers who didnt learn to fly or if i just assumed thats who they were either way that was how i interrupted that scene if bran focuses on the trauma he wont learn to fly and he will die the tec doesnt want bran to die so he pushes him to forget and come to him beyond the wall instead bonus foil thats a bit off topic i have been wondering a lot lately if bran is the tec and brought himself to the wall i only say this because i re read brans chapters once he went to the cave and bloodraven never says that he was the tec just that he had been many things i always took this as br just not knowing how bran perceived him but im less sure now
asoiaf,not_removed,well he would probably realize whats happening tell someone the north would have an eye witness to confirm all the accusations about the lannisters and it would be much harder to get him beyond the wall if he would suddenly become so important for this petty war of the kings
asoiaf,not_removed,well the crow is the weirwood net so it is br but it is also the children and the dead souls as well its a collective conscientiousness there are no individuals i think he wants bran to fall so he will give up conscience control and just let his unconscience mind or subconscience take over basically so he drops down his defenses and lets br brain wash him
asoiaf,not_removed,because he wants him to learn to fly flying is just falling where you always miss the ground
asoiaf,not_removed,okay thank you
asoiaf,not_removed,if thats the case i hope for brans sake its worth it that tugs at my emotions that bran has essentially had to sacrifice his family for the greater good
asoiaf,not_removed,but surely if bran was able to tell ned or cat what happened that might have prevented cat from taking tyrion prisoner which was the catalyst for the war in the first place no
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree with all of this except the petty war part
asoiaf,not_removed,oh i like this idea lets see where it leads if i add a little tolkien so if the icy eye we keep seeing is the great other a symbolic reversal of the fiery eye of saruon with the eye of the crow being this same eye i think this suggests that br is a puppet of the great other in a similar way that theoden was with the great others dark influence possibly infecting the weirwoodnet and old gods so the great other might see bran as a new bloodraven to control using their warging and greenseer abilities to further his goals
asoiaf,not_removed,im hoping that when twow comes out we will start to see a lot more of whats actually happening with bran his adwd chapters are so crazy and it seems like bran may have been in that cave a lot longer than we are suppose to think he has it seems as though his weirwood throne is growing around him and at one point he mentions how a root is touching his cheek and i think his leg when he hadnt mentioned it before that point he doesnt know where meera and jojen are and he constantly refers to the different phases of the moon but at the same time says that the cave was black and no outside light comes into it idk its all so mysterious lol edit for clarity i know he sees the moon because he is skinchangingseeing through the trees but br tells us that time moves differently for a tree than a person and i could see bran just not realizing how much time he has been in the trees
asoiaf,not_removed,yes but still it would make bran an important person if not for war certainly for the conflict that already was there which would be a huge setback for bloodraven who needed bran not to focus on this and go north and he would not he would be i think better guarded as living proof for antilannister cause and would he preventchange war no disappearing almost all his love ones no burning of winterfell no escape no travelling north simply bran focusing on incest and falling deeper into the politics means bran not focusing on his magic path maybe refusing to go
asoiaf,not_removed,for bloodraven it is petty its about power struggle about lets say ugly chair and old good brothersisterfucking among few noble families and thats not for the first time in history meanwhile the important supernatural thread for all the world is coming whoever is he working for knowingly or unknowingly and none of them is paying attention although i would be happy if its just politics and no others i enjoy it
asoiaf,not_removed,that makes sense thank you
asoiaf,not_removed,born under a bleeding star
asoiaf,not_removed,hi this is really great but ive removed it because its fan art we allow fan art in comments but not as posts see httpswwwredditcomrasoiafaboutrules consider posting it to the weekly httpswwwredditcomrasoiafwikifanartfriday post and finally happy birthday
asoiaf,not_removed,got a bunch of tommy pattersons concept art framed for my birthday thought you folks might enjoy
asoiaf,not_removed,ah no worries had a wee feeling it may belong in fan art ill post it in the fan art thread and thanks d
asoiaf,not_removed,well he found out that he couldnt kill lf because of his ventinari defence the world without lf would be far worse than a world with him
asoiaf,not_removed,huge consequences if he killed lf and thats exactly why tyrion doesnt do it he says it to himself lf owns the majority of the gold cloaks and more importantly knows exactly where the crowns debts are with lf gone the seven kingdoms would enter an extreme age of poverty and who knows what would happen in kl if the gold cloaks rebelled and werent getting paid pycelle though no thats why when he got sent to the black cells nothing happened to tyrion no consequences whatsoever
asoiaf,not_removed,i love book varys more than show varys for this reason in particular you say varys is likable which is true enough in the show at least especially with him claiming to do everything he does because he actually cares for the realm but in the books varys only helps people so as to convince them that hes their friend and that they are completely reliant on him while in reality he has his own agenda and if anything uses his friendships with people as a means of learning even more secrets cersei once says that for the first couple years after she came to court she was convinced that varys was her closest friend whom she could depend on because he always appeared to help her and care for her and he does the exact same thing to tyrion and presumably to other important small counsel members hands and kings there would be basically no consequences to killing varys but hes convinced everyone that not only is he invaluable as a spy master but that hes their friend and that hes on their side and can be depended on as for littlefinger hes just damn good at his job at least on surface when people need money he provides it which is pretty nifty and more than once we here small counsel members like cersei and kevan wish they still had littlefinger to help them get money and while he might come off as annoying or slimey hes not really unpleasant so people appreciate his work and wouldnt want him dead ans while littlefinger isnt varys he still has spies and is a clever guy i think hed know if someone wanted him dead and would simply leave the city if he was in any significant danger yes he did own the gold cloaks to a degree but i doubt he would use them directly against the crown because in the end they do have much larger armies than him and its iffy whether or not theyd even follow him in outright treason when betraying ned they probably actually believed ned was the traitor or at least janos slynt convinced himself that ned was a traitor and thats what he fed his men grand maester pycelle is the least useful and the least powerful but theres also the least reason for wanting him dead he has always been a leal servant of the lannisters or at least everyone barring tyrion even if he was wanted dead that would be pretty distasteful since grand maester is a respected position and hes largely harmless to the lannisters
asoiaf,not_removed,the truth is tyrion should have told tywin about lfs hand in cat kidnapping him as soon as he made it to the lannister camp or at the very least he should have told tywin has soon as tyrion was appointed as hand there really is no reason not to
asoiaf,not_removed,well firstly itd just be stupid to off people on the small council thats way more suspicious than anything lf and varys are visibly up to optics matter in politics like that plus theres power to be had in being able to pressure others with power into divulging information you otherwise would not havein this case the scheming of varys and littlefinger that tyrion is privy too because the other parties believe it to be in their best interests to somewhat inform tyrion mind you both of them are still able to leave of what they do in the dark to him but thats more a matter of how long ago much of their plotting started rather than any incompetence on tyrions part it might not seem like a lot but if tyrion was able to go from of their plans to thats still more actionable intel for him to govern with than he would otherwise have and that is valuable beyond gold for political players like the three of them
asoiaf,not_removed,if hed just killed them tywin would want to know what the heck he was thinking if you kill talented people for no discernible reason no one will want to work for you ditto for sending them to the wall as for untrustworthy tyrion didnt know that about pycelle hed hoped he could trut the man going by his thoughts he did drop the ball on baelish from baelish framing him something he should have alerted tywin to and gone on to replace baelish with someone more definitely loyal to the lannister cause if he could but you could argue that getting rid of the guy whod delivered the iron throne to the lannisters without a clear reason would run back to my first point about the bad image it has incidentally varys was just as untrustworthy as those two even if hes likable which he might be to the reader but probably far less to the people in the story pycelle is a very well trained maester with knowledge of medicine and crude science and even if hes crap as a conspirator as we see in affc hes generally right about how the rosby situation the iron bank and the faith militant are all being horribly handled and so far two of the three have blown up in her face with the third probably about to baelish is a financial genius and has convinced everyone he gets them money even though when tyrion looks through his books he starts to realize its all scams and fraud but baelish did provide crucial manpower to secure the throne when ned decided to denounce joffrey and cersei a better move for tyrion would be to push pycelle into retirement once he found out the man was working for cersei instead of imprisoning him or even just leave him on the council until a suitable maester could be found on baelish hed need to investigate the mans books carefully while kings have gotten rid of inconvenient advisers all the time during a civil war you probably want to have something you can really pin baelish on so it doesnt look bad for you
asoiaf,not_removed,from the lannister point of view they absolutely had to have the tyrell alliance and littlefinger achieved it along with a plot to kill joffrey but if youre truly ruthless thats also a net plus for team lannister since joffrey was such an incompetent loose cannon and tommen so pliable however i dont think negotiating the alliance with the tyrells would have been all that hard for whatever diplomat they would have sent had they executed littlefinger another prolannister contribution of lf was the idea of renlys ghost jaime was the masquerade your notion or his loras lord littlefinger suggested it he said it would frighten stanniss ignorant menatarms so all told id say the sooner littlefinger were removed from the game the better off almost everyone would be except sansa but it was lf who told tywin about the wylis proposal so even sansa might have fared better at least in the shortterm
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion is soft thats why jaime and tywin would not hesitate to kill the man who convinced cat to kidnap them
asoiaf,not_removed,grand maester gerardys was fed to a dragon so it wouldnt be new for a grand maester to be executed no one likes the spider and lf is such a minor lord that who would possibly care that he was killed tyrions belief he cant touch lf is a plot contrivance if lf was absolutely important to the financial stability of kings landing then they would he be allowed to leave for the vale and be replaced by tyrion there would be complications if he had them killed but there would be no realmwide rebellion like when ned stark was killed i think the main issue is how he would do it lf and pycelle would be easy to assassinate or capture varys is another story im sure he has little birds waiting to jump out and defend him at any moment
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean he would need a legitimate reason or hed be hated even more
asoiaf,not_removed,how so
asoiaf,not_removed,getting rid of pycelle and janos slynt led to plenty of rumors about tyrion that helped push his reputation down even further he probably should have found a way to remove pycelle without the appearance of tyranny even if it ultimately was just focusing on getting rid of cerseis pawns
asoiaf,not_removed,i agree so very much i have always wondered why tyrion wasnt pissed that lf practically condemned him if my father was the most powerful man in westeros i would have all hell to pay for my imprisonment i would call a trial and have lf put to the screws
asoiaf,not_removed,agree tywin would want to know the details behind tyrions kidnapping and tyrion usually has a big mouth so shocking that lf remains in tywins good graces
asoiaf,not_removed,i think this was one of those instances that show how similar the personalities of tyrion and tywin the reason tyrion didnt run to daddy for help is that he wanted to take care of it himself
asoiaf,not_removed,not only gerardys maegor executed gawen desmond along with either hareth or another plus orwyle was imprisoned like pycelle would be
asoiaf,not_removed,littlefinger gave off the impression that he was a financial genius but he mostly embezzled and used loans to balance the books
asoiaf,not_removed,openly getting rid of pycelle might also make relations with the citadel touchy im sure pycelle isnt the only maester in the red keep so they wouldnt be too crippled but just imagine the reaction from oldtown when tyrion sends a raven please send us a new archmaester i had to behead the old one for disloyalty chances are the top guys are not going to be volunteering for that mission
asoiaf,not_removed,are we sure he embezzled
asoiaf,not_removed,oh lf was certainly cooking the books its why robert is so much in debt lf moves the money invests well but he doesnt pay it back creating an image of financial difficulties under a more austere ruler he would have been in serious trouble
asoiaf,not_removed,hes way ahead of everyone in westeros in terms of finance prior to littlefinger the crown apparently just sat on its earnings from tax and didnt even offer loans on interest or invest in anything which is strange because its not like no one else ever thought of that hes definitely more financially savvy than anyone else in westeros hes so far ahead of everyone else that no one really conceives of what hes doing not even tyrion until he actually looks at the books it certainly helped him out a lot that people would expect robert to bankrupt the crown of course
asoiaf,not_removed,the citadel likely doesnt send their best anyway the best stay back on the council to conspire
asoiaf,not_removed,if he decided he really needed to it would have been best to cast it as having pycelle step down as an honored man with a long career who just isnt the energetic man of action the king needs sure there might be anger anyway but at least it doesnt insult them so much the way he did it they nearly took the for them somewhat dangerous step of insisting only maesters can remove a grand maester toothless of course because they had no way to enforce it but really bad pr for tyrion and i imagine tywin didnt like having to insist on an order he personally didnt make and might not like
asoiaf,not_removed,as far as i know this is the evidence for it in affc jaime i six prisoners jaime thought sourly while we pay wages for twenty turnkeys six undergaolers a chief undergaoler a gaoler and a kings justice in practice only turnkeys and undergaolers actually work the chief gaoler was one of the antler men and had bought his office from littlefinger assuming lf is behind this mess then the antler man was the scapegoat and the wages for the phantom jailers were embezzlement then in asos tyrion vi we have he went back to work after she left trying to track some golden dragons through the labyrinth of littlefingers ledgers petyr baelish had not believed in letting gold sit about and grow dusty that was for certain but the more tyrion tried to make sense of his accounts the more his head hurt it was all very well to talk of breeding dragons instead of locking them up in the treasury but some of these ventures smelled worse than weekold fish i wouldnt have been so quick to let joffrey fling the antler men over the walls if id known how many of the bloody bastards had taken loans from the crown thought this could mean just about anything from tyrion not really understanding the subject that well lf making some bad investments or being overly generous with loans to people like the antler men to shady accounting and embezzling but even without going into specific text evidence given what we know of his character yeah he most likely stole here and there we just dont know the extent of it
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah if iirc there actually hasnt been a grand maester that was chosen from the conclave ie archmaesters it makes more sense if they only chose from the potentially hundreds of trained maesters that are at the citadel at least semipermanently better to have an excess than lack of after all additionally it would give them another duty in choosing a new archmaester if they picked one to be a new gm we know they arent keen on being chosen as seneschal though tbf that is a far greater professional restriction for those so tasked as
asoiaf,not_removed,maesters serve for life he cant step down
asoiaf,not_removed,well there was thirty turnkeys and gaolors to guard six men at the time but look how many men yoren took to the wall werent almost all of them in the dungeons always wondered about that
asoiaf,not_removed,holy shit i just realized that lf was probably who told on the antler men
asoiaf,not_removed,not from being a maester no bit from being grand maester is potentially different
asoiaf,not_removed,joffrey was able to force barristan out of the kingsguard on grounds of age and the grand maester serves as part of the governing structure of westeros you can make an argument that even if theyre always a maester they serve on the kings council at the pleasure of the king same as anyone else
asoiaf,not_removed,nah it was varys but these antler men are a little odd why were they given so many fishy loans why would a man who bought his office conspire to make stannis king were they maybe actually lfs men that varys wanted gone varys appeared not long after lord jacelyn had left men are such faithless creatures he said by way of greeting tyrion sighed whos the traitor today the eunuch handed him a scroll so much villainy it sings a sad song for our age did honor die with our fathers my father is not dead yet tyrion scanned the list i know some of these names these are rich men traders merchants craftsmen why should they conspire against us it seems they believe that lord stannis must win and wish to share his victory they call themselves the antler men after the crowned stag
asoiaf,not_removed,other way around the antler men had borrowed from lf so varys ratted them out to hurt baelish
asoiaf,not_removed,the antler men thing was definitely a way to dispose of people personally i think it was all varys he was getting rid of some of lfs people and destabilizing joffreys rule joffrey is a moron and would never think that varys was getting rid of his supporters its not like hes going to ask before he flings them into the river with a catapult
asoiaf,not_removed,probably cersei robert or tyrion robert is so notorious for drinking it is what kills him in the end tyrion appears to be a high functioning alcoholic but he seems tobe sobering up more now that he is with denaerys cersei just seems to be getting worse and worse as the days go by hopefully the intervention from the faith has helped her go cold turkey
asoiaf,not_removed,if you want a joke theory wyman manderly is azor ahai when the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers azor ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone the red star is the lionstar with its crimson sails the ship that carried the freys to white harbour the salt and smoke is from the kitchen where they were baked into pies or the feast where he feeds them to the wedding guests this is wymans rebirth going from coward to avenger when a freys cuts one of his chins the blood magic and flesh sacrifice takes effect he died for real the prince that is promised is said to have a song manderly requests songs from mance one of them foreshadows manderlys role as the ultimate saviour of the series who will end the long night it was true the lord of white harbor was the very picture of the jolly fat man laughing and smiling japing with the other lords and slapping them on the back calling out to the musicians for this tune or that tune give us the night that ended singer he bellowed thoros goes from obese to gaunt implying that he uses his fat to power berics resurrections burning it up similar to exercise i call this fat magic and wyman is brimming with potential along with illyrio and sam the wizard he is too fat to ride a horse but that doesnt mean he cant ride a dragon the stallion that will mount the world edit its also the lionstar and azor ahai tempers his sword in a lions heart azor ahai is the weather the name is a joke reference to azores high an anticyclone that influences the weather and climatic patterns of vast areas of north africa and southern europe it warms
asoiaf,not_removed,faegon targaryen if he is in fact who he claims to be he was born on the volcanic island that is dragonstone amidst smoke and salt a red comet was seen over kings landing on the night of his conception but more importantly his mother was a sun pierced by a spear a bleeding star
asoiaf,not_removed,moonboy for all i know
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime
asoiaf,not_removed,ser pounce i understand if this doesnt fit the specification of unlikely since its already been proven
asoiaf,not_removed,pod pod plunges his sword into the many women who love him but then there is a women that he loves more than all of them and when he pulls his sword out of her it burns with the fire of gonorrhea
asoiaf,not_removed,drogon totally crazy but if you keep the prophecy open to interpretation and consider the supernatural elements of ice the others and fire dragons it can work the prophecy indicates the following as the indicators of the coming of azor ahai born at the end of a long summer beneath a bleeding star amidst smoke and salt drogon was born at the end of a long summer beneath the red comet amidst smoke from the funeral pyre and the salt of the dothraki sea this piece is a stretch he shall wake dragons out of stone he is literally a dragon woken from what was thought to be a stone egg he shall draw from the fire a burning sword lightbringer this is a tough one but you can interpret a dragons flaming sword as its ability to breath fire furthermore if azor ahai and the prince that was promised are the same drogon fits even more as danys child he is born of the line of aerys ii and rhaella as prophecised by the woods witch and as the son of the queen is a prince maester aemon discusses that the prophecy was given in genderneutral language meaning it could be a prince or a princess in the same passage he discusses how dragons were also gender neutral and could change between male or female grrm uses misdirection and the misinterpretation of prophecies repeatedly throughout the story as major plot devices and drogon as azor ahai would fit that theme
asoiaf,not_removed,davos he was born in kings landing possibly a targ bastard or a descenent of one he was reborn at the battle of the blackwater salt is the sea smoke is fire light bringer being symbolic he loved shireen like she was his own daughter and she died by fire the bleeding star could simply be the burning ships of stannis fleet or maybe even the actual bleeding star he could eventually become entangled with danys dragons fulfilling that
asoiaf,not_removed,some people think jorah is aa
asoiaf,not_removed,aegon the one that had his head smashed up
asoiaf,not_removed,gillys son i havent put much time into the theory but hes definitely born amidst salt and smoke the watch always talks about the salted food hidden in the keep im pretty sure hes born during the red comet and i think he has some connection to ww because of crasters blood
asoiaf,not_removed,victarion
asoiaf,not_removed,rhaegar being azor ahai but being killed would be such a grrm move
asoiaf,not_removed,i think the prophecies that turn out to be right are the once that people tried to fulfill but then turned out totally different the woodswitch predicted that the heir or aerys and his sister would produce tptwp so rhaegar assumed it was his son aegon all he had to do was create one more dragonhead if rhaegar had not tried to fullfill his version of the prophecy jon would never have been born and neither would jon have been aa rhaegars prophecy that aegon is the prince that was promised aegon died and lyanna knew that she knew that he believed that rhaegar thought that aegon was tptwp her last act of love was naming their son aegon to make his prophecy right so the prophecy was right afterall but it was about another son an aegon the prophecy doesnt mean you have to kill lord voldemort forget for a moment about everything you know about the prophecy how would you feel about him harry he killed cedric he killed my parents i wanted him dead and i want to be the one who does it the prophecies comes true because people make it happen in a way they did not see comming
asoiaf,not_removed,you just opened the biggest can of worms op that prophecy can be applied everywhere cant not link the making the arguement for ser pounce as aa so if ser pounces father is a king then ser pounce is a prince and tommen makes a promise to cersei to let him have kittens making ser pounce a prince that was promised flawless logic
asoiaf,not_removed,cersei kills jamie choking him to death and becoming aa the prophecy was about jamie all along maggie the frog was thrown off by the fact that they were twins
asoiaf,not_removed,mance rayder because he is rhaegar and he jon and dany are the three heads
asoiaf,not_removed,jaime or brienne
asoiaf,not_removed,gendry since hes a blacksmith
asoiaf,not_removed,id like to think that it is arya because she can be whoever she wants now
asoiaf,not_removed,sam he will find something at the citadel and try to work a valyrian steel sword eventually he will create light bringer stabbing gilly through the heart
asoiaf,not_removed,my most out there tinfoil theory is that petyr baelish is azor ahai he is the man that put the realm into chaos as we know he says chaos is a ladder maybe he doesnt believe it is a ladder for only himself to climb but westeros as a whole maybe somehow he was given a prophecy that drove his amition to create the war of kings to get himself close to sansa he would kill sansa nyssa nyssa and become aa this could be why he sort of forces himself on sansa maybe he knew about everything all along and actually saw himself sitting the iron throne as a part of the prophecy of course this is all tinfoil would love to hear peoples thoughts on this
asoiaf,not_removed,brienne of tarth shes got lighbringer already either jaime or stoneheart is her nissa nissa theres also the whole thing about the lion of night and the maiden made of light
asoiaf,not_removed,the hound azor ahype
asoiaf,not_removed,itd be a cool redemption arc for edmure tully which is why itll never happen and hell just chill in casterly rock til hes like
asoiaf,not_removed,the hero must have a heros blade like none that had ever been plunged into water captured a lion he knew what he must do know that i love you best of all that is in this world he thrust the smoking sword through her living heart her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel whats the fastest route from slavers bay to westeros the smoking sea whats in the smoking sea smoke and salt of course what else is in the smoking sea brightroar a super badass valyrian swordlannisters that was plunged into the water why hasnt it been recovered most sailors fear the smoking sea and avoid it who are the bravest sailors in the world the ironborn where are they on their way to pick up dany and take her back to westeros would victarion want to prove that hes eurons equal by sailing the smoking sea you bet will dany be keen to take a shortcut to get there faster when she hears that a fake targaryen is stealing her birthright absolutely who did dany promise to give a super badass valyrian sword to as soon as she has one jorah who captured a lion jorah who loves a woman more deeply and passionately than anyone else in the series jorah whos going mad and may have to be killed by someone in her inner circle daenerys what character could be killed to give a sword maximum power against the others daenerys whats the worst thing grrm could do to jorah make him kill daenerys what is now branded into jorahs face a demon mask tying it together brightroar will be found and retrieved by danys fleet as she passes through on her way to westeros dany will grant the sword to jorah as promised jorah will use it to kill the lion he captured tyrion lannister at some point after that jorah will be forced to thrust the sword into the woman he loves more than anything in the world dany her blood soul strength and courage will go into the steel the blade will be dragonforged just as dany promised he will take the black as was his fathers dying wish he will be the lord commander he will drive back the darkness demon jorah is azor ahai reborn ser jorah mormont one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen
asoiaf,not_removed,nobody there is no aa prophesy is just a year game of telephone there is no such thing as the gods there is no one hero
asoiaf,not_removed,i always liked the theory that rhaegar was right the first time he was the prince that was promised he just also happened to be the prince that poorly communicated and got himself killed before he could save the world personally i dont think we will ever get an official confirmation on any of the prophecies i think the story will point heavily towards it being jon or dany but we wont ever get a confirmation
asoiaf,not_removed,one theory ive heard that i dont believe but find interesting is that rhaegar was really azor ahai but since he got himself killed the world is doomed
asoiaf,not_removed,well up until he died i thought beric had a shot currently along with jon and dany id go with gendry as being a candidate for azor ahai
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont think there will be an aa azhor ahai might be symbolic of virtous people who give up their worldly pursuits like power and wealth in order to fight against darker forces joining these dark forces might be easier than fighting them and people who are able to fight the force go on to be called azhor ahai when these people are able to overcome their materialistic pleasures then they bring the light that destroys the long night jon snow keeps emphasizing how the white walkers bring the long night with them i think the opposite will be true it is the arrival of the long night which awakens these creatures in order to stop the white walkers in my opinion someone has to stop the long night
asoiaf,not_removed,i get a laugh every time somebody tries to lay out the evidence for jon being aaptwp and how he fulfills the prophecy its literally the biggest stretches like how bowen marsh is crying so thats salt jons wound is steaming so thats smoke and ser patreks blue star sigil is bloody so thats a red star bleeding like lol
asoiaf,not_removed,well if you take the notion that the ptwp has to be from rhaella and aerys line theres really only three options fro azor ahai and two if you consider faegon isnt even in the show so honestly i cant think of anyone but jon or dany
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought we all knew it was gylbert farwynd
asoiaf,not_removed,jon dany and are collectively azor ahai because the dragon has three heads i dont commit to any one character as the potential third head yet but if aegon is real or at the very least a blackfyre he is a strong candidate
asoiaf,not_removed,on the other hand it is sort of unfair that brandon stark who is also brandon the builder and his partner in crime petyr baelish are not strong contenders those two are pretty much fillers for anything that cannot be solved or logically explained cannot explain the long night no problem brandon stark also brandon the builder cannot explain the long night no problem petyr baelish the man who loves chaos seriously i am surprised
asoiaf,not_removed,rhaego he actually lives and ser jorah just gave it to a dothraki to kill him and he she didnt dany never sees the corpse and mmd is the one who says that the child was monstrous and stillborn not even jorah was there when he was actually born
asoiaf,not_removed,ser pounce
asoiaf,not_removed,it took me aa second but good upvote fer ya edit i swear that was a typo but im leaving it
asoiaf,not_removed,excellent points but lets give due credit to greatjon umber the drunkest of the freys was tasked with drinking the greatjon into a sedated state it still took or so men to subdue him hes an alcoholic hes high functioning hes reckless and i love him
asoiaf,not_removed,tyrion is far from his bottom cersei would be a good candidate if only shed learned from her time in jail shes also not into that higher power stuff
asoiaf,not_removed,i would give you gold but all i have is one reddit stag take it ser its yours
asoiaf,not_removed,lulz that was my initial thought too
asoiaf,not_removed,i call this fat magic and a new power was born in westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,theory this is really neat to me out of all the aa tinfoil that has come from this subreddit and the other forums this is the first time ive seen mention of azor ahai as being directly related to another weather phenomenon httpsenwikipediaorgwikiazoreshigh it seems just punny enough for grrm to take and red herringify
asoiaf,not_removed,yknow during all my readings and watchings of this series it only just occurred to me what the stallion who will mount the world truly means i always pictured their prophecy as a great horselord who rides throughout the world conquering unopposed but no they literally picture a gigantic horse and its rider finding planetos vagine somewhere in the doom probably heard its warm and wet there or if its last call and he still hasnt found it a myrish swamp will just have to do and fucking the world into submission same thing i suppose but the fucking dothraki give me titters it is known
asoiaf,not_removed,born under a bleeding star sun pierced by a spear sunspear born amidst salty dornishman and smokeprobably the hot peppers they eat down there dragons born from stoney dornishman im not sure about this one but probably something to do with quentyn freeing the dragons from their stone cage gerris was a stony dornishman right or is arch the stony one not sure but either way ser archibald yronwood azor ahai confirmed hes always referred to as the big man right well wouldnt azor ahai be like the biggest man around in history duh i rest my case
asoiaf,not_removed,do we know he was born on dragonstone danaerys was but im not sure about aegon i thought rhaegar and elia were ensconced in kl at his birth
asoiaf,not_removed,whoah that last part never occured to me
asoiaf,not_removed,i missed the bit about the red comet being present during aerys reign i have a vague recollection of it driving his madness deeper but years for a comet to make its course back around to visibility seems short to me even given planetos odd seasons and astrology and i may be mixing some bits up in that vague recollection of mineill have to find and reread the extremely interesting essaystheory on why the seasons are the way they are planetos having once had two moons but the red comet smashing one throwing the planets balance and hence seasons out of whack causing the long night and birthing many different prophecies worldwide that are actually all the same including azor ahai written by someone with lucifer or morning star or both as his handle if i remember correctly it was an excellent read but it was over a year and a half maybe two since i read it edit it seems i didnt miss it i was just about to get to it when i picked affc back up i bookmarked when arya drank the kindly mans blinding warm milk and literally the next chapter is a samwell where he remembers aemon talking about rhaegar summerhall his sons and the comet i must find the astrological theory now and see where that fits
asoiaf,not_removed,if he does turn out to be fake and the dead aegon is tptwp that would be brilliant
asoiaf,not_removed,execution
asoiaf,not_removed,i would honestly love for it to be jaime something about having such a morally complex character as a savior figure would be much more impactful than having it be jon or dany who are much more likable but are also fairly generic fantasy hero material jaime who fucked his sister caused a civil war killed his king tried to murder a small child and helped psychologically torture his brother jaime who sacrificed his honor to save hundreds of thousands who loved his stunted little brother as no one else did who gave up his birthright for love who endangered himself repeatedly to protect his captor and who protested aerys abuse of rhaella when all of the most legendary knights in westeros turned a blind eye a peerless warrior who can no longer slay a pigeon a man as selfloathing as he is arrogant it would be a really nice change of pace for him to be the ultimate savior figure in westeros imo
asoiaf,not_removed,jamie i agree cersei will be his nissa nissa his love and a lion
asoiaf,not_removed,this is all i want
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe in the show in the books hes maybe by adwd and painfully shy to boot
asoiaf,not_removed,well drogon is also the stallion that will mount the world
asoiaf,not_removed,just what we needed a moody hormonal overtheatric teenage rebel drogon being told he is also the savior of the world i can imagine him showing off more than he usually does and thus driving his mom and brothers crazy
asoiaf,not_removed,i actually like this one
asoiaf,not_removed,totally out there and pretty valid too a real fan favourite that no one would have guessed i always thought he could make a great lord commander of the nights watch maybe he becomes and thats how he comes to face the white walkers
asoiaf,not_removed,you either die warging or live long enough to be a secret targ
asoiaf,not_removed,liam cunningham was told by grrm that something cool will happen to davos too
asoiaf,not_removed,people who like to root for friendzoned guys obviously
asoiaf,not_removed,thats my gut feeling too
asoiaf,not_removed,httphistoryalbertacaheadsmashedin
asoiaf,not_removed,the one left back at the wall or mances boy
asoiaf,not_removed,thats a core part to one of my favorite crack theories jonlightbringer it would also be an interesting twist storywise
asoiaf,not_removed,it would
asoiaf,not_removed,would be interesting how many times does the word promise appear in the books
asoiaf,not_removed,even though fraternal twins dont share the same dnai now have blood and bits of bone and grey stuff in my tinfoil hat and a raging headache to boot thanks for that
asoiaf,not_removed,i remember jaime being involved in that nordic theory and all but what about salt and smoke do jaime or brienne fit there
asoiaf,not_removed,after that last episode with arya wearing a serving girls face to serve walder his frey pie i think theres going to be some dark arya chapters you have a very pretty face did you know that arya touched the girl on the cheek ever so slightly i have a need for a very pretty face end chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,lets get dark all that while mances son is nursing at her left breast a little kings blood never hurt blood magic
asoiaf,not_removed,how about
asoiaf,not_removed,lol in the year ser dutchess lannister hahaha i completely forgot that trout we were supposed to send home before that crazy ass winter is still down there maester woodhouse ill fetch the rug sir
asoiaf,not_removed,this is not kafka fan page
asoiaf,not_removed,i didnt get it until you pointed it out so thanks lol
asoiaf,not_removed,bloody tough meat and horns of ale before a feast daily and a beard rivaled by few a man every other man to strive to be
asoiaf,not_removed,waht
asoiaf,not_removed,amazing south park reference cersei will probably lose her alcoholism when she witnesses some red god magic stuff
asoiaf,not_removed,leave it to grrm powered by chili verde
asoiaf,not_removed,well wouldnt azor ahai be like the biggest man around in history duh ser robert strong confirmed for aa
asoiaf,not_removed,him
asoiaf,not_removed,there are no men like me there is only me truer and truer with every word in the series
asoiaf,not_removed,yes this one is nice cersei can even be nissa nissa as another poster suggested but i dont like it for that i like it for the fact that the man who started the series as morally corrupt and thats putting it lightly and was destined to be remembered as the kingslayer for eternity is instead remembered by series end as a legendary hero his moral compass having did a as the story progressed which weve been witnessing unfortunately i think he falls more under the unlikely than valid character this thread is about and he will do some really good honorable things hopefully removing the kingslayer title and remembrance from history in the process for something more heroic but i dont see him being aa im in camp obvious that believes his and cerseis fates are chained with one killing the other or each other though its one of grrms biggest tropes not to be obvious so time will tell edit love your name by the way i think well be seeing that by the end too hah
asoiaf,not_removed,my pick for is the mannis himself
asoiaf,not_removed,hes still got a wife somewhere though
asoiaf,not_removed,probably how he dies
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its mostly show only people who think hes aa and yeah probably
asoiaf,not_removed,damn i forgot about mances boy could totally fit him too
asoiaf,not_removed,especially comparing book having eddard pov to the rest then doing it again when im and twow comes out and we get threeeyedbran then once more when i leave it in my will for someone to post back with adoss count id go check on my tablet but its early and im lazy
asoiaf,not_removed,brienne at least was born on an island
asoiaf,not_removed,ah yes but they say all kinds of things about the enormity of greatjon umber one has to wonder with grrms food obsession is there perhaps a conspiracy surrounding the spirits available to people tinfoil
asoiaf,not_removed,you cant help someone who isnt ready aa is about attraction rather than promotion
asoiaf,not_removed,a chick bleeding out her vagina is not a miracle
asoiaf,not_removed,does the fact that aa is also the same soul as jaime makes this statement less or more true
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah for me it would be him or jaime im of the controversial opinion that stannis downfall and death in the show was great but reading stannis taking the nights watch oath could be a seriesdefining moment if handled right
asoiaf,not_removed,i think ajorah ahai started before the show
asoiaf,not_removed,well there is that one film theory video
asoiaf,not_removed,haha on a serious note who knows in a series like this now i dont know if he had planned stuff out years in advance or if its a case of breaking bads make this and that event foreshadowed in addition to what we planned break out the old costumes buy some new ones in the same color paint the wall this color use that lense and that angle we used it seasons ago to great effecteither approach works though i think this series is a bit of both leaning more towards planned out either way its incredible what you see on a reread and its a series that has and will be studied meticulously word for word for a long long time in another thread i mentioned an incredible essay i read about the possible astrological history of the solar system planetos resides in the impact of the red comet and tying together prophecy and legend from all over the known world it was amazing and all from what at first seem to be simple books though i was hoping for slightly more from awoiaf than a history lesson on every targ i know theres some crazy things that can be tied in to the books hidden throughout its pages even in the targ middle chunk theres already been some really good material and theories posted based off it even from what my flair is based on dunk and egg while more fan servicey and fun adds to expand an already gigantic universe i like star wars pretty much as much as i love this series not for the basic material but the gigantic lore system it bred sorry for the rant on a joke post i just love the series and yes wish it was completed by now id be mad at hbo for giving a geek millions of dollars to play with and distracting him with a tv series but i love the show as well and yes im not an og who waited for each book after season aired i went out and bought a set of all the books i dont know i just love this universe and grrms take on the genre
asoiaf,not_removed,what about shadows
asoiaf,not_removed,stannis is da mannis i think something like this brilliant analysis happens however i think stannis lives and either selfimposes an exile or jon forces it on him after learning of shireen stannis swearing the oath as a punishment to himself would be amazing since it is not the ending he deserves but the one he needs
asoiaf,not_removed,i always felt one of the defining facets of stannis storyline was him not getting what he deserved from proudwing to storms end to the kingship he never gets what he deserves but he presses on anyways its admirable its also why i feel he shouldnt end up with a grander death its in keeping with that little tragedy of his character though in a way the wall is very inglorious so thats why i like him ending up there and that is a great analysis though its funny i agree so much on the foreshadowing and build up to why it has to be stannis burning shireen and it is so nice to see people noticing how much his story has been culminating in that for a change instead of using it to bash the show but i disagree completely with much of the show criticism for example stannis winning at the wall then losing to the boltons completely keeps with grrms theme of undercutting victories whats more i feel if stannis only has to burn shireen when hes literally faced with the others bearing down on him the difficulty of the sacrifice is lessened and the sacrifice lost a bit i think most people literally faced with the literal apocalypse could understand the sacrifice stannis made far more easily and would probably do the same but stannis is trying to plan ahead he needs to take winterfell to fight the walkers he needs to unite his kingdom to save it as much as his character has atheistic tendencies a lot of his arc relies on faith his faith in melisandre and the aa prophecy in particular by keeping shireens sacrifice more an act of faith theres a lot more thematic resonance and tragic nuance to it stannis knows the others are coming why is it okay to sacrifice her if hes faced with them but not when he still has time to prepare its a nice way to parallel the atrocities committed in the name of faith over the years are they wrong because theyre based only in faith would they be more morally acceptable if they were based in more fact if we know magic is real all readers do and mels magic is real most readers believe so and believe her red god to be real many readers do then is it okay to sacrifice a child to save thousands of soldiers to save the world is that not the just thing to do sorry i got carried away here i just love his whole arc and character like davos says hes a complicated man
asoiaf,not_removed,this is off topic and im going to remove it
asoiaf,not_removed,listen strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses not from some farcical aquatic ceremony
asoiaf,not_removed,arthur dayne and his magic sword dawn is a simple connection with king arthur and his magic sword excalibur but the comparison breaks down in the details he also didnt receive dawn via lake women hurling swords or by pulling it from stone i do think there are some parallels though for one excalibur was only retrievable by the worthy however some versions do mention that its by the rightful king likewise dawn is only bestowed onto the worthiest knights of house dayne when king arthur dies the sword is given to a safe keeper the maiden of the lake ned returns the sword to ashara who then fades into the water ashara drowns herself
asoiaf,not_removed,this is creepy i literally just had a conversation with an old friend from high school over the holidays and he detailed most of what you just said as well mainly the lotr bits and he didnt say anything about the danes of denmark he also went on to surmise that dawn was the original lightbringer and that nissa nissa was in fact of dayne blood sure dawn could have just been forged from a meteorite but it also could have been forged or tempered in the heart of a dayne heart of a fallen star the sigil of house dayne as we know from the tale of the forging of lightbringer the final step was to thrust the blade through nissa nissas heart if she were a dayne that is also the heart of a fallen star i actually created a post a few days ago trying to find any quote from george confirming that dawn was indeed just forged from a meteor and there wasnt anything now more than ever im convinced that the heart of a fallen star was in fact the heart of a dayne and that the tale of the forging of lightbringer is in fact the tale of the forging of dawn i mean dawn does bright light right also similar to the parallel of the edains following a fallen star to an island we also know from later editions of twoiaf that starfall is in fact an island logistically speaking if you were fighting an army of the undead that came from the north an island in the south seems like a good place to camp out could they have just been following a fallen star maybe but they also could have just been following someone of dayne blood imo it all lines up too well to be dismissed youve done it again joe great work
asoiaf,not_removed,also ser dayne is an anagram of daenerys which is pronounced similarly to dayne heiress tinfoil
asoiaf,not_removed,love it id never even thought of the bronnbrawn thing so imagine how much your main arthedain point blew my mind while researching the nazgul for another idea im working on colour me intrigued
asoiaf,not_removed,perhaps ashara or arthur is the bleeding star jon was born under
asoiaf,not_removed,this was a fantastic read ive long thought that both the daynes and valyrians were remnants of the great empire of the dawn geotd though i hadnt pieced so much together as you have here i am wondering what sort of interactions would there have been between the children of the forest and the geotd and in the dawn age in general is it possible that the history of the first men as we know them is entirely false and that all the ancient houses are remnants of some kind the inherent magical abilities of many first men houses eg blackwood and stark teases at this i have a feeling that the daynes likely have some aptitude with magic similar to the valyrians i would also guess that not all members of the geotd need have strictly valyrian features i am thinking specifically of the similarities between the eye colors of the ghosts in kings raiment that dany sees in the tent in agot and the titles of the emperors of the geotd interestingly the long night seems to have also struck the geotd which implies an overlapping timeline between it and the first men additionally the legendary history of the age of heroes does not match up at all with the official records of the first men for example the maesters report that the first men came with leather shields and bronze weapons and yet the daynes have dawn structures like winterfell were built and the starks clearly have an ancient tradition of placing iron swords on the laps of statues in the crypts and for what its worth old nan also reports that the others hated iron either way the official record doesnt seem to match up with surviving traditions structures or relics the geotd is reported to have collapsed following the long night so it would not be surprising that a technological regression could have occurred in its westerosi colonies giving rise to the leather shields and bronze weapons bit anyway that was a bit of a ramble good read certainly got me thinking
asoiaf,not_removed,this is brilliant if you think about it westeros was had several ancient families before the emergence of starks or even lannisters who themselves trace their origin to lann the clever on top of my list are barrow kings bronze kings fisher kings but it is the kings of torrentine and their sword dawn who are totally fascinating and mysterious they are one of the few families who keep showing up throughout the book in one way or the other jamie literally worshiped the land arthur walked on ashara keeps coming up throughout the series and there is the young ned dayne thanks again for sharing it definitely it is food for thought
asoiaf,not_removed,as far as arthur having no known origin i listened to a joseph campbell lecture where he suggested the art prefix was common across europe for nature gods eg artemis the authurian tales were originally nature stories refitted to stories about knights by celts to please the french lords who conquered england so at least according to campbell arthur was probably originally a nature god changed to a king to avoid offending christians with paganism
asoiaf,not_removed,i have always taken it in the sense of day as opposed to the long night as begins with a dawn
asoiaf,not_removed,damn dude im running outta tinfoil for hats with all your theories keep it up
asoiaf,not_removed,arthur dayne has always been my favourite minor character and i think its the mystery that makes him so appealing
asoiaf,not_removed,i wrote about parallels between arthur dayne and king arthur on this post
asoiaf,not_removed,the words dawn and lightbringer seem awfully similar dont they especially with errors that can be caused in translating between languages my best guess is that house dayne is a descendant of the real life azor ahai or one of the group he led in almost forgotten past
asoiaf,not_removed,via lake women hurling swords or by pulling it from stone because some watery tart threw a sword at him
asoiaf,not_removed,ok so serious question here every now and then there is a post making connections to outside work grrm based parts of his story on but in all these spiderweb connections has anyone really and truly guessed something important to the story based on these outside connections when i say something important im obviously talking about something important to the plot and overall story line not some insignificant world building
asoiaf,not_removed,maybe the dayne family came from the west
asoiaf,not_removed,house dayne as the heir of númenórean realms in exile an ancient realm quite interesting legend says the founder of house dayne elendil dayne followed a star to the place where he built his seat when he arrived he spoke the words out of the red mountains to dorne i am come in this place will i abide and my heirs unto the ending of the world no in all seriousness one could indeed see some similarities between house dayne and isildurs line of the house of andúniëthe just as osgiliath was built on the river anduin starfall was built on the torrentine which makes me wonder if starfall has a dome of stars both houses have a legendary sword as family heirloom and finally both houses lost their kingdom and fell into decay by the prolonged pressure of attacks from an outside force
asoiaf,not_removed,good catch with the sons of arnor connection the symbolism is there and everything
asoiaf,not_removed,but but buta man has no name
asoiaf,not_removed,at this point the daynes could turn out to be lizard people and i wouldnt be surprised
asoiaf,not_removed,the talk of earendil makes me wonder if the daynes had some previous relation with the star they followed and used to make their sword
asoiaf,not_removed,i really like the lotr link in this theory but i do take issue with you saying that he didnt take the sword from a stone his sword though given to him did come from a meteorite or is it meteor im not a falling rocks specialist and while you could certainly argue that all swords come from stone as the ore is mined from the ground daynes sword is certainly different all the metal came from a single fallen stone not from the earth or from a large vein this doesnt discredit your theory at all i just saw a conclusion that i disagreed with on the internet and felt that my opinion needed to be heard by the masses s
asoiaf,not_removed,arthur dayne is mance raydar
asoiaf,not_removed,oh great read he also didnt receive dawn via lake women hurling swords or by pulling it from stone how about an icy moon woman and being mined from a black stone would that count d
asoiaf,not_removed,absolutely love the arnorarthedain connection dont think jon will end up with dawn hes already got longclaw and going up against the others valyrian steel is going to be more important than a meteorite sword but looks like a solid tolkien allusion grrm really hid in there nice find
asoiaf,not_removed,whot if i went around proclaiming myself emperor because some moistened bink threw a scimitar at me theyd lock me away
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought this would come up soon now im imagining the dayne kings of the past going round oppressing peasants
asoiaf,not_removed,where have i heard this before
asoiaf,not_removed,ashara didnt drown she threw herself off a tower
asoiaf,not_removed,whats your friends name maybe we accidentally have a mutual acquaintance
asoiaf,not_removed,just for the record dawn is not always said to be made from a heart of fallen star which yes sounds like a phrase ripe for double meanings in twoiaf it speaks of a pale stone of magical powers which was made into dawn so we are at least meant to believe that in universe this story is about a meteorite and thats what people take it to mean also there is separately a ton of evidence for meteor impacts as i have detailed on my wwwlucifermeanslightbringercom i would suggest that that two meanings are far from exclusive why not make a meteor sword and consecrate it with blood magic essentially i believe there is good reason to believe in meteor swords and theres also very good reason to believe in making swords with blood magic the correlation between the heart of a falling star language and the idea of lightbringer being tempered in nissa nissas heart is surely not coincidence i agree on that we also have a black meteor story involving the bloodstone emperor out east at the end of the great empire of the dawn and thanks ujoemagician for mentioning the great empire of the dawn theory joe magic i really love the lotr links which reinforce the daynes as a last descendent of a long vanished great civilization would have nice to include those in our great empire of the dawn episode but i have never heard anyone make that comparison before even though its quite obvious in retrospect the dayneheiress thing is tempting especially since danys ancestors held those swords of pale fire which could certainly be what dawn would look like if it ever caught fire i prefer the theory that dawn is the original ice of house stark but the pale fire connection to the great empire of the dawn is also quite compelling i have speculated that perhaps dawn has a more important purpose then simply as a cleaver – perhaps its the worlds most powerful glass candle or something if there is some sort of magical noncombatant use for dawn then i would favor daenerys as being the one to use it
asoiaf,not_removed,daenerys dayne heiress ned stark neds arc jon snow jon knows howland reed howl and read
asoiaf,not_removed,and dont forget the fallen star yvaine in the movie stardust was played by claire danes but wait theres more yvaine clare danes is an anagram for a craven dayne lies which means arthur dayne of starfall actually ran away a craven from the tower of joy instead of fighting so the theory the the halfhand was in fact arthur dayne sure seems fng confirmed i like how this tinfoil hat fits so snugly this is fun
asoiaf,not_removed,nah someone would have commented if she looked like a dayne
asoiaf,not_removed,thats exactly what i do with names in asoiaf haha i focused a lot on jon but everything about the edains applies to her as well im not enough of a lotr enthusiast to know if theres a similar character as her or her family but i wouldnt be surprised
asoiaf,not_removed,and confirmed
asoiaf,not_removed,holy shit thats canon
asoiaf,not_removed,i knew this was gonna happen was hoping a far greater lotr nerd was going to show up and add more relevant information its a law of the internet thatd be an interesting connection if the mormonts were connected to them somehow or if the original sigil of the daynes was a bear or perhaps if they used to have animal familiars like the valyrians and starks
asoiaf,not_removed,if arth is realm could it rather be a corruption of hearth as in home the place you lay your hat
asoiaf,not_removed,im using the nazgul to try and understand the others who they are how they view themselves what their motivations are i think george used them as a starting point to create his own unique bad guys
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,ive read that when the bloodstone emperor took the throne from his sister which is how the long night happened he married a tiger woman a tiger woman can also be a different way of describing a cotf they have cat like eyes and claws and that surely looks like a tiger to me edit the ifequevron or wood walkers are a mythical race said to have inhabited the dense forests of northern essos it is unknown if there is a connection between the children of the forest and the ifequevron or woods walkers of northern essos vaes leisi is a ruined settlement of carved trees and haunted grottoes in the kingdom of the ifequevron there you go puts them in perfect position to the geotd
asoiaf,not_removed,well we know something was pushing the first men when they came to westeros what if they were running from the empire which was gobbling up the known world the first men get here the empire eventually catches up and is in the process of establishing a foothold the long night hits oh maybe the landing of yet another invader before the andals triggered the cotf overreaction and the empire collapses
asoiaf,not_removed,food for thought is exactly what i thought while eating my breakfast
asoiaf,not_removed,who got mixed in with what is likely an actual historical event where a welsh war leader possibly of romeobritish descent stopped the first wave of saxon incursions
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,then you must loove darkstar he is of the night
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah a ton of stuff httpslucifermeanslightbringerwordpresscom if you are curious
asoiaf,not_removed,house dayne is mentioned quite often in the asoif books arthur and ashara dayne keep popping up for two characters who belonged to a minor house grrm has also stated dawn is currently at starfall and it has not bedn weilded as yet
asoiaf,not_removed,i really want a pov inside starfall dont think well get it though unless areo hotah ends up not stabbed to death exactly right on the lotr references some i didnt even catch and wish i had included theyre so obvious its difficult to ignore and i believe confirms large parts of the great empire of the dawn theories for me and makes me lean much more towards there being a historical lightbringer that is in all probability dawn
asoiaf,not_removed,lotr wiki dives sometimes turn out wonderful
asoiaf,not_removed,somebody get uluciferlightbringer on the phone
asoiaf,not_removed,help help im being oppressed
asoiaf,not_removed,
asoiaf,not_removed,monty python
asoiaf,not_removed,into the sea so either she died on impact with the water or drowned or some tinfoily alternative shes sinkin either way
asoiaf,not_removed,hey lml im looking through my copy of twoiaf and i cant seems to find the pale stone of magical a powers being made into dawn can you point me in the right direction
asoiaf,not_removed,lml i really need to get back on your podcast train im curious on your thoughts on this question do you think lightbringer would be a unique weapon in history from danys visions we see who appears to be the gemstone emperors with flaming swords do you think they all holding the same sword the blackfyre of their dynasty a unique royal blade or perhaps these weapons used to be as common as valyrian steel in their day the existence of dawnmaybe lightbringer being the last of its kind like the daynes themselves and hey you can always do more on the geotd or just a lotr reference episode
asoiaf,not_removed,so thats why we havent seen howland hes a bibliophilic werewolf
asoiaf,not_removed,how much does jon snow know again
asoiaf,not_removed,arya stark are you ye a stark
asoiaf,not_removed,thats what i do i howl and i read things
asoiaf,not_removed,barry stan has actually said that she reminds him of ashara or was this sarcasm
asoiaf,not_removed,i currently think that there is more similarities between the dead men of dundarrow and the others both are armies of the dead i had wondered if like the dead men of dundarrow there would be a certain oath they had to keepbreak
asoiaf,not_removed,what were you breaking your fast with brown oatbread with stewed plums and some sweet dornish wine mayhap
asoiaf,not_removed,just minor point here dawn has been wielded however it is not currently being wielded it waits at starfall for the next sword of the morning it has not been wielded since ser arthur daynes death and ned starks returning of it i personally believe ashara dayne was in the tower of joy and i believe the show proved my theory with the woman they showedbutdidntshowmuchof and that ned didnt just return dawn to starfall he escorted ashara back to starfall and from there the rabbit hole gets deeper but anyway i digress anyway yeah its waiting for the next sword of the morning maybe young edric becomes jon snowaka aegon stargaryens sotmkingsguard oh yeah baby
asoiaf,not_removed,i replied further up ujoemagician nice work here
asoiaf,not_removed,sort of it has more to do with the fact that i think the star the daynes followed fell at battle isle and they mined the black stone for the icy core
asoiaf,not_removed,dont you see the violence inherent in the system
asoiaf,not_removed,ill show you oppression mod powers activate
asoiaf,not_removed,ive always gotten an vibe from ashara
asoiaf,not_removed,legend says the first dayne was led to the site when he followed the track of a falling star and there found a stone of magical powers in the dorne kingdoms of the first men but to to be fair its just legend and doesnt call the stone pale its just the fallen star legend again
asoiaf,not_removed,you might have missed it because it is not in the sotm section but rather the overall dorne section talking about fm migration at the mouth of the torrentine house dayne raised its castle on and island where that roaring tumultuous river broadens to meet the sea legend says the first dayne was led to the site when he followed the track of a falling star and there found a stone of magical powers his descendants ruled over the western mountains for centuries thereafter as kings of the torrentine and lords of starfall also the tower at starfall is called the palestone sword so it seems an actual rock is part of the legend one wonders if they might not even have some of the original meteorite there is some sort of weird shrine or something
asoiaf,not_removed,hey joe yeah if you fell off the podcast train youre missing out at least people are telling me my last couple have been really good but hey you know where to find them its only a matter of time before you have a long commute or arduous chore to do and you remember you have a few hours of mythical astronomy in the bank ready and willing bathe that podcast and bring her to me i tend to agree with your second idea that dawn would be the last of a type of sword which used to exist is slightly higher quality of course i dont think dawn is lightbringer at least not the lightbringer my theory is that lb was made from the bloodstone emperors black meteor that it was a kind of predecessor of valyrian steel and that it is basically an evil sword azor ahai being the dude who broke the moon and caused the ln after all i think aa made his black blade in a perversion of geotd tech if you will heres the thing all of that is only if dawn happens to be a sword from the great empire there is also quite a bit of evidence to suggest it is the original ice of house stark who knows perhaps those two things are not mutually exclusive but there is some sort of mystery here i cant decide if dawn comes from the frozen north or the far east because remember pale flame doesnt necessarily mean a pale sword we saw the black valyrian steel on eurons dragon binder horn turn white hot as it heated up black obsidian candles cast light which makes shadows darker but also colors brighter this is why i am always so leery of color symbolism – its so subjective and malleable however the evidence for a black meteor sword is abundant so thats the one thing i am most convince stuff – azor ahai had a black meteor sword and that is the lightbringer of legend was that the same sword which ended a long night maybe maybe not there are also a lot of clues about sword breaking and sword splitting even reforging of swords laying around here and there so it could be that the sword we know as lightbringer went through some kind of transformation i dont mean to talk in circles but i hesitate to try to get to specific if i dont see very clear evidence instead i prefer to entertain the most plausible possibilities – and i think the two obvious possibilities for the sword dawn is that it either comes from the far east from danys ancestors or it is the original ice of house stark or somehow both
asoiaf,not_removed,no if he reads howl then howland reed is actually alan ginsburg the famed beat poet bard of west coast westeros
asoiaf,not_removed,nada
asoiaf,not_removed,now he knows whats after death so nothing
asoiaf,not_removed,because of her eye color though switch the rarity of brown with purple and suddenly everyone with brown eyes looks the same especially when youre really old and guilt ridden
asoiaf,not_removed,interesting i hadnt heard of those before theres so much history in lotr i bet you could find endless connections like these the reynes of castamere is a really good one too this happens often in our community parallel thought and idea generation the post i tied for best post of the year with on waymar royce turns out while iwas writing it a now fellow mod had come up with a similar idea deep in a comment tree i hadnt seen
asoiaf,not_removed,i cant help but influenced by the show with seeing the nazghul as a more fitting comparison fallen kings and men seduced by magic they dont understand cursed to a halflife i like the idea that the others got where they are by greed and fear like the kings of middle earth did but i can definitely see the dundarrow comparison
asoiaf,not_removed,yes my friend would you be kind enough to join me
asoiaf,not_removed,for me it was dry flaky bar of granola bits dripped in caramelized sugar washed down with a metallic tankard of cooled caffeinated water soaked in beans infused with extract from the quarthean vanilla plant
asoiaf,not_removed,thanks i forgot to add currently i have my fingers crossed too about the dayne arc i think they are important come on grrm what are you doing sir
asoiaf,not_removed,could you elaborate on your theory
asoiaf,not_removed,starfall was built where they found the meteorite while battle island is at oldtown doesnt quite line up
asoiaf,not_removed,knowledge power is power
asoiaf,not_removed,love that one thats the poe one ya
asoiaf,not_removed,i saw the best wargs of my generation destroyed by a mad king craven hysterical naked
asoiaf,not_removed,oh shit
asoiaf,not_removed,not very nice
asoiaf,not_removed,supposedly but i think thats wrong the closest evidence to their location that anything fell from the sky is the blackstone at battle isle which seems to have rough tunnels mined through it which suggests they were looking for something in the stone i believe its the substance used to forge dawn and the reason the others initially invaded they wanted the icy version of a valyrian steel sword the pale core from a black stone something they could actually use to fight against the obsidian and dragonsteel that was potentially decimating them
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah
asoiaf,not_removed,nice allusion but dont do poe im doing poe
asoiaf,not_removed,i also believe that the story is rather metaphorical and understand its essence as followed the story of azhor azhai lightbringer is about how to battle evil with the help of magic supernatural powers to ultimately defeat the enemy maybe the others you need to gain control of a mystical force maybe a magical sword but probably not the way to gain this force requires a dreadful sacrifice of some sort
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah looking at our own ancient history and of old oral myths we say there probably wasnt an achilles but a war between troy and greece certainly happened who knows why but it probably wasnt over some woman named helen but in a fantasy universe we apply different logic magic is real maybe a more stern man like ned stark who doesnt believe in magic or old nans tales might say lightbringer probably wasnt real but someone like bran knows better so although i agree with you that the story is vague and probably inaccurate i think it is definitely likely foreshadowing someone plunging a sword through the chest of someone they love and releasing some sort of magic from it edit sorry if i wasnt clear i mostly agree with you and good work and good quote pulls i like it
asoiaf,not_removed,prophecy is like a halftrained mule it looks as though it might be useful but the moment you trust in it it kicks you in the head tyrion
asoiaf,not_removed,i have to add that magic lighthouse the hightower to the list of lightbringer possibilities yes the myth is unreliable but its there for a reason and represents both an event in the past and foreshadowing a future event
asoiaf,not_removed,the sword in the darkness the light that brings the dawn please add the nights watch to the op after all their vow has many ambiguous words within the bullet point is that the one who guides the nw jon snow could swing it as a sword metaphorically so why is the jade compendium unreliable its an ancient tome right well it was written by a volantene this is a very sweet catch
asoiaf,not_removed,i thought it was a story sort of about the forging of valyrian steel and that would also include a theory that valyrian steel required blood sacrifice in its tempering perhaps even through a dragons heart idk getting very tinfoily but this has all been interesting
asoiaf,not_removed,i think its a metaphorical story about how to make a magic flaming sword it probably will not give anyone reading it an actual understanding of how to make a magic sword but if you knew how to make one and you read the story of light bringer you would probably understand how the two were connected for example if human blood is a requirement then it would stand to reason that water and the lion failed as a quenching material though it probably does not need to be the love of your life either
asoiaf,not_removed,ive seen lightbringer proposed as longclaw reforged ice dawn the stone dragon from danys undying visions jon snow a metaphor for obsidian the recipe for valyrian steel stannis glowstick is the real deal you forgot a metaphor for the wall or the nights watch i am the sword in the darkness which is pretty damn popular and it was even here before the season when we had a change in demographics
asoiaf,not_removed,like most of the stories of the modern bible the myth of lightbringer and indeed most prophecies or histories from before aegons conquest should be viewed as parabolic and not taken as literal truths
asoiaf,not_removed,also lots of people forget or ignore that we have already seen a flaming sword beric had an authentical magic sword which was on fire im not saying this was lightbringer but it shows us that the myth is probably real and that one of our heroes or more than one is going to have a flaming sword probably the conditions to have one are not clear but if jon is revived it would not be weird if he could turn longclaw in a flaming sword this would not be lightbringer it would only be a sword on fire but maybe this is what lightbringer was and the prophecy comes from fire magic that often needs a blood sacrifice edit i think was able to be revived because he was on a war later cat could be revived because beric gave his life i think someone is going to give his life to revive jon
asoiaf,not_removed,personally i think its just a fanciful retelling of others being killed with obsidian there might be some extra magical component as well when he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast its blood began to boil smoke and steam poured from its mouth its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks and its body burst into flame is like someone exaggerating what sam did to the other mixed in with the proper way to dispose of wights
asoiaf,not_removed,i think this is it i think there is some kind of fire magic that gives power to the user and this magic needs a blood sacrifice we have seen at least two examples of this magic cat and beric i think the magic not only keeps them alive but gives them power beric was able to summon a flaming sword in both cases lifes were taken to revive the new user beric was revived during a war and then gave his life to revive cat
asoiaf,not_removed,well we know for a fact that blood magic is a thing so the story itself can be taken as a clue to that just on its face maybe love is necessary maybe its completely irrelevant
asoiaf,not_removed,gorghan of old ghis once wrote that a prophecy is like a treacherous woman she takes your member in her mouth and you moan with the pleasure of it and think how sweet how fine how good this is and then her teeth snap shut and your moans turn to screams that is the nature of prophecy said gorghan marwyn
asoiaf,not_removed,there are a million and one proposed lightbringers im not saying its untrue just the details are unreliable was it really a flaming sword did he really have to plunge the sword through a living human
asoiaf,not_removed,my guess is that its forged with spells and dragons fire or volcanic fire since they are somewhat similar and tempered with a human sacrifice in qohor they were supposedly using slave children trying to re create valyrian steel but i dont think it works the same the human sacrifice must be someone who is loved and wanted otherwise its not a true sacrifice so the heat of the dragonflame and the essence of that person all go into that blade thats why they cost so much it also fits with fire and blood being the basis for most of the sorcery they used to go on i think its that same darker sorcery that they learned from the leftover people from asshai and the great empire of the dawn after the long night they were into sorcery there too and had dragons as well we see what asshai looks like now my guess is due to some type of magic cataclysm similar to valyria these valyrians were people left over from the great empire of the dawn maybe those who didnt practice magic unlike the people of asshai sometime after the long night those shepards got lucky and found the eggs they sought knowledge from those people from asshai that survived and they taught them the darker sorcery blood magic how to bond with dragons and possibly how to make dragon steel valyrian steel its stated that there were dragonsteel blades used in the long night and the long night happened long before valyria so im a believer that this is a botched tale of someone figuring out how to make dragonsteel valyrian steel now this word lightbringer may or may not be referring to dragonsteel the word lightbringer may have been mashed into that story after thousands of years of retelling other stories and mixing them up but i think the dragon steel is a big part of the fight against the others and how they were defeated maybe they found that they were affected by only the hottest fires like magical volcanic fires then learned obsidian harnessed the same magical essence of these super hot fires but they realized they still needed something more as obsidian blades and arrows were not enough after conferring with people of magical knowledge they came up with the idea to harness that fire into steel sonce it would be harder than obsidian then this guy tried and tried and finally got it right along with all the other tactics the dragon steel was the finishing tough they needed to be able to drive back the others
asoiaf,not_removed,jon wouldnt even need to be revived to have a flaming sword as thoros also is later seen to have a flaming sword alongside beric thoros and lord beric were everywhere their swords swirling fire given that thoros is far from his wildfire stores in kings landing and therefore his sword legitimately is on fire either beric lit thoros sword for him or thoros can light his own sword which seems much more likely as beric had to have learned how to light his own sword from somewhere in the first place and it seems much more likely that he learned it from thoros when thoros decided to try out all the old spells and rituals after he inexplicably resurrected beric than that beric just lit his blood on fire by accident
asoiaf,not_removed,youre projecting
asoiaf,not_removed,if youre interested in the fact that this stuff is meant to be unreliable or mythological mythical astronomy of ice and fire is a pretty good series of essayspodcasts that looks into that the guy who does it has some reaches in terms of how he interprets text occasionally but the early podcasts really go into a lot of details about the whole azor ahai and lightbringer myth edit httpslucifermeanslightbringercom the blog the bloodstone compendium is where this starts
asoiaf,not_removed,oh i totally agree just felt the need to shill for my favorite lightbringer tinfoil
asoiaf,not_removed,im obviously a fan of the more metaphorical ones ill have to search this one out
asoiaf,not_removed,it revolves around a passages that talks about hightower cutting through the city like a sword and the really weird stuff about battle isle and the black oily stone maze plus the fact that some people think that the hightowers may have arrived in westeros before the first men
asoiaf,not_removed,i believe george asks people not to record but someone who actually attended the event can confirm
asoiaf,not_removed,can comfirm that at balticon he did not want it recorded a bunch of us took very copious notes though
asoiaf,not_removed,theres doubt hes coming back
asoiaf,not_removed,theres an interesting theory that dany actually died and was resurrected when her dragons were born it ties in with another theory that xaro tries to poison her and nothing happens to her
asoiaf,not_removed,some claim that quentyn martell died in his point of view chapter but these are sweet summer children who dont know that the chapter cuts out way before anyone dies and that burnt bones prove nothing
asoiaf,not_removed,ive been saying this forever jon will come back but we wont get his pov and if we do it wont be jon it will be the white wolf or something because jon will at least be having an internal conflict
asoiaf,not_removed,i dont like the idea of not getting any jon povs
asoiaf,not_removed,ye
asoiaf,not_removed,i think quentyn would like to have a small word with you oh as would maester cressen and pate and merrett frey and kevan catelyn technically died though she was resurrected you could even argue lady stoneheart isnt even catelyn anymore just the shell of her
asoiaf,not_removed,the chances of no more john snow pov chapters are slim to none
asoiaf,not_removed,i honestly dont believe hes coming back as a human my theory is that hes stuck around in ghosts body for the rest of the book and then he goes on searching for bran whos calling out for him or something
asoiaf,not_removed,jon wont be brought back immediately like in the show i think hell be dead for a good portion of twow
asoiaf,not_removed,now that is clever well done for spotting it
asoiaf,not_removed,honestly if we dont have jon povs anymore shocked and appalled is what i will be
asoiaf,not_removed,how do you know tatters wasnt there everyones in brazen beast masks based on the obvious nature of the tp saying that nobody would know who he is without the tatters grrm has set off a huge chekovs gun that quentyn will fulfill by taking his tatters i get that his clothes caught on fire thats hardly a death sentence you can put out fires sure quentyn isnt the type of character that would be a mercenary leader but thats why characters change during a story characters grow and become different people quentyn probably realized that his friends have been playing him and is now ready to take control for himself he learned a lesson and is not the character he was back at yronwood
asoiaf,not_removed,if jon doesnt get a pov who will have one in the north and how will we see jons resurrection theon seems to be stuck with stannis close to winterfell for now bran is probably going to stay north of the wall for a while davos is on skagos and if he succeeds in finding rickon hell probably head for the last hearth or white harbor not the wall so through whose eyes are we going to watch jon sansa and arya might eventually head to the north but not soon enough for a resurrection melisandre is an option but i cant imagine only seeing jon through her eyes for the majority of twow
asoiaf,not_removed,i get that barristan thinks hes dead but barristan is just looking at burned bones they could be any bodys bones dany sets this up by saying burnt bones mean nothing i understand that the oil on quentyns whip caught fire and that traveled to his body sure he could be badly burned but to suggest that hes dead is too presumptuous most people who get burned dont die you cant just say that quentyns dead because he was on fire and someone presented some burnt bones you need some proof to match quentyn up with those bones
asoiaf,not_removed,hello first time posteram i allowed to post something season related spoiler as an answer here
asoiaf,not_removed,this isnt true people die from their pov in most of the prologues and epilogues i also dont honor that cat doesnt count we all know jon is coming back but i dont really consider this more evidence moreover i expect other characters to die in their own pov chapters in the future theon dany tyrion cersei
asoiaf,not_removed,how do you get dead after noticing that you are burning if anything noticing you are burning is a good thing if he was hit by dragon fire he would explode and his eyes would pop out as you read the oil on his whip caught fire and a little bit went up his clothes big deal he probably just did the old stop drop and roll and was fine he can learn a lesson whether he is dead or alive the adventure stinks plot still works whether he is alive or dead in fact a burned quentyn can communicate quite a powerful message
asoiaf,not_removed,brienne died in her pov chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,i dunno prolly not i mostly wanted to point out a pattern in grrms writing
asoiaf,not_removed,well there is the little matter of sixskins transferring his consciousness to oneeye given that i just assumed that jon would permanently upload into ghost
asoiaf,not_removed,some people do others doubt hes actually going to die
asoiaf,not_removed,the post would probably make better sense rpureasoiaf
asoiaf,not_removed,there was a really nice post pointing out a few subtle lines from sams pov where jon had been working on chain mail and that him wearing this during the attack will be what saves him but i guess now that the show has all but confirmed he actually dies its kind of irrelevant
asoiaf,not_removed,or that she died in the tent giving birth which we never really see in its entirety frankly id be shocked if she didnt go through at least one more experience where she totally should have died but didnt
asoiaf,not_removed,sounds interesting could you post a link to that theory
asoiaf,not_removed,that theory shouldnt be seen with naked eyes some tinfoil protection is required
asoiaf,not_removed,true he also died days after that chapter if he did die at all
asoiaf,not_removed,oh sweet summer child quentyn died in barristans pov chapter
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean speaking of sweet summer children golly i hope quentyn is alove
asoiaf,not_removed,thats it well get a pov from ghosts perspective with jons consciousness melded in sitting at the foot of his corpse while melisandre does her thing
asoiaf,not_removed,quentyn died three days after the bbq and the others are prologue and epilogue characters not regular pov characters
asoiaf,not_removed,all prologue and epilogue characters die its what they do
asoiaf,not_removed,quentyns death is still very debatable burnt bones prove nothing and the rest are prologue or epilogue characters which is a totally different thing
asoiaf,not_removed,i mean it cant be that long—wouldnt want john getting all gross and decomposed like stoneheart
asoiaf,not_removed,not unless you spoiler tag it
asoiaf,not_removed,and came back in adwd characters who presumably die in their own chapters arent gone
asoiaf,not_removed,i guess this could be similar to that weird switch to third person narration while victarion has his infected arm cured by moqorrow the pov pulls back from dany once she goes in the tent right
asoiaf,not_removed,and
asoiaf,not_removed,last time i saw him he was on fire so he probably went to the store to get ointment yeah thats why he hasnt had a chapter in a while
asoiaf,not_removed,lmfao bbq
asoiaf,not_removed,chett didnt die in his prologue though he was killed soon after
asoiaf,not_removed,this theory makes sense from the perspective of temperatures of dragonfire and the melting point of whip handles it does not make sense from the perspective of what grrm was doing with the character arc and pretty much all the themes in quentyns story is viserys still alive because the gold melted too quickly and thus must have been simply lukewarm fakegold even that burned bones prove nothing line always cited comes from dany actively deluding herself in the hopes that drogon didnt kill that meereenese child
asoiaf,not_removed,burnt bones prove nothing i keep seeing this is that a meme
asoiaf,not_removed,i have never read anywhere that suggests quentyn is still alive or that its even debatable i guess you can say prologueepilogue characters are different i was just responding with those because op said pov characters and those are still all pov characters
asoiaf,not_removed,only alex jones can claim quent is alive
asoiaf,not_removed,ice cells
asoiaf,not_removed,hm ok thx doesnt seem possible on mobile
asoiaf,not_removed,shit still in the process of reading adwd havent gotten there yet ill now be prepared
asoiaf,not_removed,reading through danys resurrection here are some things i noticed contradictions from the show not included in the theory how dany walks into a fire unscathed though targs arent immune to fire shes immune because she is fire made flesh okay so this implies that fire cant harm her but we know that to be false in adwd because she has burns from taming drogon grrm has also said the fire immunity was a one time thing so what happened did she somehow get brought back to life in the ritual or did she just do the ritual properly and not die from it how dany survived the house of the undying cough which was not made for mortal men i am no man okay just kidding warlocks are mortal arent they i might be wrong on that one
asoiaf,not_removed,you dont die from being on fire you just roll around and the fire is extinguished its hardly a fatal condition i dont dispute that quentyn could be burned but theres no reason to say that hes dead
asoiaf,not_removed,a burn heal not ointment
asoiaf,not_removed,but we had bran and rickon burnt only to come back and stannis burnt mance and he came back there is still a good story for quentyn if he lives to confront doran over his crazy plan
asoiaf,not_removed,in order for qm to be alive we would have to be out of the loop of a lot that went on off screen however it is curious how he survived dragon fire for days i believe every other person or animal hit by dragon flame was killed very quickly with them exploding in flame or melting
asoiaf,not_removed,iirc its what dany thinks when the man comes to court and claimes that her dragon killed his daughter
asoiaf,not_removed,ice food storeroom to be reborn amidst smoke and salt mmmm hams
asoiaf,not_removed,to make spoiler tags type this s like this to get this s like this
asoiaf,not_removed,its definitely not easy
asoiaf,not_removed,spoilers adwd
asoiaf,not_removed,yeah i can see dnd using that tick again bc its porn which they did story porn it just means that well its regualr fire not dragon fire and frankly it doesnt matter at least as of their conversations with grrm in the endgame ppl try and force dany died and came back to life theory when we actually saw jon die and come back to life its strange to me
asoiaf,not_removed,when he raised his whip he saw that the lash was burning his hand as well all of him all of him was burning oh he thought then he began to scream hes dead thats the point of his story to die to deconstruct a common fantasy trope and to turn dorne away from daenerys and towards aegon
asoiaf,not_removed,i think it would be pretty hard to stop drop and roll while dragon flame is melting your skin and eyeballs
asoiaf,not_removed,with the degree to which he was on fire even a thorough stop drop and roll would not have stopped acute inhalation injury to his lungs soot and super heated potentially caustic gasses created by dragon fire would have caused significant damage respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in burn victims
asoiaf,not_removed,thats because they have more for the story quentyn played his part his arc is complete this was the only way it could end its the overused cliche fantasy story gutted and turned on its head the frog prince doesnt get the princess or the dragon or the glory he dies horrifically in a foreign land after losing his friends and innocence along the way when he says oh he is realizing that it was all for nothing look at the first words we see from his chapter adventure stank
asoiaf,not_removed,renly was right
asoiaf,not_removed,spoilers main cool thanks anyhow i like your theory and could imagine that it will take a while until we see a jon pov when looking at the show it might be a nice parallel in the books to see the first pov after or during jon is reborn within the battle in season
asoiaf,not_removed,hes still alive during and after the burning
asoiaf,not_removed,but his skin and eyes werent melting if they were he would have died instantly the oil on his whip just caught fire from a torch and it spread to his hand and clothes its not good but nowhere near fatal
asoiaf,not_removed,but quentyns fire engulfment was very different than other people who weve seen burned by dragonfire like the astapori slave guy whose eyes popped and ran down his face like immediately one would have to argue that rhaegal older and larger than drogon was when he killed the astapori has less hot fire wasnt trying as hard to kill quentyn that particular time or was farther away or something i like to think rhaegal was barely trying to kill quentyn who is obv still alive
asoiaf,not_removed,im not saying he wasnt hurt i could see him coming back in the tattered princes tatters and be a horrible burn victim he wasnt hit with dragon fire at least not directly the oil on his whip caught fire and it spread to his clothes he got burned but we have no evidence that he died in fact we have all kinds of textual foreshadowing that he survived
asoiaf,not_removed,its easy to say his arc is complete when we think he is dead and dont know what grrm might do were he alive like confront doran or ride a dragon or be some part of the aegonariannedany conflict id say its similar to saying cats arc was complete at the red wedding or theons arc was complete when he got himself killed by ramsay for betraying his true home they both came back and even though they had good pseudoendings theres clearly more grrm can pull out to further ones story and even reverberate against their first arcs
asoiaf,not_removed,true but people seem to think hes going to do more than just slowly die ie ride a dragon etc
asoiaf,not_removed,so that part in the books where it says he died what do you make of that
asoiaf,not_removed,the only difference seems to be that his friend archibald mustve pushed him out of the way and then beat on the fires but otherwise he did get a full blast of dragonfire and accordingly his eyes probably did pop spontaneously barristan sees that he only has pools of pus where the eyes were
